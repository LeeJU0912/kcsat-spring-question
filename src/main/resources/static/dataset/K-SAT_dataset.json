		"Everyone knows that dogs make wonderful pets. But many dogs also have different jobs. Some dogs, for example, are used by the police. Often these dogs help people in trouble or find people who are lost. Other dogs work at airports. They sniff out plants, food, and other things that people are not supposed to bring in from other countries. With their help, these things are found and never enter the country. Some other dogs help people keep their homes safe from harmful insects. Once the dogs find the insect nest with their sharp nose, people can have the insects and their nest removed.",
		"I once watched Grandfather looking at a bush. He stood for half an hour, silent and still. As I got closer, I could see he was looking at a sort of bird, but I could not tell what kind of bird it was. Just as I was about to ask him, a common robin flew from the bush. I asked Grandfather what he was looking at. Smiling, he replied, “A robin.” I said, “But Grandfather, it’s just a common robin. What’s so interesting about a robin?” He said, “Just a robin?” Then, he drew a picture of a bird on the ground with a stick and, handing me the stick, he said, “Show me where all the black marks on a robin are located.” I said, “I don’t know.” “Then,” he continued, “each bird is as different as you and I. No single bird is the same as another. We can always learn something new every time we observe a robin. That is also true of everything else in life, every experience, every situation, every bird, tree, rock, water, and leaf. We can never know enough about anything. Finally,” he continued, “you do not even begin to know an animal until you touch it, and feel its spirit. Then and only then can you ever begin to know.”",
		"When I was young, the last wolf in this part of the country was hunted down and killed. The newcomers to this land brought their long­-held fears of the wolf with them. They thought, and still think, that the wolf was successful because he loved to kill and was good at it. To them, he was evil and had to be killed. They didn’t realize he failed more than he succeeded. He went hungry nine times out of ten because his prey got away. But he kept trying until he caught it. When he finally succeeded the tenth time with his force of will, he satisfied his hunger. What they saw as a thirst for killing was really determination. That was the secret of his success: He never quit even with difficulty.",
		"The anger that criticism causes can upset employees, family members and friends, and still not correct the situation which is a problem. George is the safety supervisor for an engineering company. One of his responsibilities is to see that employees wear their hard hats whenever they are on the job in the field. He reported that whenever he came across workers who were not wearing hard hats, he would tell them in a firm voice that they must follow the rules. As a result, the workers would do as he said, but right after he left, the workers would remove the hats. He decided to try a different approach. The next time he found some of the workers not wearing their hard hats, he asked if the hats were uncomfortable or did not fit properly. Then he reminded the men in a pleasant tone of voice that the hat was designed to protect them from injury. The result was increased acceptance of the regulation with no resentment or anger. They began to wear hats more often.",
		"When environmentalists lecture us about the need to save the planet, they sometimes emphasize the importance of saving strangers in distant lands, or the generations that will come after us. Alas, the very distance of these “other people” works against any attempt to motivate us to help them: we just cannot get excited about saving the livelihoods of people we have never met and cannot even picture. Humans are deeply sociable creatures, and will seize the chance to help others―but our capacity to do this depends on a(n) imaginative engagement that is hard to sustain over great distances of time and place.",
		"A recent study from Germany proved that hearing the words “This is going to hurt” before we get a shot triggers the pain response in our brains―we actually feel pain before the needle even touches the skin! Researchers used functional MRI to study people’s brains and found that their pain centers lit up like pinball machines when they heard words that suggested intense pain was coming. What this tells us is that words matter. When we say or listen to words conveying negative or painful thoughts or feelings, our brains immediately activate to feel that pain. In some ways, this is an amazingly human trait―we are very empathetic creatures. But there are situations where that compassion―even for ourselves―might cause problems. When a person with chronic pain talks about her pain with a support group, the close relationships and understanding she finds there are certain to help her. But if during those meetings, she “shares” how she’s been struggling, might she actually be reinforcing that pain in herself and others? It’s certainly a valid question. Whatever the answer is, this area of research demonstrates one thing clearly: We have a tremendous ability to control our own health destinies simply by changing  our internal dialogue. Consider this chain of events: Think positive thoughts. Say positive words. Surround yourself with positive people. What will happen? Your body will eagerly drink in all the corresponding health benefits such as lower blood pressure and lower levels of stress hormones.",
		"In the not-too-distant future, everyday objects such as shoes, carpets, and toothbrushes will contain technology that collects information. You will then be able to personalize these objects, allowing them to change physical state like color or respond to your daily mood. They will also be able to exchange data with other objects and send information to other people. For example, your toothbrush will be capable of analyzing your breath and booking an appointment with your doctor if it detects the smell of lung cancer. In other words, what were once just ordinary objects will be increasingly networked and intelligent. Manufacturers will use the information generated by these smart products to sell you other services or enhance your “ownership experience.”",
		"Daylight Saving Time is a way of making better use of the daylight in the evenings by setting the clocks forward one hour during the longer days of spring and summer, and back again in the fall. Recently, researchers have shown that changing a person’s body clock twice a year has its own significant costs, especially when they lose an hour of sleep in the spring. The day after Daylight Saving Time begins, thousands of drivers suffer from a regional case of jet lag, and accident rates rise by 7% on that day. Even more damaging, one anti-daylight-saving researcher has claimed that students in daylight saving regions spend seven months of the year out of step with their natural biorhythms. Consequently, when the researcher compared the SAT scores of students in Indiana counties that observed Daylight Saving Time, he found that they scored sixteen fewer points than their fellow students in counties that chose to observe standard time all year long. Education policymakers devote millions of dollars each year to closing small SAT performance gaps that unfairly disadvantage one group of students relative to another. These results suggest that eliminating Daylight Saving Time might offer one relatively inexpensive solution.",
		"Armand Hammer was a great businessman who died in 1990 at the age of ninety­-two. He was once asked how a man of his age had the energy to continually travel the world to do business and meet with heads of governments. He said, “I love my work. I can’t wait to start a new day. I never wake up without being full of ideas. Everything is a challenge.” George Bernard Shaw, one of the most successful writers of all time, said something similar about a hundred years earlier. He wrote, “I want to be thoroughly used up when I die, for the harder I work, the more I live.” I think Hammer and Shaw would have agreed with me that nothing can replace hard work in life.",
		"A few years ago, I asked two groups of people to spend an afternoon picking up trash in a park. I told them that they were participating in an experiment to examine the best way to make people take care of their local parks. One group was paid very well for their time, but the other was only given a small amount of cash. After an hour of hard, boring work, everyone rated how much they enjoyed the afternoon. You might think that those who earned a lot of money would have been more positive than those who earned very little. In fact, the result was the exact opposite. The average enjoyment for the well­-paid group was only 2 out of 10, while the poorly paid group’s average rating was an amazing 8.5. It seemed that those who had been paid well thought, “Well, people usually pay me to do things I dislike. I was paid a large amount, so I must dislike cleaning the park.” In contrast, those who received less money thought, “I don’t need to be paid much to do something I enjoy. I worked for very little pay, so I must have enjoyed cleaning the park.” According to the result of this study, it seems that giving excessive rewards may have a negative effect on the attitude of the people doing the work.",
		"Every leader starts in his inner circle, the comfort zone. This is the place where we operate from what we are comfortable with, where we know well what we are capable of and can consistently achieve expected outcomes and results. The goal of the next zone is to push out beyond that area and begin to learn new things. This is known as the learning zone. In a new environment or area, we have to adapt and learn to perform in new ways. Beyond the learning zone lies the courage zone. In this zone, we continue to learn, but the learning curve is steeper because we are challenged to accomplish greater and more difficult things that take a fair amount of courage to achieve. The outermost circle is known as the performance zone ― because once we have mastered the new learning and mustered the courage to experiment with all the new knowledge, we will really start to perform differently from before.",
		"On Jan. 13, 1989, the 27-year-old Italian interior designer, Stefania Follini, went down into a cave near Carlsbad, N. Mex., where she was to live for more than four months as part of an experiment aimed at examining how the stresses of long-term isolation could affect space travel. Pioneer Frontier Explorations, an Italian research foundation, had selected Follini, one of 20 volunteers for the assignment, because she was judged to have inner strength and stamina. For 131 days she lived there alone in a 6 meter by 12 meter Plexiglas module sealed 9 meters under the surface, without sunlight or any other way of measuring time. After about four months, she returned aboveground on schedule. But by her calculations it was only mid-March. During Follini’s underground stay, her sense of time seemed to be longer. Her “day” extended to 25 hours, then to 48 hours. She tended to sleep for 22 to 24 hours, then burst into activity for up to 30 hours. In short, her had internal clock gone out of order.",
		"It is important to understand how vision works, because from the first time you start looking at a situation, you are also making use of your existing knowledge. If you are at a baseball game, how do you know where to look? If you have never been to a game before, then the whole thing is probably a complex mess. You may miss a lot of the action, because you can’t predict what is going to happen next. As you learn more about baseball and develop some understanding of the game, you learn where to look and what objects are important to find. At first you might focus on the pitcher and hitter. Later still, you might notice whether the infielder is playing in or back, or you might c h eck out where the outfielders have chosen to stand for a particular hitter. The more you know about baseball, the more that knowledge informs how you see a game.",
		"Cultures have rarely been completely isolated from outside influence, because throughout human history people have been moving from one place to another, spreading goods and ideas. What is different today, though, is the speed and scope of these interactions. Several decades ago, overnight mail service and direct long­distance telephone calls increased the speed of cross­national communication. Advances in transportation technology have made international trade more cost­effective and international travel more accessible to ordinary citizens. Today the Internet has given people around the world immediate access to the cultural artifacts and ideals of other societies, no matter where they’re located. Clearly, societies are more interdependent than ever, and that matters for individuals. Sometimes the effects are positive. Medical discoveries in the United States or Europe, for instance, can save lives around the world. Globalization gives us a chance to learn about other societies and learn from them. Other times, however, global influence can have disastrous consequences. Many of today’s most urgent societal problems―widespread environmental destruction, large­ and small­scale wars, economic crises, and so on―are a function of globalization to some degree. In short, it is becoming increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to consider ourselves members of a single society unaffected by other societies. All of us are members of our own society and citizens of a world community at the same time.",
		"Judgements about flavor are often influenced by predictions based on the appearance of the food. For example, strawberry-flavored foods would be expected to be red. However, if colored green, because of the association of green foods with flavors such as lime, it would be difficult to identify the flavor as strawberry unless it was very strong. Color intensity also affects flavor perception. A stronger color may cause perception of a stronger flavor in a product, even if the stronger color is simply due to the addition of more food coloring. Texture also can be misleading. A thicker product may be perceived as tasting richer or stronger simply because it is thicker, and not because the thickening agent affects the flavor of the food.",
		"We can start to help our babies learn to love great foods even before they are born. The latest science is uncovering fascinating connections between what moms eat while pregnant and what foods their babies enjoy after birth. Remarkable, but true. Babies in the womb taste, remember, and form preferences for what Mom has been eating. Consider a fascinating study involving carrot juice. As part of the study, one group of pregnant women drank ten ounces of carrot juice four times a week for three weeks in a row. Another group of women in the study drank water. When their babies were old enough to start eating cereal, it was time to look for a difference between the groups. An observer who didn’t know to which group each baby belonged studied the babies as they ate cereal mixed with carrot juice. The babies who lacked this earlier experience of tasting carrot juice in the womb protested and made unhappy faces when they first tasted the juice, whereas the others readily accepted and enjoyed the carrot juice in the cereal. There was a dramatic difference between those who had sampled carrot juice in the womb and those who had not.",
		"Recently on a flight to Asia, I met Debbie, who was warmly greeted by all of the flight attendants and was even welcomed aboard the plane by the pilot. Amazed at all the attention being paid to her, I asked if she worked with the airline. She did not, but she deserved the attention, for this flight marked the milestone of her flying over 4 million miles with this same airline. During the flight I learned that the airline’s CEO personally called her to thank her for using their service for a long time and she received a catalogue of fine luxury gifts to choose from. Debbie was able to acquire this special treatment for one very important reason: she was a loyal customer to that one airline.",
		"Food is one of the most important tools you can use as a manager. Having a full stomach makes people feel satisfied and happier. Eating together gives employees time to make connections with each other. Providing an occasional snack or paying for a lunch now and then can help your employees feel appreciated and make the office feel more welcoming. These do not need to be elaborate setups. If you have a small budget, you’re not going to want to buy lunch at a restaurant for your entire group. Bringing in some cookies once in a while is enough; you can also encourage employees to bring in food themselves. The key to using food effectively is for it not to become a planned event. If everyone knows you bring donuts to the Friday morning meeting, it becomes an expectation and not a surprise. To create goodwill, the food must appear to be unexpected. It is also a good idea to praise employees who bring food in without being asked; this creates an atmosphere of sharing.",
		"Perhaps the biggest mistake that most investors make when they first begin investing is getting into a panic over losses. This is a major obstacle to making a strong and long­-lasting plan. We work hard for our money, and we want to see it grow and work hard for us. But what most beginning investors don’t understand is that investing in the stock market is a risk, and that with risk, you sometimes take losses. Although an investment may be falling in price, it doesn’t mean you have to abandon it in a rush. The point is, as investors, we should not focus on short­-term losses, but rather on long­term growth. Therefore, be patient when it comes to not only your stock portfolio but to personal investments as well.",
		"Last year, Roberta Vinci had a tennis match with No.1­ranked Serena Williams in the US Open. No one thought Vinci would win, but she did. In an interview after the match, Vinci said she did not think it was possible, so she tried not to think about winning. “In my mind I said, ‘Hit the ball and run. Don’t think, just run.’ And then I won.” Vinci’s attitude stands strongly against today’s culture where we emphasize positivity too much. If you are feeling like something is impossible, then you are told that you are just not thinking positively enough. However, if you really believe that something is impossible, or that you won’t succeed, then trying to convince yourself otherwise can increase your anxiety, and actually doesn’t help at all. Therefore, sometimes the best way to accomplish a difficult objective is to stop thinking that it is possible, and just take things one step at a time. Remember, focusing too much on the goal can prevent you from achieving the thing you want. Forget about it. Just hit the ball, and run.",
		"Consider your typical day. You wake up in the morning and pour yourself juice from oranges grown in Florida and coffee from beans grown in Brazil. Over breakfast, you watch a news program broadcast from New York on your television made in Japan. You get dressed in clothes made of cotton grown in Georgia and sewn in factories in Thailand. Every day, you rely on many people, most of whom you do not know, to provide you with the goods and services that you enjoy. Such interdependence is possible because people trade with one another. Those people providing you goods and services are not acting out of generosity. Nor is some government agency directing them to satisfy your desires. Instead, people provide you and other consumers with the goods and services they produce because they get something in return.",
		"Imagine Jaws without a hungry white shark, Superman without Kryptonite, or the tale of Little Red Riding Hood without a scary wolf: The teenagers would have had a great summer at the beach, Superman would not have had a worry in the world, and Little Red Riding Hood would visit her grandmother and then go home. Words like “boring” and “predictable” spring to mind! Movie director Nils Malmros once said, “Paradise on a Sunday afternoon sounds great, but it sure is boring on film.” In other words, too much harmony and not enough conflict makes for a story that is about as exciting as watching paint dry. Conflict is the driving force of a good story. No conflict, no story. But why is this the case? The answer lies in human nature. As humans, we instinctively look for balance and harmony in our lives. We simply don’t like being out of tune with our surroundings and ourselves. So, as soon as harmony is disrupted, we do whatever we can to restore it. We avoid unpleasant situations, feelings of stress or anxiety. If we have an unresolved problem with our loved ones, or our colleagues, it bothers us until we clear the air and return to a state of harmony. When faced with a problem—a conflict—we instinctively seek to find a solution. Conflict forces us to act. Thus, a story is set in motion by a change that disturbs this sense of harmony.",
		"People are attracted to individuals and things they cannot readily obtain. In the case with things, people are more attracted to a desired object because it is out of their reach. When the object of desire is finally gained, the attraction for the object rapidly decreases. Christmas presents provide a good example of this phenomenon. Toys children wanted all year long are thrown away several days after they are taken from gift boxes under the tree. The phenomenon also holds true for human interaction, particularly in the early stages of a developing relationship. The common dating rule has scientific merit. An individual should not always make himself or herself readily available to the person they are targeting for a longer-term relationship. A certain level of unavailability will make you more of a mystery and a challenge.",
		"When Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final volume of J. K. Rowling’s fantasy series about the adventures of a boy wizard, was released in the United States in 2007, it sold 8.3 million copies in its first 24 hours on sale. Was the last Harry Potter book that good? Perhaps it and the earlier six volumes were genuinely brilliant─despite the fact that eight publishers declined to publish the first volume. But although success is at least partly determined by intrinsic quality, it is also possible that what people come to like depends very much on what they believe others like. In such a world, the explanation for why a particular book becomes a hit may be as simple as this publisher’s: “It sold well because lots of people bought it.” Because social information is now being shared much more widely across virtual and actual borders than in the past, cultural artifacts such as books and movies can now ‘snowball’ in popularity in ways they could not a century ago, turning cultural commerce into a collection of difficult-to-predict, winner-take-all markets. Tiny differences in performance or product quality translate into vast differences in payoff.",
		"In small towns the same workman makes chairs and doors and tables, and often the same person builds houses. And it is, of course, impossible for a man of many trades to be skilled in all of them. In large cities, on the other hand, because many people make demands on each trade, one trade alone—very often even less than a whole trade—is enough to support a man. For instance, one man makes shoes for men, and another for women. And there are places even where one man earns a living by only stitching shoes, another by cutting them out, and another by sewing the uppers together. Such skilled workers may have used simple tools, but their specialization did result in more efficient and productive work.",
		"When someone has helped you, but has perhaps not done all that you requested, focus on what the person has done, not on what he hasn’t. Although this would seem to be morally obvious, many people are so caught up with their own needs that they ignore the good done for them. A teacher once received a letter from a student, asking fourteen unrelated questions on a variety of subjects. The teacher wrote back a long reply in which he dealt with thirteen of the questions. He soon received a return letter from the student, who not only noted the omission, but expressed no thanks for what the teacher had written. Though the teacher was a man of great patience, he was hurt by the student’s behavior: “Not only was there no word of thanks, but at the beginning of your letter you reminded me that there was one of your questions to which I forgot to give an answer. Was that the proper beginning and response to a letter of ten pages?” He went on to tell the student: “I mention this not because I need your thanks, but because of my love for you and concern that you should not become a person who denies the good done for him.”",
		"If we lived on a planet where nothing ever changed, there would be little to do. There would be nothing to figure out and there would be no reason for science. And if we lived in an unpredictable world, where things changed in random or very complex ways, we would not be able to figure things out. Again, there would be no such thing as science. But we live in an in-between universe, where things change, but according to rules. If I throw a stick up in the air, it always falls down. If the sun sets in the west, it always rises again the next morning in the east. And so it becomes possible to figure things out. We can do science, and with it we can improve our lives.",
		"With thousands of websites, television channels, text messages, and phone calls, it is easy to become drowned in a flood of media. We often try to absorb too much in too many ways, to enjoy music while at the same time e-mailing someone on our laptops and being interrupted by constant messages on our mobile phones. Is there any one thing I have learned to help me survive? Yes. Try to stick to one type of media at a time. To a large extent we have a very limited ability to focus. If we try to absorb too many things at once, they often conflict. Just the action of talking takes up much of our working memory. Trying to talk about complex subjects and drive well at the same time pushes our abilities to their limits. This is one of the reasons why people still go to cinemas for good films; it is a(n) full experience because all mobile phones are switched off. Many forms of communication are only really enjoyed one at a time.",
		"Why doesn’t the modern American accent sound similar to a British accent? After all, didn’t the British colonize the U.S.? Experts believe that British residents and the colonists who settled America all sounded the same back in the 18th century, and they probably all sounded more like modern Americans than modern Brits. The accent that we identify as British today was developed around the time of the American Revolution by people of low birth rank who had become wealthy during the Industrial Revolution. To distinguish themselves from other commoners, these people developed new ways of speaking to set themselves apart and demonstrate their new, elevated social status. In the 19th century, this distinctive accent was standardized as Received Pronunciation and taught widely by pronunciation tutors to people who wanted to learn to speak fashionably.",
		"Without a doubt, dinosaurs are a popular topic for kids across the planet. Something about these extinct creatures from long ago seems to hold almost everyone’s attention, young or old, boy or girl. Though we don’t know a lot about dinosaurs, what we do know is fascinating to children of all ages. But why? “I think the reason kids like dinosaurs so much is that dinosaurs were big, were different from anything alive today, and are extinct. So they are imagination engines,” explains Jack Horner, a technical advisor for the Jurassic Park films. Teachers all over the country would agree. Dinosaurs are studied in classrooms each year, not only for the science behind the topic, but also because of the creative thinking it seems to foster in students. “The best part about this is what happens with their writing,” Jennifer Zimmerman, a primary school teacher in Washington, D.C., says. “I think it’s the mystery of dinosaurs―the fact that there are still so many things we don’t know―that inspires them to use that topic in their journals.” Children also feel powerful when asked to draw a dinosaur. Since no one knows what colors dinosaurs actually were, a child can use what information he has―and his imagination―to draw a dinosaur as he sees it.",
		"I asked Kenichi Ohmae, a global management consultant, if he could sense whether a company was going to be successful. Was there something he could smell or sense when he was in an organization that suggested this company was going to be a winner? He said, “Yes,” and added “if a company is not afraid to ask questions, if everyone asks questions from the CEO down to the office boy, if they ask questions like ‘Why do we do it this way?’ then this company will succeed.” So the inquisitive mind is an essential ingredient for future success. This is echoed by Susan Greenfield, a British scientist. She confirmed the need to challenge old practices. She wanted to deliver the message to budding young scientists that searching for the new possibilities with the inquisitive mind would be essential to be successful. And she said, “Never take anything for granted: always question everything. Always question old practices. Look at the evidence and if you are not satisfied with it, you can see an alternative. You have to question the out-of-date ideas.”",
		"Since a great deal of day­-to­-day academic work is boring and repetitive, you need to be well motivated to keep doing it. A mathematician sharpens her pencils, works on a proof, tries a few approaches, gets nowhere, and finishes for the day. A writer sits down at his desk, produces a few hundred words, decides they are no good, throws them in the bin, and hopes for better inspiration tomorrow. To produce something worthwhile—if it ever happens—may require years of such fruitless labor. The Nobel Prize­winning biologist Peter Medawar said that about four­-fifths of his time in science was wasted, adding sadly that “nearly all scientific research leads nowhere.” What kept all of these people going when things were going badly was their passion for their subject. Without such passion, they would have achieved nothing.",
		"Think of the most famous scientists you know—Isaac Newton, Louis Pasteur, Albert Einstein, Thomas Edison, Pierre and Marie Curie, Stephen Hawking, and so on. What do all these people have in common? Well, for one thing, they’re all very smart. In some cases they even taught themselves most of what they knew about their particular subject. In fact, Sir Isaac Newton had to invent a new branch of mathematics (calculus) just to solve the problems he was trying to do in physics. There is something else they all had in common that set them apart from the other smart people of their time— their ability to ask questions. Just having a good brain isn’t always enough. To be a great scientist, you need to be able to look at a problem that hundreds, maybe even thousands, of people have already looked at and have been unable to solve, and ask the question in a new way. Then you take that question and come up with a new way to answer it. That is what made Newton and the others so famous. They coupled intelligence with a curiosity that said, “I want to know the answer to this.” After coming up with the right questions, they discovered ways of answering those questions and became famous for their discoveries.",
		"One outcome of motivation is behavior that takes considerable effort. For example, if you are motivated to buy a good car, you will research vehicles online, look at ads, visit dealerships, and so on. Likewise, if you are motivated to lose weight, you will buy low­-fat foods, eat smaller portions, and exercise. Motivation not only drives the final behaviors that bring a goal closer but also creates willingness to expend time and energy on preparatory behaviors. Thus, someone motivated to buy a new smartphone may earn extra money for it, drive through a storm to reach the store, and then wait in line to buy it.",
		"Hundreds of thousands of people journeyed far to take part in the Canadian fur trade. Many saw how inhabitants of the northern regions stored their food in the winter―by burying the meats and vegetables in the snow. But probably few of them had thoughts about how this custom might relate to other fields. One who did was a young man named Clarence Birdseye. He was amazed to find that freshly caught fish and duck, frozen quickly in such a fashion, kept their taste and texture. He started wondering: Why can’t we sell food in America that operates on the same basic principle? With this thought, the frozen foods industry was born. He made something extraordinary from what, for the northern folk, was the ordinary practice of preserving food. So, what went on in his mind when he observed this means of storage? Something mysterious happened in his curious, fully engaged mind. Curiosity is a way of adding value to what you see. In the case of Birdseye, it was strong enough to lift him out of the routine way of seeing things. It set the stage for innovation and discovery, for coming up with something new.",
		"One CEO in one of Silicon Valley’s most innovative companies has what would seem like a boring, creativity­-killing routine. He holds a three­-hour meeting that starts at 9:00 A.M. one day a week. It is never missed or rescheduled at a different time. It is mandatory―so much so that even in this global firm all the executives know never to schedule any travel that will conflict with the meeting. At first glance there is nothing particularly unique about this. But what is unique is the quality of ideas that come out of the regular meetings. Because the CEO has eliminated the mental cost involved in planning the meeting or thinking about who will or won’t be there, people can focus on creative problem solving.",
		"It’s reasonable to assume that every adult alive today has, at some point in their life, expressed or heard from someone else a variation of the following: “Where did all the time go?” “I can’t believe it’s the New Year. Time flies!” “Enjoy it. One day you’ll wake up and you’ll be 50.” While different on the surface, the sentiment behind these phrases is the same: time feels like it moves faster as we get older. But why does this happen? According to psychologist Robert Ornstein, the speed of time and our perception of it is heavily influenced by how much new information is available for our minds to absorb and process. In essence, the more new information we take in, the slower time feels. This theory could explain in part why time feels slower for children. Assigned the enormous task of absorbing and processing all this new perceptual and sensory information around them, their brains are continuously alert and attentive. Why? Because everything is unfamiliar. Consider the mind of a child: having experienced so little, the world is a mysterious and fascinating place. Adults and children may live in the same world, but reality for a child is vastly different―full of wonders and curiosities and miraculous little events that most adults ignore. Perhaps this is why we think so fondly about the joy of childhood, that freedom of mind and body before the world becomes familiar and predictable.",
		"If you follow science news, you will have noticed that cooperation among animals has become a hot topic in the mass media. For example, in late 2007 the science media widely reported a study by Claudia Rutte and Michael Taborsky suggesting that rats display what they call “generalized reciprocity.” They each provided help to an unfamiliar and unrelated individual, based on their own previous experience of having been helped by an unfamiliar rat. Rutte and Taborsky trained rats in a cooperative task of pulling a stick to obtain food for a partner. Rats who had been helped previously by an unknown partner were more likely to help others. Before this research was conducted, generalized reciprocity was thought to be unique to humans.",
		"Plants are nature’s alchemists; they are expert at transforming water, soil, and sunlight into an array of precious substances. Many of these substances are beyond the ability of human beings to conceive. While we were perfecting consciousness and learning to walk on two feet, they were, by the same process of natural selection, inventing photosynthesis (the astonishing trick of converting sunlight into food) and perfecting organic chemistry. As it turns out, many of the plants’ discoveries in chemistry and physics have served us well. From plants come chemical compounds that nourish and heal and delight the senses. Why would they go to all this trouble? Why should plants bother to devise the recipes for so many complex molecules and then expend the energy needed to manufacture them? Plants can’t move, which means they can’t escape the creatures that feed on them. A great many of the chemicals plants produce are designed, by natural selection, to compel other creatures to leave them alone: deadly poisons, foul flavors, toxins to confuse the minds of predators. Plants also can’t change location or extend their reproductive range without help. Many other of the substances plants make draw other creatures to them by stirring and gratifying their desire. It is this fact of plants’ immobility that causes them to make chemicals.",
		"Most of us are suspicious of rapid cognition. We believe that the quality of the decision is directly related to the time and effort that went into making it. That’s what we tell our children: “Haste makes waste.” “Look before you leap.” “Stop and think.” “Don’t judge a book by its cover.” We believe that we are always better off gathering as much information as possible and spending as much time as possible in careful consideration. But there are moments, particularly in time­-driven, critical situations, when haste does not make waste, when our snap judgments and first impressions can offer better means of making sense of the world. Survivors have somehow learned this lesson and have developed and sharpened their skill of rapid cognition.",
		"Creativity is a skill we usually consider uniquely human. For all of human history, we have been the most creative beings on Earth. Birds can make their nests, ants can make their hills, but no other species on Earth comes close to the level of creativity we humans display. However, just in the last decade we have acquired the ability to do amazing things with computers, like developing robots. With the artificial intelligence boom of the 2010s, computers can now recognize faces, translate languages, take calls for you, write poems, and beat players at the world’s most complicated board game, to name a few things. All of a sudden, we must face the possibility that our ability to be creative is not unrivaled.",
		"Mobility provides a change to the environment for journalists. Newspaper stories, television reports, and even early online reporting (prior to communication technology such as tablets and smartphones) required one central place to which a reporter would submit his or her news story for printing, broadcast, or posting. Now, though, a reporter can shoot video, record audio, and type directly on their smartphones or tablets and post a news story instantly. Journalists do not need to report to a central location where they all contact sources, type, or edit video. A story can be instantaneously written, shot, and made available to the entire world. The news cycle, and thus the job of the journalist, never takes a break. Thus the “24­hour” news cycle that emerged from the rise of cable TV is now a thing of the past. The news “cycle” is really a constant.",
		"People engage in typical patterns of interaction based on the relationship between their roles and the roles of others. Employers are expected to interact with employees in a certain way, as are doctors with patients. In each case, actions are restricted by the role responsibilities and obligations associated with individuals’ positions within society. For instance, parents and children are linked by certain rights, privileges, and obligations. Parents are responsible for providing their children with the basic necessities of life―food, clothing, shelter, and so forth. These expectations are so powerful that not meeting them may make the parents vulnerable to charges of negligence or abuse. Children, in turn, are expected to do as their parents say. Thus, interactions within a relationship are functions not only of the individual personalities of the people involved but also of the role requirements associated with the statuses they have.",
		"Remember that patience is always of the essence. If an apology is not accepted, thank the individual for hearing you out and leave the door open for if and when he wishes to reconcile. Be conscious of the fact that just because someone accepts your apology does not mean she has fully forgiven you. It can take time, maybe a long time, before the injured party can completely let go and fully trust you again. There is little you can do to speed this process up. If the person is truly important to you, it is worthwhile to give him or her the time and space needed to heal. Do not expect the person to go right back to acting normally immediately.",
		"When reading another scientist’s findings, think critically about the experiment. Ask yourself: Were observations recorded during or after the experiment? Do the conclusions make sense? Can the results be repeated? Are the sources of information reliable? You should also ask if the scientist or group conducting the experiment was unbiased. Being unbiased means that you have no special interest in the outcome of the experiment. For example, if a drug company pays for an experiment to test how well one of its new products works, there is a special interest involved: The drug company profits if the experiment shows that its product is effective. Therefore, the experimenters aren’t objective. They might ensure the conclusion is positive and benefits the drug company. When assessing results, think about any biases that may be present!",
		"As the tenth anniversary of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, approached, 9/11­related media stories peaked in the days immediately surrounding the anniversary date and then dropped off rapidly in the weeks thereafter. Surveys conducted during those times asked citizens to choose two “especially important” events from the past seventy years. Two weeks prior to the anniversary, before the media blitz began, about 30 percent of respondents named 9/11. But as the anniversary drew closer, and the media treatment intensified, survey respondents started identifying 9/11 in increasing numbers―to a high of 65 percent. Two weeks later, though, after reportage had decreased to earlier levels, once again only about 30 percent of the participants placed it among their two especially important events of the past seventy years. Clearly, the amount of news coverage can make a big difference in the perceived significance of an issue among observers as they are exposed to the coverage.",
		"There is nothing more fundamental to the human spirit than the need to be mobile. It is the intuitive force that sparks our imaginations and opens pathways to life-changing opportunities. It is the catalyst for progress and personal freedom. Public transportation has been vital to that progress and freedom for more than two centuries. The transportation industry has always done more than carry travelers from one destination to another. It connects people, places, and possibilities. It provides access to what people need, what they love, and what they aspire to become. In so doing, it grows communities, creates jobs, strengthens the economy, expands social and commercial networks, saves time and energy, and helps millions of people achieve a better life.",
		"One of the most important aspects of providing good care is making sure that an animal’s needs are being met consistently and predictably. Like humans, animals need a sense of control. So an animal who may get enough food but doesn’t know when the food will appear and can see no consistent schedule may experience distress. We can provide a sense of control by ensuring that our animal’s environment is predictable: there is always water available and always in the same place. There is always food when we get up in the morning and after our evening walk. There will always be a time and place to eliminate, without having to hold things in to the point of discomfort. Human companions can display consistent emotional support, rather than providing love one moment and withholding love the next. When animals know what to expect, they can feel more confident and calm.",
		"In a culture where there is a belief that you can have anything you truly want, there is no problem in choosing. Many cultures, however, do not maintain this belief. In fact, many people do not believe that life is about getting what you want. Life is about doing what you are supposed to do. The reason they have trouble making choices is they believe that what they may want is not related to what they are supposed to do. The weight of outside considerations is greater than their desires. When this is an issue in a group, we discuss what makes for good decisions. If a person can be unburdened from their cares and duties and, just for a moment, consider what appeals to them, they get the chance to sort out what is important to them. Then they can consider and negotiate with their external pressures.",
		"Sometimes it is the simpler product that gives a business a competitive advantage. Until recently, bicycles had to have many gears, often 15 or 20, for them to be considered high­-end. But fixed­-gear bikes with minimal features have become more popular, as those who buy them are happy to pay more for much less. The overall profitability of these bikes is much higher than the more complex ones because they do a single thing really well without the cost of added complexity. Companies should be careful of getting into a war over adding more features with their competitors, as this will increase cost and almost certainly reduce profitability because of competitive pressure on price.",
		"We don’t send telegraphs to communicate anymore, but it’s a great metaphor for giving advance notice. Sometimes, you must inform those close to you of upcoming change by conveying important information well in advance. There’s a huge difference between saying, “From now on, we will do things differently,” which doesn’t give people enough time to understand and accept the change, and saying something like, “Starting next month, we’re going to approach things differently.” Telegraphing empowers people to adapt. Telegraphing involves the art of seeing an upcoming event or circumstance and giving others enough time to process and accept the change. Telegraph anything that will take people out of what is familiar and comfortable to them. This will allow processing time for them to accept the circumstances and make the most of what’s happening.",
		"Generalization without specific examples that humanize writing is boring to the listener and to the reader. Who wants to read platitudes all day? Who wants to hear the words great, greater, best, smartest, finest, humanitarian, on and on and on without specific examples? Instead of using these ‘nothing words,’ leave them out completely and just describe the particulars. There is nothing worse than reading a scene in a novel in which a main character is described up front as heroic or brave or tragic or funny, while thereafter, the writer quickly moves on to something else. That’s no good, no good at all. You have to use less one word descriptions and more detailed, engaging descriptions if you want to make something real.",
		"One of the big questions faced this past year was how to keep innovation rolling when people were working entirely virtually. But experts say that digital work didn’t have a negative effect on innovation and creativity. Working within limits pushes us to solve problems. Overall, virtual meeting platforms put more constraints on communication and collaboration than face­-to­-face settings. For instance, with the press of a button, virtual meeting hosts can control the size of breakout groups and enforce time constraints; only one person can speak at a time; nonverbal signals, particularly those below the shoulders, are diminished; “seating arrangements” are assigned by the platform, not by individuals; and visual access to others may be limited by the size of each participant’s screen. Such restrictions are likely to stretch participants beyond their usual ways of thinking, boosting creativity.",
		"We worry that the robots are taking our jobs, but just as common a problem is that the robots are taking our judgment. In the large warehouses so common behind the scenes of today’s economy, human ‘pickers’ hurry around grabbing products off shelves and moving them to where they can be packed and dispatched. In their ears are headpieces: the voice of ‘Jennifer’, a piece of software, tells them where to go and what to do, controlling the smallest details of their movements. Jennifer breaks down instructions into tiny chunks, to minimise error and maximise productivity ― for example, rather than picking eighteen copies of a book off a shelf, the human worker would be politely instructed to pick five. Then another five. Then yet another five. Then another three. Working in such conditions reduces people to machines made of flesh. Rather than asking us to think or adapt, the Jennifer unit takes over the thought process and treats workers as an inexpensive source of some visual processing and a pair of opposable thumbs.",
		"To demonstrate how best to defeat the habit of delaying, Dan Ariely, a professor of psychology and behavioral economics, performed an experiment on students in three of his classes at MIT. He assigned all classes three reports over the course of the semester. The first class had to choose three due dates for themselves, up to and including the last day of class. The second had no deadlines — all three papers just had to be submitted by the last day of class. In his third class, he gave students three set deadlines over the course of the semester. At the end of the semester, he found that students with set deadlines received the best grades, the students with no deadlines had the worst, and those who could choose their own deadlines fell somewhere in the middle. Ariely concludes that restricting freedom — whether by the professor or by students who recognize their own tendencies to delay things—improves self-control and performance.",
		"People differ in how quickly they can reset their biological clocks to overcome jet lag, and the speed of recovery depends on the direction of travel. Generally, it’s easier to fly westward and lengthen your day than it is to fly eastward and shorten it. This east­-west difference in jet lag is sizable enough to have an impact on the performance of sports teams. Studies have found that teams flying westward perform significantly better than teams flying eastward in professional baseball and college football. A more recent study of more than 46,000 Major League Baseball games found additional evidence that eastward travel is tougher than westward travel.",
		"Individuals who perform at a high level in their profession often have instant credibility with others. People admire them, they want to be like them, and they feel connected to them. When they speak, others listen―even if the area of their skill has nothing to do with the advice they give. Think about a world­-famous basketball player. He has made more money from endorsements than he ever did playing basketball. Is it because of his knowledge of the products he endorses? No. It’s because of what he can do with a basketball. The same can be said of an Olympic medalist swimmer. People listen to him because of what he can do in the pool. And when an actor tells us we should drive a certain car, we don’t listen because of his expertise on engines. We listen because we admire his talent. Excellence connects. If you possess a high level of ability in an area, others may desire to connect with you because of it.",
		"Many people are terrified to fly in airplanes. Often, this fear stems from a lack of control. The pilot is in control, not the passengers, and this lack of control instills fear. Many potential passengers are so afraid they choose to drive great distances to get to a destination instead of flying. But their decision to drive is based solely on emotion, not logic. Logic says that statistically, the odds of dying in a car crash are around 1 in 5,000, while the odds of dying in a plane crash are closer to 1 in 11 million. If you’re going to take a risk, especially one that could possibly involve your well­being, wouldn’t you want the odds in your favor? However, most people choose the option that will cause them the least amount of anxiety. Pay attention to the thoughts you have about taking the risk and make sure you’re basing your decision on facts, not just feelings.",
		"A remarkable characteristic of the visual system is that it has the ability of adapting itself. Psychologist George M. Stratton made this clear in an impressive self-experiment. Stratton wore reversing glasses for several days, which literally turned the world upside down for him. In the beginning, this caused him great difficulties: just putting food in his mouth with a fork was a challenge for him. With time, however, his visual system adjusted to the new stimuli from reality, and he was able to act normally in his environment again, even seeing it upright when he concentrated. As he took off his reversing glasses, he was again confronted with problems: he used the wrong hand when he wanted to reach for something, for example. Fortunately, Stratton could reverse the perception, and he did not have to wear reversing glasses for the rest of his life. For him, everything returned to normal after one day.",
		"Every species has certain climatic requirements—what degree of heat or cold it can endure, for example. When the climate changes, the places that satisfy those requirements change, too. Species are forced to follow. All creatures are capable of some degree of movement. Even creatures that appear immobile, like trees and barnacles, are capable of dispersal at some stage of their life—as a seed, in the case of the tree, or as a larva, in the case of the barnacle. A creature must get from the place it is born—often occupied by its parent—to a place where it can survive, grow, and reproduce. From fossils, scientists know that even creatures like trees moved with surprising speed during past periods of climate change.",
		"Today, 3­D printing technology is used only in companies and universities, but the prices are now getting lower and the quality better. We can imagine every home having a 3­D printer in the future. Note that 3­D printing technology doesn’t require an original object to copy: any drawing will do, as long as it describes the piece precisely. Soon anyone can use a home sketching tool to produce the proper design, and then the home printer will be able to create the actual physical object. If you can draw it, you can make it. For example, if you don’t have enough dinner plates for your guests, you can “print out” some real plates from your sketch.",
		"One summer a teenager I knew, a young man who had the highest IQ ever recorded by the local school system, repainted a neighbor’s roof. He climbed up with his paint bucket and roller and started to paint ― from the bottom to the top. When he got to the highest point of the roof, he realized he was in trouble. On the way down, he slipped on the fresh paint, fell off the roof, and broke his leg. He was very good at math and reading, but he couldn’t think of the idea of starting from the top. Sometimes common sense and practical know­how are more useful than intellectual ability.",
		"Tom was a professional basketball player. In his last championship game, his mistake caused his team to lose the game. For years after his retirement, he kept thinking about the mistake. When people asked, “Why are you depressed most of the time?” he answered, “I was a fool to make such a mistake. How else do you expect me to feel?” Even if people told him that it was his thinking that was depressing him, he would say, “No, it isn’t. I’m depressed because I made the mistake, not because I’m thinking about it. In fact, I seldom think about it.” Tom didn’t see his thinking as the cause of his suffering.",
		"One of the most important skills you can develop in human relations is the ability to see things from others’ points of view. It’s one of the keys to satisfying customers, maintaining a marriage, and raising children. All human interactions are improved by the ability to put yourself in another person’s shoes. How? Look beyond yourself, your own interests, and your own world. When you work to examine a problem in the light of another’s history and discover the interests and concerns of others, you begin to see what others see. And that is a powerful thing.",
		"Amusement parks have started selling the right to jump the line. Traditionally, visitors may spend hours waiting in line for the most popular rides. Now, Universal Studios Hollywood and other theme parks offer a way to avoid the wait: for about twice the price of standard admission, they’ll sell you a pass to the head of the line. Quick access to the Revenge of the Mummy thrill ride may not be as wrong as quick access to an airport security check. Still, some observers complain about the practice, seeing it as destructive of a wholesome civil habit: one journalist wrote, “Gone are the days when the theme­-park line was the great equalizer. Those days everybody waited their turns in democratic fashion.”",
		"New research conducted recently suggests that social isolation leads people to make risky financial decisions. When people don’t feel connected to their social network, they often try to buy satisfaction. And the more rejected people feel, the more likely they are to see money as a way to solve their problems. An experiment, which involved randomly approaching people in public places in Hong Kong, found that those who said they felt more rejected in general tended to report more betting on lotteries, more gambling at the horse track or casino, and riskier investment strategies than those who reported feeling more socially connected. Rejection increased their beliefs linking money to a better life and these beliefs entirely accounted for the riskier choices with their money.",
		"What is the difference between fines and fees? Fines mean moral disapproval, whereas fees are simply prices that imply no moral judgment. When we charge a fine for littering, we’re saying that littering is wrong. Tossing a beer can into the Grand Canyon not only charges cleanup costs. It reflects a bad attitude that society wants to discourage. Suppose the fine is $100, and a wealthy hiker decides it’s worth the convenience of not having to carry his empty cans out of the park. He treats the fine as a fee and tosses his cans into the Grand Canyon. He pays up, but we think he’s done something wrong. By treating the Grand Canyon as an expensive trash can, he has failed to appreciate it properly.",
		"Some study guides advocate filling out elaborate calendars so you will know what you are supposed to be doing during every minute, hour, and day throughout the entire semester. They would have you allocate the time periods to study each subject, to eat meals, to engage in athletic events, to socialize with friends, and so forth. I feel that this approach is a serious mistake. Not only will students be unwilling to follow such schedules, it is undesirable for humans to attempt such strict arrangements. Following such a schedule would lead you to feel that your whole life is predetermined and you would quickly become bored with your studies. As Frederick Nietzsche, the German philosopher, inquired, “Is not life a hundred times too short for us to bore ourselves?” Use calendars for their intended purpose to record significant dates. Write down the dates of important events, such as exams and deadlines for term papers, so you will know how much time you have to prepare for them. Don’t let calendars regulate your life.",
		"According to Richard Thaler’s theory, people value an object more if their ownership is clearly established. In a classic study, people were asked to assess the value of coffee cups which had been gifted to them. Another group in the study was also asked to estimate the value of coffee cups, but these coffee cups were not owned by anyone. The subjects who owned their coffee cups consistently valued them higher than the other subjects, and in some cases they said that they would prefer to keep their coffee cups, even if they were offered money for them. However, it seems to apply specifically to objects. When people in a similar study were offered tokens which could be exchanged for coffee cups, the cognitive bias was not observed, suggesting that people formed an attachment to the specific object, not to an abstract concept.",
		"When you ask people to rank the days of the week in order of preference, Friday is ranked higher than Sunday, although Friday is a workday and Sunday is not. Would people rather work than play? Not quite. Then, why do people prefer Friday to Sunday? The reason is that Friday brings promise―the promise of the weekend ahead and all the activities we have planned. Sunday, while a day of rest, does not bring with it the joy of anticipation. To the contrary, although we may be having a picnic in the park or walking around town, these delightful activities are damaged by the anticipation of the full workweek ahead. Whether good or bad, our emotional state is determined both by feelings that are triggered by the world at present and those generated by our expectations of the future.",
		"One of the reasons I’ve collected a large library of books over the years is because books are a great go-to resource. Other than having a conversation with someone who has accomplished what you hope to achieve, in my experience books and published works offer the most in terms of documented research and role models for success. The Internet has quickly become an invaluable tool as well. Whether offline or online, you’re trying to find people who have already gone down the road you’re traveling, so you can research, model, and benchmark their experience. A college professor once told me, “Gary, you’re smart, but people have lived before you. You’re not the first person to dream big, so you’d be wise to study what others have learned first, and then build your actions on the back of their lessons.”",
		"Let me give you a piece of advice that might change your mind about being courageous. Suppose that your doctor said that you have six months to live and recommended that you do everything you ever wanted to do. What would you do? Have you always wanted to sky dive, or climb cliffs, or maybe live alone in the woods for a month but been afraid you might be harmed? What difference would it make if you now attempted it? You’d almost certainly live through it and it would enrich the time you had left. Wouldn’t it be nice to go out saying you had faced all your fears? Why do you wait till you have a death sentence? If it’s that important to you, do it now.",
		"It is not always easy to eat well when you have a newborn baby. It can seem like you do not have time to prepare tasty nutritious meals or even to eat them. You will need to learn the following trick. Try not to wait until you are really hungry to think about eating. When you have a newborn baby, preparing food will probably take longer than usual. If you start when you are already hungry, you will be absolutely starving before the food is ready. When you are starving and tired, eating healthy is difficult. You may want to eat fatty fast food, chocolates, cookies or chips. This type of food is okay sometimes, but not every day.",
		"In a study of 500 marriages, one researcher determined that marital success is more closely linked to communication skills than to any other factor. Above all, get rid of distractions: the TV, the Internet, and e-mail. What you and your spouse need is quality time to talk. My wife and I have some of our best talks on our evening walks. A quiet drive can work wonders too. One hardworking couple I know regularly gets together for lunch. They know it’s essential. A marriage without time to communicate is a marriage headed over a cliff. How can you settle differences if you don’t honestly talk them out? And it’s not just talking. It’s listening. As a counselor, I’ve listened to people for hours. The results are incredible. I’ve seen people move from total confusion to total clarity just because I listened to them. Something powerful happens inside most people when they are listened to.",
		"Friends. Can you imagine what life would be like without them? Who would you hang out with during lunch? Who would you tell about the new boy in your history class? Let’s face it. Without friends, the world would be a pretty lonely place. Although friends and friendship mean different things to different people, most people realize that friends are pretty important. While it’s fun to read what other people have said about friendship, what matters most is what you think of when you hear the word “friend.” Your own personal definition of friendship has a lot to do with what kind of friend you are. If, for instance, you believe that loyalty goes hand in hand with friendship, you are probably a loyal friend yourself. If you believe a friend is someone who’ll go out of her way for you, maybe just to pick up a homework assignment you missed when you were sick, it’s likely that you’d also go out of your way for your friends.",
		"To fight productivity­-slowing energy burnout typical in offices during the day, a design firm in Amsterdam has recently introduced a new method for ensuring that its employees go home on time and rest. Every day promptly at 6 p.m., everyone’s desks are raised to the ceiling by iron cables, and the space is then transformed into either a dance floor or yoga studio open for free to the community. The creative director of the firm, Sander Veenendaal, stated that this new measure has not only improved workers’ lives, but helped to build up their brand as well. Enforced rest time is becoming a serious priority in offices around the world hoping to achieve similar results.",
		"When children turn four, they start to consider what other people are thinking. If, for instance, you show a four­-year­-old a packet of gum and ask what’s inside, she’ll say, “Gum.” You open the packet and show her that inside there’s a pencil instead of gum. If you ask her what her mother, who’s waiting outside, will think is in the packet once it’s been reclosed, she’ll say, “Gum,” because she knows her mother hasn’t seen the pencil. But children under the age of four will generally say that their mother will think there’s a pencil inside because children of this age cannot yet imagine the world beyond their own reality. They think everyone knows what they know because they cannot model someone else’s mind and, in this case, realize that someone must see something in order to know it.",
		"While a home provides shelter and a place to gather, it is also the safe place where we can express our feelings and enjoy some of the most important and meaningful events in our lives. Therefore, designing a home is a very personal venture. I strongly believe that a home provides a canvas on which we can illustrate who we are; your space should look like you and no one else―even if you are using an interior designer. While some designers love a blank slate and the freedom to do whatever they want, I prefer to work with clients who have an opinion and a story, and I always want the end result to be the best possible version of their taste.",
		"Houses in flames, crops stolen, and hasty graves for the dead. This was the legacy of Attila’s Huns, sweeping across northern Italy and causing massive destruction to the remains of the Roman Empire. But they unintentionally left another, more positive legacy as well. Refugees from burning cities were desperate to find safe refuge. As things got worse, more Roman citizens streamed to the wetlands to avoid the mass killings and destruction on the mainland. Over the next few centuries they transformed the tough surroundings into an architectural wonder: Venice! Built out of misfortune, Venice eventually turned into one of the richest and most beautiful cities in the world. Thus harsh necessity can be the mother of glorious invention.",
		"Some of the most extensive research on the subject of success was conducted by George and Alec Gallup. They interviewed people acknowledged as successful in a wide variety of areas: business, science, literature, education, religion, etc. The goal of the researchers was to determine what these high­-achieving people had in common. There was one thing they all had in common: the willingness to work long, hard hours. All of them agreed that success wasn’t something that had just happened to them due to luck or special talents. It happened because they’d made it happen through continuous effort. Instead of looking for shortcuts and ways to avoid hard work, these people welcomed it as a necessary part of the process.",
		"When you’re eager to get your slice of the pie, why would you be interested in giving a hand to other people so that they can get their piece? If Ernest Hamwi had taken that attitude when he was selling zalabia, a very thin Persian waffle, at the 1904 World’s Fair, he might have ended his days as a street vendor. Hamwi noticed that a nearby ice­cream vendor ran out of bowls to serve to his customers. Most people would have sniffed, “Not my problem,” perhaps even hoping the ice­cream vendor’s misfortune would mean more customers for them. Instead, Hamwi rolled up a waffle and put a scoop of ice cream on top, creating one of the world’s first ice­cream cones. He helped his neighbor and, in the process, made a fortune.",
		"People have changing values depending on the situation. For example, a person might buy a bottle of water, but after reading an article on possible risks of plastic bottles, that same person might avoid an identical bottle of water the next day. When a year later this same person flies to an anti­-plastics conference and crashes in the desert, a plastic bottle of water might suddenly become one of the most valuable things in the universe―to that person, at that time, and in that place. This person shows a preference for one thing over another and demonstrates a ranking and ordering of values with every choice and every action.",
		"In philosophy, the best way to understand the concept of an argument is to contrast it with an opinion. An opinion is simply a belief or attitude about someone or something. We express our opinions all the time: We love or hate certain films or different types of food. For the most part, people’s opinions are based almost always upon their feelings. They don’t feel they have to support their opinions with any kind of evidence. An argument is something a bit different from this. It is made to convince others that one’s claims are true. Thus, it is an attempt to present reasons in support of one’s claims. Arguments are the building blocks of philosophy, and the good philosopher is one who is able to create the best arguments based on a solid foundation.",
		"A study in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology suggests a way to make negotiations go smoother. In this study, when college students who negotiated the purchase of a motorcycle over an online instant messenger believed they were physically far apart (more than 15 miles), negotiations were easier and showed more compromise than when participants believed they were closer (a few feet). The experimenters explain that when people are farther apart, they consider the factors in a more abstract way, focusing on the main issues rather than getting hung up on less important points. So next time you have to work out a complex deal, the researchers say, it may be worthwhile to begin from a distance.",
		"Millions of dollars and thousands of hours are spent each year trying to teach managers how to coach their employees and give them effective feedback. Yet much of this training is ineffective, and many managers remain poor coaches. Is that because this can’t be trained? No, that’s not the reason. Research sheds light on why corporate training often fails. Studies by Peter Hesling and his colleagues show that many managers do not believe in personal change. These managers judge employees as competent or incompetent at the start and that’s that. They do relatively little developmental coaching and when employees do improve, they may fail to take notice, remaining stuck in their initial impression. What’s more, they are far less likely to seek or accept critical feedback from their employees. Why bother to coach employees if they can’t change and why get feedback from them if you can’t change?",
		"Opera singers and dry air don’t get along. In fact, the best professional singers require humid settings to help them achieve the right pitch. If the amount of moisture in the air influences musical pitch, linguist Caleb Everett wondered, has that translated into the development of fewer tonal languages in locations lacking moisture? In tonal languages, such as Mandarin Chinese, the same syllable spoken at a higher pitch can specify a different word if spoken at a lower pitch. In a survey of more than 3,700 languages, he found that those with complex tones do occur less frequently in dry areas than in humid ones. Overall, only one in 30 complex tonal languages flourished in dry areas; one in three non­-tonal languages appeared in those same regions. Those conclusions go against a linguistic view that the structure of language is independent of its environment.",
		"We become more successful when we are happier and more positive. For example, doctors put in a positive mood before making a diagnosis show almost three times more intelligence and creativity than doctors in a neutral state, and they make accurate diagnoses 19 percent faster. Salespeople who are optimistic sell more than those who are pessimistic by 56 percent. Students who are made to feel happy before taking math achievement tests perform much better than their neutral peers. It turns out that our brains are literally programmed to perform at their best not when they are negative or even neutral, but when they are positive.",
		"Questions convey interest, but sometimes the interest they convey is not closely related to what the person is trying to say. Sometimes the distraction is obvious. If you’re telling a friend all the unpleasant things you experienced on your vacation, and she interrupts with a lot of questions about where you stayed, you won’t feel listened to. At other times people seem to be following but can’t help trying to lead. These listeners force their own narrative structures on our experience. Their questions assume that our stories should fit their scripts: “Problems should be denied or made to go away”; “Everyone should be together”; “Bullies must be confronted.” By finishing our sentences, pumping us with questions, and otherwise pushing us to say what they want to hear, controlling listeners violate our right to tell our own stories.",
		"About four billion years ago, molecules joined together to form cells. About two billion years later, cells joined together to form more complex cells. And then a billion years later, these more complex cells joined together to form multicellular organisms. All of these evolved because the participating individuals could, by working together, spread their genetic material in new and more effective ways. Fast­-forward another billion years to our world, which is full of social animals, from ants to wolves to humans. The same principle applies. Ants and wolves in groups can do things that no single ant or wolf can do, and we humans, by cooperating with one another, have become the earth’s dominant species.",
		"What do advertising and map­making have in common? Without doubt the best answer is their shared need to communicate a limited version of the truth. An advertisement must create an image that’s appealing and a map must present an image that’s clear, but neither can meet its goal by telling or showing everything. Ads will cover up or play down negative aspects of the company or service they advertise. In this way, they can promote a favorable comparison with similar products or differentiate a product from its competitors. Likewise, the map must remove details that would be confusing.",
		"Did you know you actually think in images and not in words? Images are simply mental pictures showing ideas and experiences. Early humans communicated their ideas and experiences to others for thousands of years by drawing pictures in the sand or on the walls of their caves. Only recently have humans created various languages and alphabets to symbolize these “picture” messages. Your mind has not yet adapted to this relatively new development. An image has a much greater impact on your brain than words; the nerves from the eye to the brain are twenty­-five times larger than the nerves from the ear to the brain. You often remember a person’s face but not his or her name, for example. The old saying, “A picture is worth a thousand words,” is true.",
		"In 1995, a group of high school students in Miner County, South Dakota, started planning a revival. They wanted to do something that might revive their dying community. Miner County had been failing for decades. Farm and industrial jobs had slowly dried up, and nothing had replaced them. The students started investigating the situation. One finding in particular disturbed them. They discovered that half of the residents had been shopping outside the county, driving an hour to Sioux Falls to shop in larger stores. Most of the things that could improve the situation were out of the students’ control. But they did uncover one thing that was very much in their control: inviting the residents to spend money locally. They found their first slogan: Let’s keep Miner dollars in Miner County.",
		"What do rural Africans think as they pass fields of cash crops such as sunflowers, roses, or coffee, while walking five kilometers a day to collect water? Some African countries find it difficult to feed their own people or provide safe drinking water, yet precious water is used to produce export crops for European markets. But, African farmers cannot help but grow those crops because they are one of only a few sources of income for them. In a sense, African countries are exporting their water in the very crops they grow. They need water, but they also need to export water through the crops they produce. Environmental pressure groups argue that European customers who buy African coffee or flowers are making water shortages worse in Africa.",
		"One real concern in the marketing industry today is how to win the battle for broadcast advertising exposure in the age of the remote control and mobile devices. With the growing popularity of digital video recorders, consumers can mute, fast-forward, and skip over commercials entirely. Some advertisers are trying to adapt to these technologies, by planting hidden coupons in frames of their television commercials. Others are desperately trying to make their advertisements more interesting and entertaining to discourage viewers from skipping their ads; still others are simply giving up on television advertising altogether. Some industry experts predict that cable providers and advertisers will eventually be forced to provide incentives in order to encourage consumers to watch their messages. These incentives may come in the form of coupons, or a reduction in the cable bill for each advertisement watched.",
		"It’s hard enough to stick with goals you want to accomplish, but sometimes we make goals we’re not even thrilled about in the first place. We set resolutions based on what we’re supposed to do, or what others think we’re supposed to do, rather than what really matters to us. This makes it nearly impossible to stick to the goal. For example, reading more is a good habit, but if you’re only doing it because you feel like that’s what you’re supposed to do, not because you actually want to learn more, you’re going to have a hard time reaching the goal. Instead, make goals based on your own values. Now, this isn’t to say you should read less. The idea is to first consider what matters to you, then figure out what you need to do to get there.",
		"Houston Airport executives faced plenty of complaints regarding baggage claim time, so they increased the number of baggage handlers. Although it reduced the average wait time to eight minutes, complaints didn’t stop. It took about a minute to get from the arrival gate to baggage claim, so the passengers spent seven more minutes waiting for their bags. The solution was to move the arrival gates away from the baggage claim so it took passengers about seven minutes to walk there. It resulted in complaints reducing to almost zero. Research shows occupied time feels shorter than unoccupied time. People usually exaggerate about the time they waited, and what they find most bothersome is time spent unoccupied. Thus, occupying the passengers’ time by making them walk longer gave them the idea they didn’t have to wait as long.",
		"Having extremely vivid memories of past emotional experiences and only weak memories of past everyday events means we maintain a biased perception of the past. We tend to view the past as a concentrated time line of emotionally exciting events. We remember the arousing aspects of an episode and forget the boring bits. A summer vacation will be recalled for its highlights, and the less exciting parts will fade away with time, eventually to be forgotten forever. As a result, when we estimate how our next summer vacation will make us feel, we overestimate the positive. It seems as though an imprecise picture of the past is one reason for our inaccurate forecasts of the future.",
		"Within a store, the wall marks the back of the store, but not the end of the marketing. Merchandisers often use the back wall as a magnet, because it means that people have to walk through the whole store. This is a good thing because distance traveled relates more directly to sales per entering customer than any other measurable consumer variable. Sometimes, the wall’s attraction is simply appealing to the senses, a wall decoration that catches the eye or a sound that catches the ear. Sometimes the attraction is specific goods. In supermarkets, the dairy is often at the back, because people frequently come just for milk. At video rental shops, it’s the new releases.",
		"The good news is, where you end up ten years from now is up to you. You are free to choose what you want to make of your life. It’s called free will and it’s your basic right. What’s more, you can turn it on instantly! At any moment, you can choose to start showing more respect for yourself or stop hanging out with friends who bring you down. After all, you choose to be happy or miserable. The reality is that although you are free to choose, you can’t choose the consequences of your choices. It’s a package deal. As the old saying goes, “If you pick up one end of the stick, you pick up the other.” Choice and consequence go together like mashed potatoes and gravy.",
		"Just think for a moment of all the people upon whom your participation in your class depends. Clearly, the class requires a teacher to teach it and students to take it. However, it also depends on many other people and organizations. Someone had to decide when the class would be held and in what room, communicate that information to you, and enroll you in that class. Someone also had to write a textbook, and with the assistance of many other people— printers, editors, salespeople, and bookstore employees—it has arrived in your hands. Thus, a class that seems to involve just you, your fellow students, and your teacher is in fact the product of the efforts of hundreds of people.",
		"One outcome of motivation is behavior that takes considerable effort. For example, if you are motivated to buy a good car, you will research vehicles online, look at ads, visit dealerships, and so on. Likewise, if you are motivated to lose weight, you will buy low­-fat foods, eat smaller portions, and exercise. Motivation not only drives the final behaviors that bring a goal closer but also creates willingness to expend time and energy on preparatory behaviors. Thus, someone motivated to buy a new smartphone may earn extra money for it, drive through a storm to reach the store, and then wait in line to buy it.",
		"Good managers have learned to overcome the initial feelings of anxiety when assigning tasks. They are aware that no two people act in exactly the same way and so do not feel threatened if they see one employee going about a task differently than another. Instead, they focus on the end result. If a job was successfully done, as long as people are working in a manner acceptable to the organization (for example, as long as salespeople are keeping to the company’s ethical selling policy), then that’s fine. If an acceptable final outcome wasn’t achieved, then such managers respond by discussing it with the employee and analyzing the situation, to find out what training or additional skills that person will need to do the task successfully in the future.",
		"There is good evidence that in organic development, perception starts with recognizing outstanding structural features. For example, when two­-year­-old children and chimpanzees had learned that, of two boxes presented to them, the one with a triangle of a particular size and shape always contained attractive food, they had no difficulty applying their training to triangles of very different appearance. The triangles were made smaller or larger or turned upside down. A black triangle on a white background was replaced by a white triangle on a black background, or an outlined triangle by a solid one. These changes seemed not to interfere with recognition. Similar results were obtained with rats. Karl Lashley, a psychologist, has asserted that simple transpositions of this type are universal in all animals including humans.",
		"There is a very old story involving a man trying to fix his broken boiler. Despite his best efforts over many months, he can’t do it. Eventually, he gives up and decides to call in an expert. The engineer arrives, gives one gentle tap on the side of the boiler, and it springs to life. The engineer gives a bill to the man, and the man argues that he should pay only a small fee as the job took the engineer only a few moments. The engineer explains that the man is not paying for the time he took to tap the boiler but rather the years of experience involved in knowing exactly where to tap. Just like the expert engineer tapping the boiler, effective change does not have to be time­consuming. In fact, it is often simply a question of knowing exactly where to tap.",
		"One CEO in one of Silicon Valley’s most innovative companies has what would seem like a boring, creativity­-killing routine. He holds a three­-hour meeting that starts at 9:00 A.M. one day a week. It is never missed or rescheduled at a different time. It is mandatory―so much so that even in this global firm all the executives know never to schedule any travel that will conflict with the meeting. At first glance there is nothing particularly unique about this. But what is unique is the quality of ideas that come out of the regular meetings. Because the CEO has eliminated the mental cost involved in planning the meeting or thinking about who will or won’t be there, people can focus on creative problem solving.",
		"When meeting someone in person, body language experts say that smiling can portray confidence and warmth. Online, however, smiley faces could be doing some serious damage to your career. In a new study, researchers found that using smiley faces makes you look incompetent. The study says, “contrary to actual smiles, smileys do not increase perceptions of warmth and actually decrease perceptions of competence.” The report also explains, “Perceptions of low competence, in turn, lessened information sharing.” Chances are, if you are including a smiley face in an email for work, the last thing you want is for your co­workers to think that you are so inadequate that they chose not to share information with you.",
		"How funny are you? While some people are natural humorists, being funny is a set of skills that can be learned. Exceptionally funny people don’t depend upon their memory to keep track of everything they find funny. In the olden days, great comedians carried notebooks to write down funny thoughts or observations and scrapbooks for news clippings that struck them as funny. Today, you can do that easily with your smartphone. If you have a funny thought, record it as an audio note. If you read a funny article, save the link in your bookmarks. The world is a funny place and your existence within it is probably funnier. Accepting that fact is a blessing that gives you everything you need to see humor and craft stories on a daily basis. All you have to do is document them and then tell someone.",
		"If you ask a physicist how long it would take a marble to fall from the top of a ten­story building, he will likely answer the question by assuming that the marble falls in a vacuum. In reality, the building is surrounded by air, which applies friction to the falling marble and slows it down. Yet the physicist will point out that the friction on the marble is so small that its effect is negligible. Assuming the marble falls in a vacuum simplifies the problem without substantially affecting the answer. Economists make assumptions for the same reason: Assumptions can simplify the complex world and make it easier to understand. To study the effects of international trade, for example, we might assume that the world consists of only two countries and that each country produces only two goods. By doing so, we can focus our thinking on the essence of the problem. Thus, we are in a better position to understand international trade in the complex world.",
		"We have to recognize that there always exists in us the strongest need to utilize all our attention. And this is quite evident in the great amount of displeasure we feel any time the entirety of our capacity for attention is not being put to use. When this is the case, we will seek to find outlets for our unused attention. If we are playing a chess game with a weaker opponent, we will seek to supplement this activity with another: such as watching TV, or listening to music, or playing another chess game at the same time. Very often this reveals itself in unconscious movements, such as playing with something in one’s hands or pacing around the room; and if such an action also serves to increase pleasure or relieve displeasure, all the better.",
		"From an economic perspective, a short-lived event can become an innovative event if it generates goods and services that can be sold to people, in particular to those from outside the locality. The remarkable growth of art exhibitions, cultural festivals and sports competitions, for example, can be analysed in this light. They are temporary activities that can attract large numbers of outsiders to a locality, bringing in new sources of income. But even here, there is a two-way interaction between the event and the context. The existence of an infrastructure, a reputation, a history of an activity for an area may have important effects on the economic success or failure of an event. In other words, events do not take place in a vacuum. They depend on an existing context which has been in the making for a long time. The short-lived event, therefore, would be performed in relation to this long-term context.",
		"Interestingly, in nature, the more powerful species have a narrower field of vision. The distinction between predator and prey offers a clarifying example of this. The key feature that distinguishes predator species from prey species isn’t the presence of claws or any other feature related to biological weaponry. The key feature is the position of their eyes. Predators evolved with eyes facing forward―which allows for binocular vision that offers accurate depth perception when pursuing prey. Prey, on the other hand, often have eyes facing outward, maximizing peripheral vision, which allows the hunted to detect danger that may be approaching from any angle. Consistent with our place at the top of the food chain, humans have eyes that face forward. We have the ability to gauge depth and pursue our goals, but we can also miss important action on our periphery.",
		"All mammals need to leave their parents and set up on their own at some point. But human adults generally provide a comfortable existence―enough food arrives on the table, money is given at regular intervals, the bills get paid and the electricity for the TV doesn’t usually run out. If teenagers didn’t build up a fairly major disrespect for and conflict with their parents or carers, they’d never want to leave. In fact, falling out of love with the adults who look after you is probably a necessary part of growing up. Later, when you live independently, away from them, you can start to love them again because you won’t need to be fighting to get away from them. And you can come back sometimes for a home­cooked meal.",
		"A lovely technique for helping children take the first steps towards creating their own, unique story, is to ask them to help you complete a story before you tell it. One story I have done this with frequently is a tale I call Benno and the Beasts. It is based on a story called St. Benno and the Frog, found in an old book by Helen Waddell. In the original, the saint meets a frog in a marsh and tells it to be quiet in case it disturbs his prayers. Later, he regrets this, in case God was enjoying listening to the sound of the frog. I invite children to think of different animals for the saint to meet and different places for him to meet them. I then tell them the story including their own ideas. It is a most effective way of involving children in the art of creating stories and they love hearing their ideas used.",
		"It is difficult to know how to determine whether one culture is better than another. What is the cultural rank order of rock, jazz, and classical music? When it comes to public opinion polls about whether cultural changes are for the better or the worse, looking forward would lead to one answer and looking backward would lead to a very different answer. Our children would be horrified if they were told they had to go back to the culture of their grandparents. Our parents would be horrified if they were told they had to participate in the culture of their grandchildren. Humans tend to like what they have grown up in and gotten used to. After a certain age, anxieties arise when sudden cultural changes are coming. Our culture is part of who we are and where we stand, and we don’t like to think that who we are and where we stand are short­-lived.",
		"There is a major problem with counting from 0. To determine the number of objects by counting, such as determining how many apples there are on a table, many children would touch or point to the first apple and say “one,” then move on to the second apple and say “two,” and continue in this manner until all the apples are counted. If we start at 0, we would have to touch nothing and say “zero,” but then we would have to start touching apples and calling out “one, two, three” and so on. This can be very confusing because there would be a need to stress when to touch and when not to touch. If a child accidentally touches an apple while saying “zero,” then the total number of apples will be off by 1.",
		"The mind is essentially a survival machine. Attack and defense against other minds, gathering, storing, and analyzing information―this is what it is good at, but it is not at all creative. All true artists create from a place of no­mind, from inner stillness. Even great scientists have reported that their creative breakthroughs came at a time of mental quietude. The surprising result of a nationwide inquiry among America’s most famous mathematicians, including Einstein, to find out their working methods, was that thinking “plays only a subordinate part in the brief, decisive phase of the creative act itself.” So I would say that the simple reason why the majority of scientists are not creative is not because they don’t know how to think, but because they don’t know how to stop thinking!",
		"We are more likely to eat in a restaurant if we know that it is usually busy. Even when nobody tells us a restaurant is good, our herd behavior determines our decision­-making. Let’s suppose you walk toward two empty restaurants. You do not know which one to enter. However, you suddenly see a group of six people enter one of them. Which one are you more likely to enter, the empty one or the other one? Most people would go into the restaurant with people in it. Let’s suppose you and a friend go into that restaurant. Now, it has eight people in it. Others see that one restaurant is empty and the other has eight people in it. So, they decide to do the same as the other eight.",
		"In an experiment, researchers presented participants with two photos of faces and asked participants to choose the photo that they thought was more attractive, and then handed participants that photo. Using a clever trick inspired by stage magic, when participants received the photo, it had been switched to the photo not chosen by the participant― the less attractive photo. Remarkably, most participants accepted this photo as their own choice and then proceeded to give arguments for why they had chosen that face in the first place. This revealed a striking mismatch between our choices and our ability to rationalize outcomes. This same finding has since been observed in various domains including taste for jam and financial decisions.",
		"All improvement in your life begins with an improvement in your mental pictures. If you talk to unhappy people and ask them what they think about most of the time, you will find that almost without fail, they think about their problems, their bills, their negative relationships, and all the difficulties in their lives. But when you talk to successful, happy people, you find that they think and talk most of the time about the things that they want to be, do, and have. They think and talk about the specific action steps they can take to get them. They dwell continually on vivid, exciting pictures of what their goals will look like when they are realized, and what their dreams will look like when they come true.",
		"Vision is like shooting at a moving target. Plenty of things can go wrong in the future and plenty more can change in unpredictable ways. When such things happen, you should be prepared to make your vision conform to the new reality. For example, a businessman’s optimistic forecast can be blown away by a cruel recession or by aggressive competition in ways he could not have foreseen. Or in another scenario, his sales can skyrocket and his numbers can get even better. In any event, he will be foolish to stick to his old vision in the face of new data. There is nothing wrong in modifying your vision or even abandoning it, as necessary.",
		"The title of Thomas Friedman’s 2005 book, The World Is Flat, was based on the belief that globalization would inevitably bring us closer together. It has done that, but it has also inspired us to build barriers. When faced with perceived threats―the financial crisis, terrorism, violent conflict, refugees and immigration, the increasing gap between rich and poor―people cling more tightly to their groups. One founder of a famous social media company believed social media would unite us. In some respects it has, but it has simultaneously given voice and organizational ability to new cyber tribes, some of whom spend their time spreading blame and division across the World Wide Web. There seem now to be as many tribes, and as much conflict between them, as there have ever been. Is it possible for these tribes to coexist in a world where the concept of “us and them” remains?",
		"Focusing on the differences among societies conceals a deeper reality: their similarities are greater and more profound than their dissimilarities. Imagine studying two hills while standing on a ten-thousand-foot-high plateau. Seen from your perspective, one hill appears to be three hundred feet high, and the other appears to be nine hundred feet. This difference may seem large, and you might focus your attention on what local forces, such as erosion, account for the difference in size. But this narrow perspective misses the opportunity to study the other, more significant geological forces that created what are actually two very similar mountains, one 10,300 feet high and the other 10,900 feet. And when it comes to human societies, people have been standing on a ten-thousand-foot plateau, letting the differences among societies mask the more overwhelming similarities.",
		"There is a famous Spanish proverb that says, “The belly rules the mind.” This is a clinically proven fact. Food is the original mind-controlling drug. Every time we eat, we bombard our brains with a feast of chemicals, triggering an explosive hormonal chain reaction that directly influences the way we think. Countless studies have shown that the positive emotional state induced by a good meal enhances our receptiveness to be persuaded. It triggers an instinctive desire to repay the provider. This is why executives regularly combine business meetings with meals, why lobbyists invite politicians to attend receptions, lunches, and dinners, and why major state occasions almost always involve an impressive banquet. Churchill called this “dining diplomacy,” and sociologists have confirmed that this principle is a strong motivator across all human cultures.",
		"Although many small businesses have excellent websites, they typically can’t afford aggressive online campaigns. One way to get the word out is through an advertising exchange, in which advertisers place banners on each other’s websites for free. For example, a company selling beauty products could place its banner on a site that sells women’s shoes, and in turn, the shoe company could put a banner on the beauty product site. Neither company charges the other; they simply exchange ad space. Advertising exchanges are gaining in popularity, especially among marketers who do not have much money and who don’t have a large sales team. By trading space, advertisers find new outlets that reach their target audiences that they would not otherwise be able to afford.",
		"Motivation may come from several sources. It may be the respect I give every student, the daily greeting I give at my classroom door, the undivided attention when I listen to a student, a pat on the shoulder whether the job was done well or not, an accepting smile, or simply “I love you” when it is most needed. It may simply be asking how things are at home. For one student considering dropping out of school, it was a note from me after one of his frequent absences saying that he made my day when I saw him in school. He came to me with the note with tears in his eyes and thanked me. He will graduate this year. Whatever technique is used, the students must know that you care about them. But the concern must be genuine—the students can’t be fooled.",
		"Say you normally go to a park to walk or work out. Maybe today you should choose a different park. Why? Well, who knows? Maybe it’s because you need the connection to the different energy in the other park. Maybe you’ll run into people there that you’ve never met before. You could make a new best friend simply by visiting a different park. You never know what great things will happen to you until you step outside the zone where you feel comfortable. If you’re staying in your comfort zone and you’re not pushing yourself past that same old energy, then you’re not going to move forward on your path. By forcing yourself to do something different, you’re awakening yourself on a spiritual level and you’re forcing yourself to do something that will benefit you in the long run. As they say, variety is the spice of life.",
		"Humans are champion long‒distance runners. As soon as a person and a chimp start running they both get hot. Chimps quickly overheat; humans do not, because they are much better at shedding body heat. According to one leading theory, ancestral humans lost their hair over successive generations because less hair meant cooler, more effective long‒distance running. That ability let our ancestors outmaneuver and outrun prey. Try wearing a couple of extra jackets—or better yet, fur coats—on a hot humid day and run a mile. Now, take those jackets off and try it again. You’ll see what a difference a lack of fur makes.",
		"Recently I was with a client who had spent almost five hours with me. As we were parting for the evening, we reflected on what we had covered that day. Even though our conversation was very collegial, I noticed that my client was holding one leg at a right angle to his body, seemingly wanting to take off on its own. At that point I said, “You really do have to leave now, don’t you?” “Yes,” he admitted. “I am so sorry. I didn’t want to be rude but I have to call London and I only have five minutes!” Here was a case where my client’s language and most of his body revealed nothing but positive feelings. His feet, however, were the most honest communicators, and they clearly told me that as much as he wanted to stay, duty was calling.",
		"One of the main reasons that students may think they know the material, even when they don’t, is that they mistake familiarity for understanding. Here is how it works: You read the chapter once, perhaps highlighting as you go. Then later, you read the chapter again, perhaps focusing on the highlighted material. As you read it over, the material is familiar because you remember it from before, and this familiarity might lead you to think, “Okay, I know that.” The problem is that this feeling of familiarity is not necessarily equivalent to knowing the material and may be of no help when you have to come up with an answer on the exam. In fact, familiarity can often lead to errors on multiple‒choice exams because you might pick a choice that looks familiar, only to find later that it was something you had read, but it wasn’t really the best answer to the question.",
		"Here’s the unpleasant truth: we are all biased. Every human being is affected by unconscious biases that lead us to make incorrect assumptions about other people. Everyone. To a certain extent, bias is a(n) necessary survival skill. If you’re an early human, perhaps Homo Erectus, walking around the jungles, you may see an animal approaching. You have to make very fast assumptions about whether that animal is safe or not, based solely on its appearance. The same is true of other humans. You make split­-second decisions about threats in order to have plenty of time to escape, if necessary. This could be one root of our tendency to categorize and label others based on their looks and their clothes.",
		"In Dutch bicycle culture, it is common to have a passenger on the backseat. So as to follow the rider’s movements, the person on the backseat needs to hold on tightly. Bicycles turn not just by steering but also by leaning, so the passenger needs to lean the same way as the rider. A passenger who would keep sitting up straight would literally be a pain in the behind. On motorcycles, this is even more critical. Their higher speed requires more leaning on turns, and lack of coordination can be disastrous. The passenger is a true partner in the ride, expected to mirror the rider’s every move.",
		"We’re often told that newborns and infants are comforted by rocking because this motion is similar to what they experienced in the womb, and that they must take comfort in this familiar feeling. This may be true; however, to date there are no convincing data that demonstrate a significant relationship between the amount of time a mother moves during pregnancy and her newborn’s response to rocking. Just as likely is the idea that newborns come to associate gentle rocking with being fed. Parents understand that rocking quiets a newborn, and they very often provide gentle, repetitive movement during feeding. Since the appearance of food is a primary reinforcer, newborns may acquire a fondness for motion because they have been conditioned through a process of associative learning.",
		"Business consultant Frans Johansson describes the Medici effect as the emergence of new ideas and creative solutions when different backgrounds and disciplines come together. The term is derived from the 15th-century Medici family, who helped usher in the Renaissance by bringing together artists, writers, and other creatives from all over the world. Arguably, the Renaissance was a result of the exchange of ideas between these different groups in close contact with each other. Sound familiar? If you are unable to diversify your own talent and skill, then having others around you to compensate might very well just do the trick. Believing that all new ideas come from combining existing notions in creative ways, Johansson recommends utilizing a mix of backgrounds, experiences, and expertise in staffing to bring about the best possible solutions, perspectives, and innovations in business.",
		"As much as we can learn by examining fossils, it is important to remember that they seldom tell the entire story. Things only fossilize under certain sets of conditions. Modern insect communities are highly diverse in tropical forests, but the recent fossil record captures little of that diversity. Many creatures are consumed entirely or decompose rapidly when they die, so there may be no fossil record at all for important groups. It’s a bit similar to a family photo album. Maybe when you were born your parents took lots of pictures, but over the years they took photographs occasionally, and sometimes they got busy and forgot to take pictures at all. Very few of us have a complete photo record of our life. Fossils are just like that. Sometimes you get very clear pictures of the past, while at other times there are big gaps, and you need to notice what they are.",
		"Back in 1996, an American airline was faced with an interesting problem. At a time when most other airlines were losing money or going under, over 100 cities were begging the company to service their locations. However, that’s not the interesting part. What’s interesting is that the company turned down over 95 percent of those offers and began serving only four new locations. It turned down tremendous growth because company leadership had set an upper limit for growth. Sure, its executives wanted to grow each year, but they didn’t want to grow too much. Unlike other famous companies, they wanted to set their own pace, one that could be sustained in the long term. By doing this, they established a safety margin for growth that helped them continue to thrive at a time when the other airlines were flailing.",
		"One of the most important aspects of providing good care is making sure that an animal’s needs are being met consistently and predictably. Like humans, animals need a sense of control. So an animal who may get enough food but doesn’t know when the food will appear and can see no consistent schedule may experience distress. We can provide a sense of control by ensuring that our animal’s environment is predictable: there is always water available and always in the same place. There is always food when we get up in the morning and after our evening walk. There will always be a time and place to eliminate, without having to hold things in to the point of discomfort. Human companions can display consistent emotional support, rather than providing love one moment and withholding love the next. When animals know what to expect, they can feel more confident and calm.",
		"When a child is upset, the easiest and quickest way to calm them down is to give them food. This acts as a distraction from the feelings they are having, gives them something to do with their hands and mouth and shifts their attention from whatever was upsetting them. If the food chosen is also seen as a treat such as sweets or a biscuit, then the child will feel ‘treated’ and happier. In the shorter term using food like this is effective. But in the longer term it can be harmful as we quickly learn that food is a good way to manage emotions. Then as we go through life, whenever we feel annoyed, anxious or even just bored, we turn to food to make ourselves feel better.",
		"Scientists believe that the frogs’ ancestors were water­-dwelling, fishlike animals. The first frogs and their relatives gained the ability to come out on land and enjoy the opportunities for food and shelter there. But they still kept many ties to the water. A frog’s lungs do not work very well, and it gets part of its oxygen by breathing through its skin. But for this kind of “breathing” to work properly, the frog’s skin must stay moist. And so the frog must remain near the water where it can take a dip every now and then to keep from drying out. Frogs must also lay their eggs in water, as their fishlike ancestors did. And eggs laid in the water must develop into water creatures, if they are to survive. For frogs, metamorphosis thus provides the bridge between the water­-dwelling young forms and the land­-dwelling adults.",
		"It is important to distinguish between being legally allowed to do something, and actually being able to go and do it. A law could be passed allowing everyone, if they so wish, to run a mile in two minutes. That would not, however, increase their effective freedom, because, although allowed to do so, they are physically incapable of it. Having a minimum of restrictions and a maximum of possibilities is fine. But in the real world most people will never have the opportunity either to become all that they are allowed to become, or to need to be restrained from doing everything that is possible for them to do. Their effective freedom depends on actually having the means and ability to do what they choose.",
		"Research has confirmed that athletes are less likely to participate in unacceptable behavior than are non­-athletes. However, moral reasoning and good sporting behavior seem to decline as athletes progress to higher competitive levels, in part because of the increased emphasis on winning. Thus winning can be a double­-edged sword in teaching character development. Some athletes may want to win so much that they lie, cheat, and break team rules. They may develop undesirable character traits that can enhance their ability to win in the short term. However, when athletes resist the temptation to win in a dishonest way, they can develop positive character traits that last a lifetime. Character is a learned behavior, and a sense of fair play develops only if coaches plan to teach those lessons systematically.",
		"Due to technological innovations, music can now be experienced by more people, for more of the time than ever before. Mass availability has given individuals unheard­-of control over their own sound­-environment. However, it has also confronted them with the simultaneous availability of countless genres of music, in which they have to orient themselves. People start filtering out and organizing their digital libraries like they used to do with their physical music collections. However, there is the difference that the choice lies in their own hands. Without being restricted to the limited collection of music­-distributors, nor being guided by the local radio program as a ‘preselector’ of the latest hits, the individual actively has to choose and determine his or her musical preferences. The search for the right song is thus associated with considerable effort.",
		"It is common to assume that creativity concerns primarily the relation between actor(creator) and artifact(creation). However, from a sociocultural standpoint, the creative act is never “complete” in the absence of a second position―that of an audience. While the actor or creator him/herself is the first audience of the artifact being produced, this kind of distantiation can only be achieved by internalizing the perspective of others on one’s work. This means that, in order to be an audience to your own creation, a history of interaction with others is needed. We exist in a social world that constantly confronts us with the “view of the other.” It is the view we include and blend into our own activity, including creative activity. This outside perspective is essential for creativity because it gives new meaning and value to the creative act and its product.",
		"Many evolutionary biologists argue that humans developed language for economic reasons. We needed to trade, and we needed to establish trust in order to trade. Language is very handy when you are trying to conduct business with someone. Two early humans could not only agree to trade three wooden bowls for six bunches of bananas but establish rules as well. What wood was used for the bowls? Where did you get the bananas? That business deal would have been nearly impossible using only gestures and confusing noises, and carrying it out according to terms agreed upon creates a bond of trust. Language allows us to be specific, and this is where conversation plays a key role.",
		"One big difference between science and stage magic is that while magicians hide their mistakes from the audience, in science you make your mistakes in public. You show them off so that everybody can learn from them. This way, you get the advantage of everybody else’s experience, and not just your own idiosyncratic path through the space of mistakes. This, by the way, is another reason why we humans are so much smarter than every other species. It is not that our brains are bigger or more powerful, or even that we have the ability to reflect on our own past errors, but that we share the benefits that our individual brains have earned from their individual histories of trial and error.",
		"The last two decades of research on the science of learning have shown conclusively that we remember things better, and longer, if we discover them ourselves rather than being told them. This is the teaching method practiced by physics professor Eric Mazur. He doesn’t lecture in his classes at Harvard. Instead, he asks students difficult questions, based on their homework reading, that require them to pull together sources of information to solve a problem. Mazur doesn’t give them the answer; instead, he asks the students to break off into small groups and discuss the problem among themselves. Eventually, nearly everyone in the class gets the answer right, and the concepts stick with them because they had to find their own way to the answer.",
		"Not only does memory underlie our ability to think at all, it defines the content of our experiences and how we preserve them for years to come. Memory makes us who we are. If I were to suffer from heart failure and depend upon an artificial heart, I would be no less myself. If I lost an arm in an accident and had it replaced with an artificial arm, I would still be essentially me. As long as my mind and memories remain intact, I will continue to be the same person, no matter which part of my body (other than the brain) is replaced. On the other hand, when someone suffers from advanced Alzheimer’s disease and his memories fade, people often say that he “is not himself anymore,” or that it is as if the person “is no longer there,” though his body remains unchanged.",
		"Over time, babies construct expectations about what sounds they will hear when. They hold in memory the sound patterns that occur on a regular basis. They make hypotheses like, “If I hear this sound first, it probably will be followed by that sound.” Scientists conclude that much of babies’ skill in learning language is due to their ability to calculate statistics. For babies, this means that they appear to pay close attention to the patterns that repeat in language. They remember, in a systematic way, how often sounds occur, in what order, with what intervals, and with what changes of pitch. This memory store allows them to track, within the neural circuits of their brains, the frequency of sound patterns and to use this knowledge to make predictions about the meaning in patterns of sounds.",
		"Some deep-sea organisms are known to use bioluminescence as a lure, to attract prey with a little glow imitating the movements of their favorite fish, or like fireflies, as a sexual attractant to find mates. While there are many possible evolutionary theories for the survival value of bioluminescence, one of the most fascinating is to create a cloak of invisibility. The color of almost all bioluminescent molecules is blue-green, the same color as the ocean above. By self-glowing blue-green, the creatures no longer cast a shadow or create a silhouette, especially when viewed from below against the brighter waters above. Rather, by glowing themselves, they can blend into the sparkles, reflections, and scattered blue-green glow of sunlight or moonlight. Thus, they are most likely making their own light not to see, but to be un-seen.",
		"Face­-to­-face interaction is a uniquely powerful―and sometimes the only―way to share many kinds of knowledge, from the simplest to the most complex. It is one of the best ways to stimulate new thinking and ideas, too. Most of us would have had difficulty learning how to tie a shoelace only from pictures, or how to do arithmetic from a book. Psychologist Mihàly Csikszentmihàlyi found, while studying high achievers, that a large number of Nobel Prize winners were the students of previous winners: they had access to the same literature as everyone else, but personal contact made a crucial difference to their creativity. Within organisations this makes conversation both a crucial factor for high­-level professional skills and the most important way of sharing everyday information.",
		"Most times a foreign language is spoken in film, subtitles are used to translate the dialogue for the viewer. However, there are occasions when foreign dialogue is left unsubtitled (and thus incomprehensible to most of the target audience). This is often done if the movie is seen mainly from the viewpoint of a particular character who does not speak the language. Such absence of subtitles allows the audience to feel a similar sense of incomprehension and alienation that the character feels. An example of this is seen in Not Without My Daughter. The Persian language dialogue spoken by the Iranian characters is not subtitled because the main character Betty Mahmoody does not speak Persian and the audience is seeing the film from her viewpoint.",
		"One dynamic that can change dramatically in sport is the concept of the home­-field advantage, in which perceived demands and resources seem to play a role. Under normal circumstances, the home ground would appear to provide greater perceived resources (fans, home field, and so on). However, researchers Roy Baumeister and Andrew Steinhilber were among the first to point out that these competitive factors can change; for example, the success percentage for home teams in the final games of a playoff or World Series seems to drop. Fans can become part of the perceived demands rather than resources under those circumstances. This change in perception can also explain why a team that’s struggling at the start of the year will often welcome a road trip to reduce perceived demands and pressures.",
		"The law of demand is that the demand for goods and services increases as prices fall, and the demand falls as prices increase. Giffen goods are special types of products for which the traditional law of demand does not apply. Instead of switching to cheaper replacements, consumers demand more of giffen goods when the price increases and less of them when the price decreases. Taking an example, rice in China is a giffen good because people tend to purchase less of it when the price falls. The reason for this is, when the price of rice falls, people have more money to spend on other types of products such as meat and dairy and, therefore, change their spending pattern. On the other hand, as rice prices increase, people consume more rice.",
		"In a study at Princeton University in 1992, research scientists looked at two different groups of mice. One group was made intellectually superior by modifying the gene for the glutamate receptor. Glutamate is a brain chemical that is necessary in learning. The other group was genetically manipulated to be intellectually inferior, also done by modifying the gene for the glutamate receptor. The smart mice were then raised in standard cages, while the inferior mice were raised in large cages with toys and exercise wheels and with lots of social interaction. At the end of the study, although the intellectually inferior mice were genetically handicapped, they were able to perform just as well as their genetic superiors. This was a real triumph for nurture over nature. Genes are turned on or off based on what is around you.",
		"Researchers are working on a project that asks coastal towns how they are preparing for rising sea levels. Some towns have risk assessments; some towns even have a plan. But it’s a rare town that is actually carrying out a plan. One reason we’ve failed to act on climate change is the common belief that it is far away in time and space. For decades, climate change was a prediction about the future, so scientists talked about it in the future tense. This became a habit―so that even today many scientists still use the future tense, even though we know that a climate crisis is ongoing. Scientists also often focus on regions most affected by the crisis, such as Bangladesh or the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which for most Americans are physically remote.",
		"The prevailing view among developmental scientists is that people are active contributors to their own development. People are influenced by the physical and social contexts in which they live, but they also play a role in influencing their development by interacting with, and changing, those contexts. Even infants influence the world around them and construct their own development through their interactions. Consider an infant who smiles at each adult he sees; he influences his world because adults are likely to smile, use “baby talk,” and play with him in response. The infant brings adults into close contact, making one­-on­-one interactions and creating opportunities for learning. By engaging the world around them, thinking, being curious, and interacting with people, objects, and the world around them, individuals of all ages are “manufacturers of their own development.”",
		"The demand for freshness can have hidden environmental costs. While freshness is now being used as a term in food marketing as part of a return to nature, the demand for year­-round supplies of fresh produce such as soft fruit and exotic vegetables has led to the widespread use of hot houses in cold climates and increasing reliance on total quality control―management by temperature control, use of pesticides and computer/satellite­-based logistics. The demand for freshness has also contributed to concerns about food wastage. Use of ‘best before’, ‘sell by’ and ‘eat by’ labels has legally allowed institutional waste. Campaigners have exposed the scandal of over­production and waste. Tristram Stuart, one of the global band of anti­-waste campaigners, argues that, with freshly made sandwiches, over­-ordering is standard practice across the retail sector to avoid the appearance of empty shelf space, leading to high volumes of waste when supply regularly exceeds demand.",
		"In the studies of Colin Cherry at the Massachusetts Institute for Technology back in the 1950s, his participants listened to voices in one ear at a time and then through both ears in an effort to determine whether we can listen to two people talk at the same time. One ear always contained a message that the listener had to repeat back (called “shadowing”) while the other ear included people speaking. The trick was to see if you could totally focus on the main message and also hear someone talking in your other ear. Cleverly, Cherry found it was impossible for his participants to know whether the message in the other ear was spoken by a man or woman, in English or another language, or was even comprised of real words at all! In other words, people could not process two pieces of information at the same time.",
		"The best way in which innovation changes our lives is by enabling people to work for each other. The main theme of human history is that we become steadily more specialized in what we produce, and steadily more diversified in what we consume: we move away from unstable self-sufficiency to safer mutual interdependence. By concentrating on serving other people’s needs for forty hours a week—which we call a job—you can spend the other seventy-two hours (not counting fifty-six hours in bed) relying on the services provided to you by other people. Innovation has made it possible to work for a fraction of a second in order to be able to afford to turn on an electric lamp for an hour, providing the quantity of light that would have required a whole day’s work if you had to make it yourself by collecting and refining sesame oil or lamb fat to burn in a simple lamp, as much of humanity did in the not so distant past.",
		"If you’ve ever made a poor choice, you might be interested in learning how to break that habit. One great way to trick your brain into doing so is to sign a “Ulysses Contract.” The name of this life tip comes from the Greek myth about Ulysses, a captain whose ship sailed past the island of the Sirens, a tribe of dangerous women who lured victims to their death with their irresistible songs. Knowing that he would otherwise be unable to resist, Ulysses instructed his crew to stuff their ears with cotton and tie him to the ship’s mast to prevent him from turning their ship towards the Sirens. It worked for him and you can do the same thing by locking yourself out of your temptations. For example, if you want to stay off your cellphone and concentrate on your work, delete the apps that distract you or ask a friend to change your password!",
		"Our homes aren’t just ecosystems, they’re unique ones, hosting species that are adapted to indoor environments and pushing evolution in new directions. Indoor microbes, insects, and rats have all evolved the ability to survive our chemical attacks, developing resistance to antibacterials, insecticides, and poisons. German cockroaches are known to have developed a distaste for glucose, which is commonly used as bait in roach traps. Some indoor insects, which have fewer opportunities to feed than their outdoor counterparts, seem to have developed the ability to survive when food is limited. Dunn and other ecologists have suggested that as the planet becomes more developed and more urban, more species will evolve the traits they need to thrive indoors. Over a long enough time period, indoor living could drive our evolution, too. Perhaps my indoorsy self represents the future of humanity.",
		"If you want the confidence that comes from achieving what you set out to do each day, then it’s important to understand how long things are going to take. Over­optimism about what can be achieved within a certain time frame is a problem. So work on it. Make a practice of estimating the amount of time needed alongside items on your ‘things to do’ list, and learn by experience when tasks take a greater or lesser time than expected. Give attention also to fitting the task to the available time. There are some tasks that you can only set about if you have a significant amount of time available. There is no point in trying to gear up for such a task when you only have a short period available. So schedule the time you need for the longer tasks and put the short tasks into the spare moments in between.",
		"In Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking­Glass, the Red Queen takes Alice on a race through the countryside. They run and they run, but then Alice discovers that they’re still under the same tree that they started from. The Red Queen explains to Alice: “here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.” Biologists sometimes use this Red Queen Effect to explain an evolutionary principle. If foxes evolve to run faster so they can catch more rabbits, then only the fastest rabbits will live long enough to make a new generation of bunnies that run even faster—in which case, of course, only the fastest foxes will catch enough rabbits to thrive and pass on their genes. Even though they might run, the two species just stay in place.",
		"Everything in the world around us was finished in the mind of its creator before it was started. The houses we live in, the cars we drive, and our clothing⸻all of these began with an idea. Each idea was then studied, refined and perfected before the first nail was driven or the first piece of cloth was cut. Long before the idea was turned into a physical reality, the mind had clearly pictured the finished product. The human being designs his or her own future through much the same process. We begin with an idea about how the future will be. Over a period of time we refine and perfect the vision. Before long, our every thought, decision and activity are all working in harmony to bring into existence what we have mentally concluded about the future.",
		"Think of the brain as a city. If you were to look out over a city and ask “where is the economy located?” you’d see there’s no good answer to the question. Instead, the economy emerges from the interaction of all the elements― from the stores and the banks to the merchants and the customers. And so it is with the brain’s operation: it doesn’t happen in one spot. Just as in a city, no neighborhood of the brain operates in isolation. In brains and in cities, everything emerges from the interaction between residents, at all scales, locally and distantly. Just as trains bring materials and textiles into a city, which become processed into the economy, so the raw electrochemical signals from sensory organs are transported along superhighways of neurons. There the signals undergo processing and transformation into our conscious reality.",
		"Someone else’s body language affects our own body, which then creates an emotional echo that makes us feel accordingly. As Louis Armstrong sang, “When you’re smiling, the whole world smiles with you.” If copying another’s smile makes us feel happy, the emotion of the smiler has been transmitted via our body. Strange as it may sound, this theory states that emotions arise from our bodies. For example, our mood can be improved by simply lifting up the corners of our mouth. If people are asked to bite down on a pencil lengthwise, taking care not to let the pencil touch their lips (thus forcing the mouth into a smile­-like shape), they judge cartoons funnier than if they have been asked to frown. The primacy of the body is sometimes summarized in the phrase “I must be afraid, because I’m running.”",
		"Restricting the number of items customers can buy boosts sales. Brian Wansink, Professor of Marketing at Cornell University, investigated the effectiveness of this tactic in 1998. He persuaded three supermarkets in Sioux City, Iowa, to offer Campbell’s soup at a small discount: 79 cents rather than 89 cents. The discounted soup was sold in one of three conditions: a control, where there was no limit on the volume of purchases, or two tests, where customers were limited to either four or twelve cans. In the unlimited condition shoppers bought 3.3 cans on average, whereas in the scarce condition, when there was a limit, they bought 5.3 on average. This suggests scarcity encourages sales. The findings are particularly strong because the test took place in a supermarket with genuine shoppers. It didn’t rely on claimed data, nor was it held in a laboratory where consumers might behave differently.",
		"The famous primatologist Frans de Waal, of Emory University, says humans downplay similarities between us and other animals as a way of maintaining our spot at the top of our imaginary ladder. Scientists, de Waal points out, can be some of the worst offenders—employing technical language to distance the other animals from us. They call “kissing” in chimps “mouth­-to­-mouth contact”; they call “friends” between primates “favorite affiliation partners”; they interpret evidence showing that crows and chimps can make tools as being somehow qualitatively different from the kind of toolmaking said to define humanity. If an animal can beat us at a cognitive task—like how certain bird species can remember the precise locations of thousands of seeds—they write it off as instinct, not intelligence. This and so many more tricks of language are what de Waal has termed “linguistic castration.” The way we use our tongues to disempower animals, the way we invent words to maintain our spot at the top.",
		"A key to engagement and achievement is providing students with relevant texts they will be interested in. My scholarly work and my teaching have been deeply influenced by the work of Rosalie Fink. She interviewed twelve adults who were highly successful in their work, including a physicist, a biochemist, and a company CEO. All of them had dyslexia and had had significant problems with reading throughout their school years. While she expected to find that they had avoided reading and discovered ways to bypass it or compensate with other strategies for learning, she found the opposite. “To my surprise, I found that these dyslexics were enthusiastic readers......they rarely avoided reading. On the contrary, they sought out books.” The pattern Fink discovered was that all of her subjects had been passionate in some personal interest. The areas of interest included religion, math, business, science, history, and biography. What mattered was that they read voraciously to find out more.",
		"For many people, ability refers to intellectual competence, so they want everything they do to reflect how smart they are—writing a brilliant legal brief, getting the highest grade on a test, writing elegant computer code, saying something exceptionally wise or witty in a conversation. You could also define ability in terms of a particular skill or talent, such as how well one plays the piano, learns a language, or serves a tennis ball. Some people focus on their ability to be attractive, entertaining, up on the latest trends, or to have the newest gadgets. However ability may be defined, a problem occurs when it is the sole determinant of one’s self­-worth. The performance becomes the only measure of the person; nothing else is taken into account. An outstanding performance means an outstanding person; an average performance means an average person. Period.",
		"Participants in a study were asked to answer questions like “Why does the moon have phases?” Half the participants were told to search for the answers on the internet, while the other half weren’t allowed to do so. Then, in the second part of the study, all of the participants were presented with a new set of questions, such as “Why does Swiss cheese have holes?” These questions were unrelated to the ones asked during the first part of the study, so participants who used the internet had absolutely no advantage over those who hadn’t. You would think that both sets of participants would be equally sure or unsure about how well they could answer the new questions. But those who used the internet in the first part of the study rated themselves as more knowledgeable than those who hadn’t, even about questions they hadn’t searched online for. The study suggests that having access to unrelated information was enough to pump up their intellectual confidence.",
		"Anthropologist Gregory Bateson suggests that we tend to understand the world by focusing in on particular features within it. Take platypuses. We might zoom in so closely to their fur that each hair appears different. We might also zoom out to the extent where it appears as a single, uniform object. We might take the platypus as an individual, or we might treat it as part of a larger unit such as a species or an ecosystem. It’s possible to move between many of these perspectives, although we may need some additional tools and skills to zoom in on individual pieces of hair or zoom out to entire ecosystems. Crucially, however, we can only take up one perspective at a time. We can pay attention to the varied behavior of individual animals, look at what unites them into a single species, or look at them as part of bigger ecological patterns. Every possible perspective involves emphasizing certain aspects and ignoring others.",
		"Plato’s realism includes all aspects of experience but is most easily explained by considering the nature of mathematical and geometrical objects such as circles. He asked the question, what is a circle? You might indicate a particular example carved into stone or drawn in the sand. However, Plato would point out that, if you looked closely enough, you would see that neither it, nor indeed any physical circle, was perfect. They all possessed flaws, and all were subject to change and decayed with time. So how can we talk about perfect circles if we cannot actually see or touch them? Plato’s extraordinary answer was that the world we see is a poor reflection of a deeper unseen reality of Forms, or universals, where perfect cats chase perfect mice in perfect circles around perfect rocks. Plato believed that the Forms or universals are the true reality that exists in an invisible but perfect world beyond our senses.",
		"No respectable boss would say, “I make it a point to discourage my staff from speaking up, and I maintain a culture that prevents disagreeing viewpoints from ever getting aired.” If anything, most bosses even say that they are pro­-dissent. This idea can be found throughout the series of conversations with corporate, university, and nonprofit leaders, published weekly in the business sections of newspapers. In the interviews, the featured leaders are asked about their management techniques, and regularly claim to continually encourage internal protest from more junior staffers. As Bot Pittman remarked in one of these conversations: “I want us to listen to these dissenters because they may intend to tell you why we can’t do something, but if you listen hard, what they’re really telling you is what you must do to get something done.”",
		"One of the most striking characteristics of a sleeping animal or person is that they do not respond normally to environmental stimuli. If you open the eyelids of a sleeping mammal the eyes will not see normally—they are functionally blind. Some visual information apparently gets in, but it is not normally processed as it is shortened or weakened; same with the other sensing systems. Stimuli are registered but not processed normally and they fail to wake the individual. Perceptual disengagement probably serves the function of protecting sleep, so some authors do not count it as part of the definition of sleep itself. But as sleep would be impossible without it, it seems essential to its definition. Nevertheless, many animals (including humans) use the intermediate state of drowsiness to derive some benefits of sleep without total perceptual disengagement.",
		"A number of research studies have shown how experts in a field often experience difficulties when introducing newcomers to that field. For example, in a genuine training situation, Dr Pamela Hinds found that people expert in using mobile phones were remarkably less accurate than novice phone users in judging how long it takes people to learn to use the phones. Experts can become insensitive to how hard a task is for the beginner, an effect referred to as the ‘curse of knowledge’. Dr Hinds was able to show that as people acquired the skill, they then began to underestimate the level of difficulty of that skill. Her participants even underestimated how long it had taken themselves to acquire that skill in an earlier session. Knowing that experts forget how hard it was for them to learn, we can understand the need to look at the learning process through students’ eyes, rather than making assumptions about how students ‘should be’ learning.",
		"The biggest trap many family gardeners fall into is creating a garden that is too large. Even though you may have the best of intentions, over time a garden that is too large will become a maintenance nightmare. My family, like many others, eagerly planted large gardens only to cut back slowly on the time devoted to gardening. Sometime in September, we ended up with a garden full of over-ripened fruit and out-of­-control, overgrown plants. This situation is not enjoyable for adult gardeners, let alone for children. Most children (and many adults) won’t enjoy spending their warm sunny days tending an overgrown garden plot. When thinking about the size of your family garden, be realistic. Plan the size according to the time your family can devote to the garden.",
		"Compared to past generations, we are quite well off. In the past fifty years, the average buying power has more than tripled. We own a lot of electronic devices that are designed to make our lives easier, but still, as sociologists are eager to point out, there is no end to the list of things to do in our daily lives. We work as hard as our grandparents did, and the result is flawlessness but not freedom. The curtain edges are free of dirt, the picture hooks on the wall are firmly in place, and our eggs come out just the way we like them. The more we have, the more we want. The result is an apparent scarcity of time, a dilemma that seems to grow with each passing year, even though there is plenty of time to go around. Feeling pressed for time is the price we pay for an abundance of options.",
		"For the last 20 years, some educators have believed that children should not be allowed to experience failure. Educational situations were structured so that every child could be successful nearly all the time. It was reasoned that the experience of failure would discourage students from future study. In the field of science, however, finding out what does not work is as important as finding out what does. In fact, real advances in science tend to occur when solutions do not fit the predictions. Although students should not be constantly faced with frustrating learning situations, a positive attitude toward failure may better serve them in developing problem­-solving skills. After all, in much of scientific inquiry, there are no right or wrong answers.",
		"A miser tries to save his money. But he is failing to utilize what he owns. If he were to realize how he is limiting his true wealth, he would hasten to find some worthy person or institution that would benefit from a portion of his fortune. The part that he gives away might seem to diminish the size of his fortune. However, in reality what he gives away remains his eternal possession. And the true size of his fortune is calculated by what he gives and not by what he keeps. Some people use the expression, “He is worth ‘X’ amount of money.” They usually refer to a person’s money and property that has not yet been given away. The expression would be more accurate if the calculations included what one has donated to others.",
		"Anyone who has ever achieved any degree of success knows that nothing in life worth having comes easily. Success is borne on the shoulders of commitment, discipline, and persistence. Yet our popular culture conveys a very different message to children: success doesn’t have to be difficult or time consuming. Popular culture is full of stories about overnight successes, pills to lose weight fast, and “breakthrough” products to look ten years younger. Children see young actors such as Hilary Duff and Haley Joel Osment and musical geniuses like the violinist Sarah Chang, but they don’t see the many years of determination, practice, and sacrifice that got them to the top of their professions. Children don’t realize that overnight successes are usually ten years in the making.",
		"The violent reality of war has a damaging effect on every level of our humanity─our bodies, our minds, and our spirits. Once I had the opportunity to live in Bethlehem, on the West Bank, for three years. During that time, I often traveled back and forth from Bethlehem to Jerusalem. On one trip, when the border was closed to Palestinians, I happened to arrive at a checkpoint at the same time as a young Palestinian woman. She was carrying a newborn, her first child, trying to take it to the hospital in Jerusalem. The young mother appeared to be around nineteen years old, about the same age as the soldier who met her at the checkpoint. Her attempts to convince him to allow her to cross the border went from talking to pleading to crying. Seeing the woman’s growing desperation, the soldier was obviously moved. It was clear that she was sincere in her attempt to take her child to the hospital. As the conversation grew more intense, I noticed that both the young mother and the equally young soldier began to cry together. It was sad to watch, as the soldier could only deny her entry into Jerusalem even though it was completely against his wishes. I was struck by the pain and anguish that both of these young people endured because of the political situation.",
		"Not only is it easy to lie with maps, but it’s essential. A map must distort reality in order to portray a complex, three­-dimensional world on a flat sheet of paper. To take a simple example, a map is a scale model, but the symbols it uses for parks, restaurants, and other places are not drawn to the same scale, which-if taken literally-would make them much bigger or smaller in reality. Furthermore, a map cannot show everything, or it will hide critical information in a fog of detail. The map, therefore, must offer a selective, incomplete view of reality. There’s no escape from the map­making paradox: to present a useful and truthful picture, an accurate map must tell white lies.",
		"We get pleasure by reading a book. When we read a book about the people who have a lot in common with us, it doubles the pleasure, leading us beyond our own lives and allowing us to understand those of others. But this is not the only reason for the pleasure we derive from books. In everyday life we are so involved in what is happening-so much affected by our emotions that we can not appreciate them properly. Of course, our own lives would be a novel worthy of Dickens or Hemingway, but we get no pleasure from our lives-quite the contrary. Therefore, the writer’s task is to give us a faithful picture of life, but to keep it far enough away for us to be able to appreciate it without fear or confusion.",
		"How do you relax yourself when things seem scary? One way is to understand that our bodies are machines that were designed in ancient times when our reflexes had to be quicker for survival. Our lives are evidence for those of our ancestors who possessed quick reflexes: slower ancestors didn’t live long enough to pass their genes along. Breathing is the key to calmness. The fight or flight response-our age­-old response to real or imagined threat -depends on delivering oxygen quickly and efficiently to muscles that need to be ready for action. During this adrenaline rush, your heart rate increases, your blood vessels redirect blood supply, and you begin to sweat. Real or perceived danger throws the body into overdrive, literally. Thus, it is necessary to control your breathing. Ordinarily, we parallel breath, in and out. To enter into a more relaxed state, practice square breathing, which is inhaling to the count of four, and holding to the count of four, exhaling to the count of four, and holding for four. With practice, you can increase the intervals and slow things down even more. Not only is square breathing good for confidence building, but it is also good for relaxation, talking to the boss about a raise, preparing for a speech, or going out on a date.",
		"Teams made up of diverse specialists are infamous for their inability to get things done. Despite the best­laid plans of the managers who assemble such teams, the differences among members frequently lead to poor communication, conflict, and confusion. Members new to one another simply don’t understand when and how to communicate. Some groups never master this; and even in groups that do, the process takes time, slowing progress toward team goals. Familiarity can help a group overcome this obstacle: Once a team has learned when and how to communicate on one project, it can carry those skills over to the next. Research shows that many teams struggle to make use of the knowledge each individual brings to the task, because their members don’t know who has what information. Discovering this knowledge can take time and effort; the more frequently the same individuals work together, the better an organization performs.",
		"One of our brains’ especially frustrating habits is to focus on getting a reward, and then experience a feeling of loss once we get it. This cycle can spin us into a loop of wanting, getting, and regretting. Awareness that you are caught in the cycle is essential. If you are bidding on items online and find yourself compelled to keep bidding up the price of an item beyond its value or what you intended to spend, force yourself to become aware that what you are doing is no longer in your best interest. The action part is harder because you have to abandon the target. If you don’t, you cannot expect merely thinking rationally to correct the problem, because it rarely ever does. We are master justifiers, and almost any rational reason given for stopping an action can be taken apart in minutes or less. Action in this case is absolutely necessary: stop and walk away.",
		"Renowned investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett once said, “You can determine the strength of a business over time by the amount of agony they go through in raising prices.” Buffett and his partner, Charlie Munger, realized that as customers form routines around a product, they come to depend upon it and become less price­-sensitive. The duo have pointed to consumer psychology as the rationale behind their famed investments in companies like See’s Candies and Coca­Cola. Buffett and Munger understand that habits give companies greater flexibility to increase prices. For example, in the free­-to­-play video game business, it is standard practice for game developers to delay asking users to pay money until they have played consistently and habitually. Once the compulsion to play is in place and the desire to progress in the game increases, converting users into paying customers is much easier. Selling virtual items, extra lives, and special powers is where the real money lies.",
		"In a 1996 research project led by Roy Baumeister at Case Western Reserve University, scientists had two groups of people sit down in separate rooms. On the table in the rooms were two bowls, one was of fresh chocolate chip cookies and the other contained radishes. The first group was told that they could eat as many of the cookies that they wanted but that they were to avoid the radishes at all costs. The second group was told the opposite. After a while the scientists came back in and asked the participants to wait. Each group was given an “easy” puzzle to solve while they waited. The puzzle actually had no solution but the scientists wanted to see how long each group would attempt to find the solution. The results were that the people who had to resist the cookies only spent 8 minutes on the puzzle while the other group spent an average of 19 minutes on it. Why? It appears that willpower is finite. The people who were told to resist the cookies had used up their reserve for the day. Think about it. Have you ever had a task you normally do in the morning and forgotten about it? Then, when you remember, you say that you are going to do it as soon as you get home? But, you don’t. That’s because you have spent the willpower that you have been allotted for the day. So, if you are wanting to accomplish a specific goal, it is best if you set aside some time in the morning, before your daily routine begins, and get something done on it while you still have your full store of willpower for the day.",
		"We live in an age of opportunity: If you’ve got ambition, drive, and smarts, you can rise to the top of your chosen profession―regardless of where you started out. But with this opportunity comes responsibility. Companies today aren’t managing their knowledge workers’ careers. Rather, we must each be our own chief executive officer. Simply put, it’s up to you to keep yourself engaged and productive during a work life. To do all of these things well, you’ll need to cultivate a deep understanding of yourself. What are your most valuable strengths and most dangerous weakness? Equally important, how do you learn and work with others? What are your most deeply held values? The implication is clear: Only when you operate from a combination of your strengths and self-knowledge can you achieve true― and lasting―excellence.",
		"In order to succeed, a work of art must be above a certain minimum size, but this requirement is not about the nature of art so much as about the nature of the human perceptive apparatus. Without sufficient size, no object can be perceived as having parts that can be arranged in a pattern, or a perceptible structure. A lion or a shark, therefore, can be beautiful, because their parts form a meaningful, well-structured whole. A flea, however, cannot be beautiful, not because it is a trifling or disagreeable animal, but because it is too minute for the unaided eye to perceive parts that are arranged meaningfully. A speck cannot possibly by itself be beautiful; beauty is only possible where an object has visible parts.",
		"Consciousness is one of the most profound puzzles of existence, and it is a cutting-edge topic of investigation among scientists. How is it that mere physical processes in the brain give rise to the subjective, conscious experience? One of the promising hypotheses for how consciousness arises comes from John Searle. He claims that as an emergent property, the processes and elements within the brain cause consciousness, but it is not a property of any individual elements. For example, consider a cup of coffee. The liquidity of the coffee is explained by the behavior of the molecules that compose it, but none of the individual molecules are liquid. Consciousness, like the liquidity of brewed coffee, is a property that emerges from the behavior of many individual elements that cannot be reduced or explained by any single element in the system.",
		"From the moment instant baking mixes of all kinds were introduced in the late 1940s, they had a strong presence in American grocery carts, and ultimately at the dinner table. However, not all mixes were greeted with equal enthusiasm. Housewives were peculiarly reluctant to use instant cake mixes, which required simply adding water. Some marketers wondered whether the cake mixes were too sweet or artificial-tasting. But no one could explain why the mixes used to make biscuits, having pretty much the same basic ingredients, were so popular, while cake mixes didn’t sell. One explanation was that the cake mixes simplified the process to such an extent that the women did not feel as though the cakes they made were “theirs.” Normally, biscuits are not a dish by themselves. A housewife could happily receive a compliment on a dish that included a purchased component without feeling that it was inappropriately earned. A cake, on the other hand, is often served by itself and represents a complete dish. On top of that, cakes often carry great emotional significance, symbolizing special occasions. A would-be baker would hardly be willing to consider herself someone who makes birthday cakes from “just a mix.” Not only would she feel humiliated or guilty but she might also disappoint her guests. They would feel that they were not being treated to something special.",
		"Compared with farmers, hunter­-gatherers led a more leisurely life. Modern anthropologists who have spent time with surviving hunter­-gatherer groups report that gathering food only accounts for a small proportion of their time―far less than would be required to produce the same quantity of food via farming. The !Kung Bushmen of the Kalahari, for example, typically spend twelve to nineteen hours a week collecting food, and the Hazda nomads of Tanzania spend less than fourteen hours. That leaves a lot of time free for leisure activities, socializing, and so on. When asked by an anthropologist why his people had not adopted farming, one Bushman replied, “Why should we plant, when there are so many mongongo nuts in the world?” In effect, hunter­-gatherers work two days a week and have five­-day weekends.",
		"Noise pollution can take many forms. In writing, one of the major sources of unwelcome noise actually doesn’t make a sound, but it can become deafening. You may have often heard that typing an e­mail or other writings in all capital letters “shouts” your message to your readers. Perhaps this is so, because the mere size alone of every letter emphasizes its importance. But bigger is not necessarily better and the same applies to writing. The true problem with trying to read all capital letters is just that: It’s difficult. A line or two, perhaps even a short paragraph, is fine when you want to emphasize an idea or express a warning. However, if you write a whole essay in all capital letters, it annoys the reader. In elementary school, we learned to read in upper­ and lowercase. As adults we continue this practice, and so do the major newspapers, textbooks, journals, and magazines we read. Even the dialogue of some comic books is printed in upper­ and lowercase. Also, typing words in all capital letters makes primary information indistinguishable from the rest of the text, supporting and secondary details. What’s of major importance? What’s not? Typing in all capital letters often indicates that the writer disregards the reader.",
		"Ant colonies have their own personalities, which are shaped by the environment. Having a personality means showing a consistent pattern of behavior over time. Colonies of several hundreds of ants show differences in the way they behave, just like individual people do. Researchers from the University of Arizona studied colonies of rock ants across the western US, both in the wild and in the lab. They found certain behaviors go together―for example, a colony that explores more widely for food also tends to respond more aggressively to an intruder. Such a colony has a more “risk­-taking” personality and this is more common in the north, where the climate is colder. The study suggests those more adventurous personalities could be an adaptation to the limited period of activity caused by the long, snowy northern climate.",
		"An illustration of the dangers of unrealistic optimism comes from a study of weight loss. In that study, psychologist Gabriele Oettingen found that the obese women who were confident that they would succeed lost 26 pounds more than self­-doubters, as expected. Meanwhile, Oettingen also asked the women to tell her what they imagined their roads to success would be like. The results were surprising: women who believed they would succeed easily lost 24 pounds less than those who thought their weight­-loss journeys would be hard. Believing that the road to success will be rocky leads to greater success, because it forces us to put in more effort and persist longer in the face of difficulty. It is necessary to cultivate our realistic optimism by combining a positive attitude with an honest assessment of the challenges.",
		"Different goods and services have different values. National income accounting requires measuring the value of production. The most common measure is Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It is the market value of all final goods and services produced in a year within a country’s borders. This definition excludes any production not traded on markets. For example, voluntary labor, such as fixing a friend’s bike or helping a neighbor with their lawnmower, constitutes unpaid service provision. It is not about a worker earning a wage or a consumer buying a service. In a similar fashion, housework performed by members of the household is not included in the GDP, even though the same work, when performed by paid house cleaners, is. These cases mean that the official GDP calculations do not cover all the actual production.",
		"Years ago, the G.E. Company was faced with the delicate task of removing Charles Steinmetz from the head of a department. Steinmetz, a genius of the first magnitude when it came to electricity, was a failure as the head of the calculating department. Yet the company didn’t dare offend the man. He was indispensable - and highly sensitive. So they gave him a new title. They made him Consulting Engineer of G.E. - a new title for work he was already doing - and let someone else head up the department. Steinmetz was happy. So were the officers of G.E. They had done it without a storm by letting him save face. How important, how vitally important that is! And how few of us ever stop to think of it! We do not think about the feelings of others, getting our own way, finding fault, and criticizing an employee in front of others, without ever considering the hurt to the other person’s pride. On the contrary, a few minutes’ thought, a considerate word or two, and a genuine understanding of the other person’s attitude would go so far toward relieving the hurt. Even if we are right and the other person is definitely wrong, we only destroy ego by causing someone to lose face. A legendary French author once wrote: I have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes. What matters is not what we think of him, but what he thinks of himself. Hurting a man’s dignity is a crime.",
		"John Wooden, the great UCLA basketball coach who produced 10 NCAA championship teams in 12 years during the 1960s and 1970s, perfectly exemplified the power of consistency. In the fascinating film documentary The UCLA Dynasty, one player recalled, “There was a way to do everything. You could have taken UCLA people who played in 1955, 1965, 1970, and 1975; put them on the same team; and they would have been able to play with each other, instantly.” Wooden ran his drills with rare modifications over the course of three decades. Drills would start and end like clockwork, the same drills performed before the national championship as at the beginning of the season so that, in the words of a star player, “By the time the games came along, they just became memorized exhibitions of brilliance.”",
		"Although trust may require a meaningful relationship to satisfy its more demanding analysts, it need not require goodwill. When A is a person and B is a bank, A may trust B to keep her money safe although she does not imagine for a moment that the bank feels warmly disposed to her, and she may well suspect that it will assert its interests at her expense when it gets a chance to impose charges or manipulate interest rates. If A enters hospital and is examined by Doctor B, she may trust B’s professional expertise and integrity even though B appears indifferent to her as a person. Until relatively recently indifference on the part of medical professionals, or plain rudeness, was if anything regarded as a sign of trustworthiness: it implied the objectivity needed for expertise, and asserted the superior status that medical expertise granted.",
		"What distinguishes recycling is not its importance, but rather the ease with which individuals can participate, and the visibility of actions taken to promote the common good. You may care passionately about the threat of global warming or the destruction of the rain forests―but you can’t have an immediate effect on these problems that is perceptible to yourself or others. The rain forest salvation truck doesn’t make weekly pickups, let alone the clean air truck. When a public opinion poll in 1990 asked people what they had done in connection with environmental problems, 80 to 85% answered that they or their households had participated in various aspects of recycling; no other significant steps had been taken by a majority of respondents. Like the drunk looking for his wallet under the lamppost, we may focus on recycling because it is where the immediate tasks are best illuminated.",
		"Like few other institutions in American life, baseball, football, basketball, and hockey are a source of social glue and civic pride. From Yankee Stadium in New York to Candlestick Park in San Francisco, sports stadiums are the cathedrals of our civil religion, public spaces that gather people from different walks of life in rituals of loss and hope. But professional sports is not only a source of civic identity. It is also a business. And in recent decades, the money in sports has been crowding out the community. It would be an exaggeration to say that naming rights and corporate sponsorships have ruined the experience of rooting for the home team. Still, changing the name of a civic landmark changes its meaning. This is one reason why Detroit fans mourned when Tiger Stadium, named for the team, gave way to Comerica Park, named for a bank. When fans go to the ballpark or arena, they don’t go primarily for the sake of a civic experience. They go to see David Ortiz hit a home run in the bottom of the ninth, or to see Tom Brady throw a touchdown pass in the final seconds of the game. But the public character of the setting conveys a civic teaching―that we are all in this together, that for a few hours at least, we share a sense of place and civic pride. As stadiums become less like landmarks and more like billboards, the social bonds and civic sentiments they inspire fade.",
		"Today it often seems we remember very little. When I wake up, the first thing I do is check my day planner, which remembers my schedule so that I don’t have to. When I climb into my car, I enter my destination into the GPS, whose spatial memory supplants my own. When I sit down to work, I open up a notebook that holds the contents of my interviews. Now, thanks to the Internet, I rarely have to remember anything more than the right set of search terms to access humankind’s collective memory. Growing up, in the days when you still had to press seven buttons, or turn a clunky rotary dial, to make a telephone call, I could recall the numbers of all my close friends and family. Today, I’m not sure if I know more than four phone numbers by heart. And that’s probably more than most people do. Our gadgets eliminate the need to remember such things.",
		"When children are very young, you first say no to protect them from danger. You say it because you love your child and because you must teach him to protect himself. Just as saying no is a tool to help ensure your child’s physical safety, it also contributes to his emotional security. When you set limits on your child’s behavior, whether it’s telling a five-year-old he can’t hit the baby or telling a teenager he can’t stay out past midnight, you’re letting him know that his actions don’t happen in a vacuum. He is connected to someone(you) who watches and cares what he does. All children need a safe space in which to grow and develop. While it’s a child’s nature to test the limits of that space, by climbing higher, venturing farther, or asking for more of what he wants, it’s also comforting for him to know he is not out there alone.",
		"Imagine tossing a coin over and over, and let’s say that the coin has landed heads up six times in a row. Many people believe that in this situation the coin is more likely to come up tails than heads on the next toss. But this conclusion is wrong, and this belief is commonly referred to as the “gambler’s fallacy.” The logic leading to this fallacy seems to be that if the coin is fair, then a series of tosses should contain equal numbers of heads and tails. If no tails have appeared for a while, then some are overdue to bring about this balance. But how could this be? The coin has no memory, so it has no way of knowing how long it has been since the last tails. More generally, there simply is no mechanism through which the history of the previous tosses could influence the current one. Therefore, the likelihood of a tail on toss number 7 is 50-50, just as it was on the first toss, and just as it is on every toss.",
		"As an expert in the area of neuroeconomics, Baba Shiv carried out a fantastic experiment. He thought that ‘cognitive load’ (having lots to hold in your head―a situation most professionals find themselves in) might influence self-control. He gave half his volunteers a two-digit number to remember (representing a low cognitive load) and gave the other half a seven-digit number (a high load). The volunteers were then told to walk to another room in the building and in so doing pass a table where they had to choose between chocolate cake (high fat and sugary food) or fruit salad (low fat and nutritious food). Of the people with the high load, 59 percent opted for cake whereas only 37 percent of the people with the low load did. Shiv thinks that remembering seven numbers required cognitive resources that had to come from somewhere, and in this case were taken from our ability to control our urges! Anatomically this is reasonable because working memory (where we ‘store’ the seven or two numbers) and self-control are both located in the same part of our brain. The brain cells that would normally be helping us make healthy food choices were otherwise engaged in remembering seven numbers. In those instances we have to rely on our more impulsive emotions, such as ‘Mmmm yummy! Chocolate cake please.’",
		"You can actually become your own cheerleader by talking to yourself positively and then acting as if you were already the person that you wanted to be. Act as though you were trying out for the role of a positive, cheerful, happy, and likable person. Walk, talk, and act as if you were already that person. Treat everyone you meet as though you had just won an award for being the very best person in your industry or as though you had just won the lottery. You will be amazed at how much better you feel about yourself after just a few minutes of pretending.",
		"Imagine this scene. There are six people in an elevator with an actor hired by researchers. The actor drops a bunch of coins and pencils. They fall to the floor with a clatter. And then, as the elevator goes down floor by floor, not one person moves a muscle to help. The people in the elevator have to notice the actor picking up the coins and pencils on the floor. Some people may feel uncomfortable and might silently wonder whether to get involved. But each person is surrounded by five others who are doing nothing. If the people knew they were being tested, every one would instantly come to the aid of the stranger. But in the context of everyday life, where people are not thinking deliberately about how others are influencing them, going along with the group just feels like the natural thing to do.",
		"Patients should be aware that there can be differing views among specialists about who should be treated for various conditions. For example, expert committees in Europe and the United States set different guidelines about when to treat high blood pressure. The group of American experts believed that for mild elevation of blood pressure the benefits exceeded the risks from treatment. They wrote guidelines suggesting that patients with mild blood pressure elevation take medicine. But in Europe, an expert committee with access to the same scientific data set different guidelines that don’t advise treatment for mild elevation of blood pressure. In Europe, people with the same symptoms would not be encouraged to take medicine. Different groups of experts can disagree significantly about what is “best practice.”",
		"Today’s consumers are not just looking for a good product at a fair price. They are looking beyond the product or service to the ethics of the company that supplies it. The shift in focus by consumers is evident in their concerns about the companies they purchase from. For example, there is growing interest in labor practices, environmental policies, and social responsibilities. Also, there is a pressure to get companies to present not just financial results, but also social and environmental results and impact. Companies need to respond to the pressure because customers are voicing their concerns in every way, from boycotting stores to suing companies. Some multinational companies have experienced the anger of ethical consumers in recent years, and have been forced to respond quickly to protect their reputations and their existence as companies. This growing emphasis on ethical consumption is a trend that cannot be ignored. It is not going to go away. There are some important changes in the world indicating that ethical consumers will continue to be a growing force in the next few decades. Companies would do well to understand this trend and make efforts to deal with it.",
		"The English political scientist John Stuart Mill realized that it is not only within the goods market that a lack of competition is able to push prices up. Monopoly effects can also emerge in the labor market. He pointed to the case of goldsmiths, who earned much higher wages than workers of a similar skill because they were perceived to be trustworthy―a characteristic that is rare and not easily provable. This created a significant barrier to entry so that those working with gold could demand a monopoly price for their services. Mill realized that the goldsmiths’ situation was not an isolated case. He noted that large sections of the working classes were barred from entering skilled professions because they entailed many years of education and training. The cost of supporting someone through this process was out of reach for most families, so those who could afford it were able to enjoy wages far above what might be expected.",
		"Although people most commonly think of persuasion as deep processing, it is actually shallow processing that is the more common way to influence behavior. For example, Facebook started inserting advertisements in the middle of users’ webpages. Many users didn’t like this change and, on principle, refused to click on the ads. However, this approach displays a fundamental misunderstanding of the psychology behind the ads. The truth is that Facebook never expected anyone to click on the ads. All the company wants is to expose you to those product brands and images. The more times you’re exposed to something, in general, the more you like it. Everyone is influenced by the familiarity of an image. So, even though you can ignore the ads, by simply being in front of your eyes, they’re doing their work.",
		"In science, we can never really prove that a theory is true. All we can do in science is use evidence to reject a hypothesis. Experiments never directly prove that a theory is right; all they can do is provide indirect support by rejecting all the other theories until only one likely theory remains. For example, sometimes you hear people say things like ‘evolution is only a theory: science has never proved it.’ Well, that’s true, but only in the sense that science never proves that any theory is positively true. But the theory of evolution has assembled an enormous amount of convincing data proving that other competing theories are false. So though it hasn’t been proved, overwhelmingly, evolution is the best theory that we have to explain the data we have.",
		"There is no known cure for the ills of ownership. As Adam Smith said, ownership is woven into our lives. But being aware of it might help. Everywhere around us we see the temptation to improve the quality of our lives by buying a larger home, a second car, a new dishwasher, a lawn mower, and so on. But, once we upgrade our possessions we have a very hard time going back down. Ownership simply changes our perspective. Suddenly, moving backward to our pre­-ownership state is a loss, one that we cannot accept. And so, while moving up in life, we fall into the fantasy that we can always return to the previous state, but in reality, it’s unlikely. Downgrading to a smaller home, for instance, is experienced as a loss, it is psychologically painful, and we are willing to make all kinds of sacrifices in order to avoid such losses.",
		"Eye­-blocking is a nonverbal behavior that can occur when we feel threatened or don’t like what we see. Squinting and closing or shielding our eyes are actions that have evolved to protect the brain from seeing undesirable images. As an investigator, I used eye­-blocking behaviors to assist in the arson investigation of a tragic hotel fire in Puerto Rico. A security guard came under immediate suspicion because the blaze broke out in an area where he was assigned. One of the ways we determined he had nothing to do with starting the fire was by asking him some specific questions as to where he was before the fire, at the time of the fire, and whether or not he set the fire. After each question I observed his face for any telltale signs of eye­-blocking behavior. He blocked his eyes only when questioned about where he was when the fire started. Oddly, in contrast, he did not seem troubled by the question, “Did you set the fire?” This told me the real issue was his location at the time of the fire. He was questioned further by the investigators and eventually admitted to leaving his post to visit his girlfriend, who also worked at the hotel. Unfortunately, while he was gone, the arsonists entered the area he should have been guarding and started the fire. In this case, the guard’s eye­-blocking behavior gave us the insight we needed to pursue a line of questioning that eventually broke the case open.",
		"Changing our food habits is one of the hardest things we can do, because the impulses governing our preferences are often hidden, even from ourselves. And yet adjusting what you eat is entirely possible. We do it all the time. Were this not the case, the food companies that launch new products each year would be wasting their money. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, housewives from East and West Germany tried each other’s food products for the first time in decades. It didn’t take long for those from the East to realize that they preferred Western yogurt to their own. Equally, those from the West discovered a liking for the honey and vanilla wafer biscuits of the East. From both sides of the wall, these German housewives showed a remarkable flexibility in their food preferences.",
		"Life is a balancing act, and so is our sense of morality. Research suggests that when we view ourselves as morally deficient in one part of our lives, we search for moral actions that will balance out the scale. Maybe you know you should be recycling but just never get around to gathering up your glass, paper, and plastics in time for the recycling truck. One day you happen to be walking through a hardware store and notice a rack of energy­-efficient light bulbs, and you instantly decide to buy twenty of them and change out every bulb in your house. The moral deficiency (not recycling) is, in your view, balanced by a moral action (installing energy­-efficient bulbs). The problem is that the seesaw can also tip the other way: If we believe we are doing enough, morally speaking, then there’s little reason to do more. The scale is already level.",
		"The gap between the reality of online life and how we experience it prevents our discussion of Internet privacy. Consider email. People “know” email is not private. And yet many will use email, at least sometimes, for intimate correspondence. Over decades, I have asked why. The answer is always the same: When you stare at a screen, you feel completely alone. That sense of being alone with the person to whom you are writing―as though you were the only two people in the world―often blocks out what you know to be true. Email can be seen; it will be stored; and then it can be seen again. The seeming ephemerality of what is on the screen masks the truth: What you write is not erasable. More generally, the experience of the net undermines the reality of the net.",
		"We lose our words. Intelligence once meant more than what any artificial intelligence does. It used to include sensibility, sensitivity, awareness, reason, wit, etc. And yet we readily call machines intelligent now. Affective is another word that once meant a lot more than what any machine can deliver. Yet we have become used to describing machines that portray emotional states or can sense our emotional states as exemplars of “affective computing.” These new meanings become our new normal, and we forget other meanings. We have to struggle to recapture lost language, lost meanings, and perhaps, in time, lost experiences. At one conference I attended, the robots were called “caring machines,” and when I objected, I was told we were using this word not because the robots care but because they will take care of us. The conference participants believed caring is a behavior, a function, not a feeling. They seemed puzzled: Why did I care so much about semantics? What’s wrong with me? It is natural for words to change their meaning over time and with new circumstances. Intelligence and affective have changed their meaning to accommodate what machines can do. But now the words caring, friend, companionship, and conversation? A lot is at stake in these words. They are not yet lost. We need to remember these words and this conversation before we don’t know how to have it. Or before we think we can have it with a machine.",
		"Mathematical models of flocks of birds and schools of fish and swarms of insects that move in unison demonstrate the same point: there is no central control of the movement of the group, but the group manifests a kind of collective intelligence that helps all within it to flee or discourage predators. This behavior does not reside within individual creatures but, rather, is a property of groups. Examination of flocks of birds “deciding” where to fly reveals that they move in a way that accounts for the intentions of all the birds, and, even more important, the direction of movement is usually the best choice for the flock. Each bird contributes a bit, and the flock’s concerted choice is better than an individual bird’s would be.",
		"The Neanderthals would have faced a problem when it was daylight: the light quality is much poorer at high latitudes and this would have meant that they couldn’t see things in the distance so well. For a hunter, this is a serious problem, because you really don’t want to make the mistake of not noticing the mother rhinoceros hiding in a dark corner of the forest edge when trying to spear her calf. Living under low light conditions places a much heavier premium on vision than most researchers imagine. The evolutionary response to low light levels is to increase the size of the visual processing system. It is the familiar principle from conventional star-gazing telescopes: under the dim lighting of the night sky, a larger mirror allows you to gather more of the light from whatever you want to look at. By the same token, a larger retina allows you to receive more light to compensate for poor light levels.",
		"It’s possible to lie with numbers, even those that are accurate, because numbers rarely speak for themselves. They need to be interpreted by writers. And writers almost always have purposes that shape the interpretations. For example, you might want to announce the good news that unemployment in the United States stands at just a little over 5 percent. That means 95 percent of Americans have jobs, an employment rate much higher than that of most other industrial nations. But let’s spin the figure another way. In a country as populous as the United States, unemployment at 5 percent means that millions of Americans don’t earn a daily wage. Indeed, one out of every twenty adults who wants work can’t find it. Suddenly that’s a sobering number. And, as you can see, the same statistic can be cited as a cause for celebration or shame.",
		"Although organisms interact with their surroundings in many ways, certain factors may be critical to a particular species’ success. A shortage or absence of this factor restricts the success of the species; thus, it is known as a limiting factor. Limiting factors can be quite different from one species to another. The limiting factor for many species of fish is the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. In a swiftly flowing, tree-lined mountain stream, the level of dissolved oxygen is high and so provides a favorable environment for trout. As the stream continues down the mountain, the steepness of the slope decreases, which results in fewer rapids where the water tumbles over rocks and becomes oxygenated. In addition, as the stream becomes wider, the canopy of trees over the stream usually is thinner, allowing more sunlight to reach the stream and warm the water. Warm water cannot hold as much dissolved oxygen as cool water. Therefore, slower-flowing, warm-water streams contain less oxygen than rapidly moving, cool streams. Fish such as black bass and walleye are adapted to such areas, since they are able to tolerate lower oxygen concentrations and higher water temperatures. Trout are not able to survive under such conditions and are not found in warm, less well-oxygenated water. Thus, low levels of oxygen and high water temperatures are limiting factors for the distribution of trout.",
		"When Charles Darwin developed his theory of natural selection, he created a picture of the evolutionary process in which organismic adaptation was ultimately caused by competition for survival and reproduction. This biological “struggle for existence” bears considerable resemblance to the human struggle between businessmen who are striving for economic success in competitive markets. Long before Darwin published his work, social scientist Adam Smith had already considered that in business life, competition is the driving force behind economic efficiency and adaptation. It is indeed very striking how similar the ideas are on which the founders of modern theory in evolutionary biology and economics based their main thoughts.",
		"In 1944 the German rocket­-bomb attacks on London suddenly escalated. Over two thousand V­1 flying bombs fell on the city, killing more than five thousand people and wounding many more. Somehow, however, the Germans consistently missed their targets. Bombs that were intended for Tower Bridge, or Piccadilly, would fall well short of the city, landing in the less populated suburbs. This was because, in fixing their targets, the Germans relied on secret agents they had planted in England. They did not know that these agents had been discovered, and that in their place, English­-controlled agents were giving them subtly deceptive information. The bombs would hit farther and farther from their targets every time they fell. By the end of the attack they were landing on cows in the country. By feeding the enemy wrong information, the English army gained a strong advantage.",
		"Most people interact with commodities on a daily basis. If you really stop and think about it, most of what average people spend their money on revolves around the consumption of commodities. When you wake up in the morning, you might drink a cup of coffee. On the way to work, you might put gasoline in your car. When you pay your electric bills, buy a car, buy clothes, or even bake a cake, you are spending money on commodity­-related expenses. The prices of these items are dependent on the prices of the physical commodities. For instance, when crude oil prices rise because of increased tensions in the Middle East, you can easily see this in gasoline prices. When excessive heat drives up demand for natural gas, you can also see this in your utility bill.",
		"Our sense of how deprived we are is relative. This is an observation that is both obvious and (upon exploration) deeply profound, and it explains all kinds of otherwise puzzling observations. Which do you think, for example, has a higher suicide rate: countries whose citizens declare themselves to be very happy, such as Switzerland, Denmark, Iceland, the Netherlands, and Canada, or countries like Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, whose citizens describe themselves as not very happy at all? Answer: the so­-called happy countries. If you are depressed in a place where most people are pretty unhappy, you compare yourself to those around you and you don’t feel all that bad. But can you imagine how difficult it must be to be depressed in a country where everyone else has a big smile on their face?",
		"An artist or a child simply accepts whatever is in front of them as tool, toy, or environment, and proceeds from that point. Part of what is invigorating about the creative process is that it can start from humble materials and poor beginnings. There is a term in painting called “working with a limited palette;” a deliberate choice to work with fewer colors than actually available. With fewer options an artist can work more easily—less colors actually inspire her to creative resolutions. As a designer, I am often called upon to work with existing elements: logos, color palettes, slogans, etc. I see these limits as elements that actually help me; it is the limitations that help me free my creative imagination. Contemporary artist Vik Muniz uses everyday materials to replicate classic artwork. He has used chocolate syrup to render Leonardo da Vinci’s Last Supper, and has recreated the Mona Lisa with peanut butter and jelly. He uses what is around him—from spaghetti to toy soldiers —as the “paint” for his paintings. Like a child who doesn’t wait for perfect the tool or circumstances, an artist makes art from what he has around him. The artist sees inspiration where the ordinary person sees only a limitation or an obstacle.",
		"There are countless examples of scientific inventions that have been generated by accident. However, often this accident has required a person with above­-average knowledge in the field to interpret it. One of the better­-known examples of the cooperation between chance and a researcher is the invention of penicillin. In 1928, Scottish biologist Alexander Fleming went on a vacation. As a slightly careless man, Fleming left some bacterial cultures on his desk. When he returned, he noticed mold in one of his cultures, with a bacteria­-free zone around it. The mold was from the penicillium notatum species, which had killed the bacteria on the Petri dish. This was a lucky coincidence. For a person who does not have expert knowledge, the bacteria­-free zone would not have had much significance, but Fleming understood the magical effect of the mold. The result was penicillin — a medication that has saved countless people on the planet.",
		"Honeybees have evolved what we call “swarm intelligence,” with up to 50,000 workers in a single colony coming together to make democratic decisions. When a hive gets too crowded in springtime, colonies send scouts to look for a new home. If any scouts disagree on where the colony should build its next hive, they argue their case the civilized way: through a dance­-off. Each scout performs a “waggle dance” for other scouts in an attempt to convince them of their spot’s merit. The more enthusiastic the dance is, the happier the scout is with his spot. The remainder of the colony votes with their bodies, flying to the spot they prefer and joining in the dance until one potential hive overcomes all other dances of the neighborhood. It would be great if Congress settled their disagreements the same way.",
		"Confident leaders are not afraid to ask the basic questions: the questions to which you may feel embarrassed about not already knowing the answers. When you don’t know something, admit it as quickly as possible and immediately take action ― ask a question. If you have forgotten who the governor is or how many hydrogen atoms are in a molecule of water, quietly ask a friend but one way or the other, quit hiding, and take action. Paradoxically, when you ask basic questions, you will more than likely be perceived by others to be smarter. And more importantly, you’ll end up knowing far more over your lifetime. This approach will cause you to be more successful than you would have been had you employed the common practice of pretending to know more than you do. To make good leaders, effective teachers encourage, invite, and even force their students to ask those fundamental questions.",
		"We are extremely responsive to what we perceive people around us to be doing. This unconscious function has helped us make quick and good life­saving decisions throughout history. A study has shown how powerful this factor is. One practical experiment was an experiment conducted where a hotel wished their guests to reuse the towels in their rooms. They decided to put out a few signs. The first sign cited environmental reasons and the second sign said the hotel would donate a portion of end­-of­-year laundry savings. The third sign showed the majority of guests reused their towels at least once during their stay. To their surprise, guests responded most positively to the third sign. If you want to influence people to act a certain way, there are few more powerful methods than to give the impression that others are doing the action you desire them to do.",
		"My buddy and his wife were in constant conflict over when the housework should get done. He wanted to work in spurts and take frequent breaks to watch a TV show or make a nice meal. She wanted to get it all done at a time and have the rest of the day to hang out and relax. I was able to point out to my buddy that his wife wasn’t trying to be a strict trainer; she was just more of a sensing, thinking, judging sort of person, and he was more of an intuition, feeling, perceiving sort of person. Neither of them were wrong; they just had different preferences. Once they realized this, they were able to compromise regarding the housework. When they needed to get a lot of chores done in a short period of time, they used her method, but they agreed to always take a meal break at the appropriate meal hour. When they just had a few things to get done in no specific time frame, they used his method but agreed that they would see the specific task to completion before taking a break. This way, both of them could feel productive, and the housework no longer had to be a huge sore spot between them.",
		"We are the CEOs of our own lives. We work hard to urge ourselves to get up and go to work and do what we must do day after day. We also try to encourage the people working for and with us, those who are doing business with us, and even those who regulate us. We do this in our personal lives, too: From a very young age, kids try to persuade their parents to do things for them (“Dad, I’m too scared to do this!”) with varying degrees of success. As adults, we try to encourage our significant others to do things for us (“Sweetie, I had such a stressful day today, can you please put the kids to bed and do the dishes?”). We attempt to get our kids to clean up their rooms. We try to induce our neighbors to help out with a neighborhood party. Whatever our official job descriptions, we are all part­-time motivators.",
		"In many regions of Central America, native people can but do not grow green vegetables packed with vital nutrients such as vitamin A. Generally speaking, the people do not have a tradition of raising these crops. They often have limited education in general and almost no exposure to health and nutrition advice, and they grow what feeds the most people. They often have plenty of tortillas and beans, so they have sufficient protein, and they eat until full. Yet the lack of micronutrients leads to their children developing blindness, iron deficiency, and other growth disorders. In these situations, families have to be educated about nutrition, encouraged to diversify their diets, plant more green vegetables, and sometimes receive nutritional assistance to correct imbalances.",

		"This true story is about a government­-owned shoe factory in Poland in the days when the country had a much more socialist economy. Every month, the Polish government gave the factory materials, and the manager was told to produce a fixed number of shoes. Because there was no profit motive involved, the manager’s basic goal was to meet the quota in the easiest possible way―by producing only small shoes. This production strategy created a problem for people who had big feet, and so the government revised the system. Now the factory received the same amount of materials, but instead of producing a fixed number of shoes, the factory was expected to produce a fixed number of tons of shoes. In other words, the factory’s output would now be weighed rather than counted. And again, the factory’s manager responded in the most efficient way, by producing nothing but huge shoes. In either situation, the government’s strategy did not provide any motivation to produce shoes in various sizes that met people’s needs.",
		"A new study published in Science reveals that people generally approve of driverless, or autonomous, cars programmed to sacrifice their passengers in order to save pedestrians, but these same people are not enthusiastic about riding in such autonomous vehicles (AVs) themselves. In six online surveys of U.S. residents conducted in 2015, researchers asked participants how they would want their AVs to behave. The scenarios involved in the surveys varied in the number of pedestrian and passenger lives that could be saved, among other factors. For example, participants were asked whether it would be more moral for AVs to sacrifice one passenger rather than kill 10 pedestrians. Survey participants said that AVs should be programmed to be utilitarian and to minimize harm to pedestrians, a position that would put the safety of those outside the vehicle ahead of the driver and passengers’ safety. The same respondents, however, said they prefer to buy cars that protect them and their passengers, especially if family members are involved. This suggests that if both self­-protective and utilitarian AVs were allowed on the market, few people would be willing to ride in the latter —even though they would prefer others to do so. The inconsistency, which illustrates an ethical tension between the good of the individual and that of the public, persisted across a wide range of survey scenarios analyzed.",
		"What is the true nature of the brain? The brain is a slow-changing machine, and thats a good thing. If your brain could completely change overnight, you would be unstable. Lets just say that your norm is to wake up, read the paper with coffee and a bagel, walk your dog, and watch the news. This is your habitual routine. Then one night, you get a phone call at 3 a.m. and have to run outside in your underwear to check on your neighbors. What if your brain latched on to this new routine and you continued to run outside at 3 a.m. every night in your underwear? Nobody would want that, so its a good thing our brains require more repetition than that! Lets accept and be thankful for the stability our slow-changing brains provide us.",
		"Hearing is basically a specialized form of touch. Sound is simply vibrating air which the ear picks up and converts to electrical signals, which are then interpreted by the brain. The sense of hearing is not the only sense that can do this; touch can do this too. If you are standing by the road and a large truck goes by, do you hear or feel the vibration? The answer is both. With very low frequency vibration the ear starts becoming inefficient and the rest of the body’s sense of touch starts to take over. For some reason we tend to make a distinction between hearing a sound and feeling a vibration, but in reality they are the same thing. Deafness does not mean that you cant hear, only that there is something wrong with the ears. Even someone who is totally deaf can still hear/feel sounds.",
		"Veblen goods are named after Thorstein Veblen, a US economist who formulated the theory of conspicuous consumption . They are strange because demand for them increases as their price rises. According to Veblen, these goods must signal high status. A willingness to pay higher prices is due to a desire to advertise wealth rather than to acquire better quality. A true Veblen good, therefore, should not be noticeably higher quality than the lower-priced equivalents. If the price falls so much that it is no longer high enough to exclude the less well off, the rich will stop buying it. There is much evidence of this behavior in the markets for luxury cars, champagne, watches, and certain clothing labels. A reduction in prices might see a temporary increase in sales for the seller, but then sales will begin to fall.",
		"In 2009, Emily Holmes asked a group of adults to watch a video featuring eleven clips of traumatic content including graphic real scenes of human surgery and fatal road traffic accidents. This was their trauma simulation, and the participants were indeed traumatized. Before watching the video, they reported feeling calm and relaxed; afterward they were disturbed and anxious. Holmes forced the adults to wait for thirty minutes. Then, half the participants played a block-matching puzzle video game for ten minutes, while the other half sat quietly. The adults went home for a week, and recorded their thoughts in a daily diary. Once a day they recalled the scenes from the video that replayed in their minds. Those who had sat quietly after watching the video experienced an average of six flashbacks; those who had played the game experienced an average of fewer than three. The video game, with its colors and music and rotating blocks, prevented the initial traumatic memories from solidifying. The game soaked up the mental attention that might have otherwise moved those horrific memories to long-term memory, and so they were stored imperfectly or not at all. At the end of the week, the adults returned to the lab, and those who had been lucky enough to play the game reported fewer psychiatric symptoms. The video game had functioned as a cognitive vaccine, the researchers explained.",
		"Most importantly, money needs to be scarce in a predictable way. Precious metals have been desirable as money across the millennia not only because they have intrinsic beauty but also because they exist in fixed quantities. Gold and silver enter society at the rate at which they are discovered and mined; additional precious metals cannot be produced, at least not cheaply. Commodities like rice and tobacco can be grown, but that still takes time and resources. A dictator like Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe could not order the government to produce 100 trillion tons of rice. He was able to produce and distribute trillions of new Zimbabwe dollars, which is why they eventually became more valuable as toilet paper than currency.",
		"In one experiment, children were told they could have one marshmallow treat if they chose to eat it immediately, but two treats if they waited. Most of the children, who ranged in age from 4 to 8, chose to wait, but the strategies they used differed significantly. The 4­-year­-olds often chose to look at the marshmallows while waiting, a strategy that was not terribly effective. In contrast, 6­ and 8­-year­-olds used language to help overcome temptation, although in different ways. The 6­-year­-olds spoke and sang to themselves, reminding themselves they would get more treats if they waited. The 8­-year­-olds focused on aspects of the marshmallows unrelated to taste, such as appearance, which helped them to wait. In short, children used “self­-talk” to regulate their behavior.",
		"The desire for fame has its roots in the experience of neglect. No one would want to be famous who hadn’t also, somewhere in the past, been made to feel extremely insignificant. We sense the need for a great deal of admiring attention when we have been painfully exposed to earlier deprivation. Perhaps one’s parents were hard to impress. They never noticed one much, they were so busy with other things, focusing on other famous people, unable to have or express kind feelings, or just working too hard. There were no bedtime stories and one’s school reports weren’t the subject of praise and admiration. That’s why one dreams that one day the world will pay attention. When we’re famous, our parents will have to admire us too.",
		"When the late Theodore Roosevelt came back from Africa, just after he left the White House in 1909, he made his first public appearance at Madison Square Garden. Before he would agree to make the appearance, he carefully arranged for nearly one thousand paid applauders to be scattered throughout the audience to applaud his entrance on the platform. For more than 15 minutes, these paid hand­-clappers made the place ring with their enthusiasm. The rest of the audience took up the suggestion and joined in for another quarter hour. The newspaper men present were literally swept off their feet by the tremendous applause given the American hero, and his name was emblazoned across the headlines of the newspapers in letters two inches high. Roosevelt understood and made intelligent use of personal promotion.",
		"Mary is an interior designer. A friend of hers bought a house that needed to be renovated, and had asked her to do the interior decoration. Mary wanted the interior of the house to look attractive. However, she would ignore safety standards and would not listen to other contractors, if she did not think their proposals fit her ideals. For all the home products she picked for the house, her main concern was whether they looked attractive, not whether they were effective or reliable. She chose a fancy­-looking door lock, against the advice of the locksmith who did not think it was dependable. As a consequence, a year later, it was necessary to change the door lock, as there was difficulty opening the lock with the key. In addition, she picked toilets in an upscale model and design. However, the homeowner later found out that the toilet handle must be held down to complete the flushing action. The plumber was not able to adjust the lever inside the toilet tank to fix the problem. Mary prefers to think that she is always right. She chooses information that fits her liking, and ignores other people’s recommendations. However, when facing a problem, we should always have an open mind, and should consider all relevant information. We definitely should not let our prejudice and emotion take the better part of us.",
		"Do you advise your kids to keep away from strangers? That’s a tall order for adults. After all, you expand your network of friends and create potential business partners by meeting strangers. Throughout this process, however, analyzing people to understand their personalities is not all about potential economic or social benefit. There is your safety to think about, as well as the safety of your loved ones. For that reason, Mary Ellen O’Toole, who is a retired FBI profiler, emphasizes the need to go beyond a person’s superficial qualities in order to understand them. It is not safe, for instance, to assume that a stranger is a good neighbor, just because they’re polite. Seeing them follow a routine of going out every morning well‑dressed doesn’t mean that’s the whole story. In fact, O’Toole says that when you are dealing with a criminal, even your feelings may fail you. That’s because criminals have perfected the art of manipulation and deceit.",
		"“Survivorship bias” is a common logical fallacy. We’re prone to listen to the success stories from survivors because the others aren’t around to tell the tale. A dramatic example from history is the case of statistician Abraham Wald who, during World War Ⅱ, was hired by the U.S. Air Force to determine how to make their bomber planes safer. The planes that returned tended to have bullet holes along the wings, body, and tail, and commanders wanted to reinforce those areas because they seemed to get hit most often. Wald, however, saw that the important thing was that these bullet holes had not destroyed the planes, and what needed more protection were the areas that were not hit. Those were the parts where, if a plane was struck by a bullet, it would never be seen again. His calculations based on that logic are still in use today, and they have saved many pilots.",
		"In the early 2000s, British psychologist Richard Wiseman performed a series of experiments with people who viewed themselves as either ‘lucky’(they were successful and happy, and events in their lives seemed to favor them) or ‘unlucky’(life just seemed to go wrong for them). What he found was that the ‘lucky’ people were good at spotting opportunities. In one experiment he told both groups to count the number of pictures in a newspaper. The ‘unlucky’ diligently ground their way through the task; the ‘lucky’ usually noticed that the second page contained an announcement that said: “Stop counting—there are 43 photographs in this newspaper.” On a later page, the ‘unlucky’ were also too busy counting images to spot a note reading: “Stop counting, tell the experimenter you have seen this, and win $250.” Wiseman’s conclusion was that, when faced with a challenge, ‘unlucky’ people were less flexible. They focused on a specific goal, and failed to notice that other options were passing them by.",
		"Appreciating the collective nature of knowledge can correct our false notions of how we see the world. People love heroes. Individuals are given credit for major breakthroughs. Marie Curie is treated as if she worked alone to discover radioactivity and Newton as if he discovered the laws of motion by himself. The truth is that in the real world, nobody operates alone. Scientists not only have labs with students who contribute critical ideas, but also have colleagues who are doing similar work, thinking similar thoughts, and without whom the scientist would get nowhere. And then there are other scientists who are working on different problems, sometimes in different fields, but nevertheless set the stage through their own findings and ideas. Once we start understanding that knowledge isn’t all in the head, that it’s shared within a community, our heroes change. Instead of focusing on the individual, we begin to focus on a larger group.",
		"David Stenbill, Monica Bigoutski, Shana Tirana. I just made up these names. If you encounter any of them within the next few minutes, you are likely to remember where you saw them. You know, and will know for a while, that these are not the names of minor celebrities. But suppose that a few days from now you are shown a long list of names, including those of some minor celebrities and “new” names of people that you have never heard of; your task will be to check every name of a celebrity on the list. There is a substantial probability that you will identify David Stenbill as a well‑known person, although you will not know whether you encountered his name in the context of movies, sports, or politics. Larry Jacoby, the psychologist who first demonstrated this memory illusion in the laboratory, titled his article “Becoming Famous Overnight”. How does this happen? Start by asking yourself how you know whether or not someone is famous. In some cases of truly famous people, you have a mental file with rich information about a person—think Albert Einstein, Michael Jackson, or Hillary Clinton. But you will have no file of information about David Stenbill if you encounter his name in a few days. All you will have is a sense of familiarity.",
		"Online environments vary widely in how easily you can save whatever happens there, what I call its recordability and preservability. Even though the design, activities, and membership of social media might change over time, the content of what people posted usually remains intact. Email, video, audio, and text messages can be saved. When perfect preservation is possible, time has been suspended. Whenever you want, you can go back to reexamine those events from the past. In other situations, permanency slips between our fingers, even challenging our reality testing about whether something existed at all, as when an email that we seem to remember receiving mysteriously disappears from our inbox. The slightest accidental tap of the finger can send an otherwise everlasting document into nothingness.",
		"Verbal and nonverbal signs are not only relevant but also significant to intercultural communication. The breakdown of them helps to identify aspects of conversations. Here is an excellent example. Newly hired Indian and Pakistani assistants in a staff cafeteria at Heathrow Airport were often perceived as rude or uncooperative by their supervisors and the airport staff, while the Indian and Pakistani women complained of discrimination. Observation revealed that intonation patterns were the primary cause. When the staff ordered meat, the cafeteria assistant was supposed to ask them whether they would like to have some gravy. Instead of saying “gravy?” with a rising intonation, the Asian assistants would say “gravy” with a falling intonation, which is their normal way of asking a question. However, this may appear rude to native speakers of English: “gravy” with falling intonation came across as a statement, suggesting “This is gravy. Take it or leave it.”",
		"Science can only tell us how the world appears to us, not how it is independent of our observation of it, and therefore right now will always elude science. When you look into space, you are looking into an ancient past. Some of the stars are already long dead yet we still see them because of their traveling light. Let’s say that we are on one of those stars situated roughly sixty million light­years away. If we had a really awesome telescope pointed at the earth, we would see the dinosaurs walking around. The end of the universe is probably so old that if we had that telescope, we might be able to see the beginning. Besides faraway things, even the immediate objects around us are all afterimages of the past because there is still a time lag for the reflection of light to reach our eyes. Every sensation our body feels has to wait for the information to be carried to the brain.",
		"For many centuries European science, and knowledge in general, was recorded in Latin―a language that no one spoke any longer and that had to be learned in schools. Very few individuals, probably less than one percent, had the means to study Latin enough to read books in that language and therefore to participate in the intellectual discourse of the times. Moreover, few people had access to books, which were handwritten, scarce, and expensive. The great explosion of scientific creativity in Europe was certainly helped by the sudden spread of information brought about by Gutenberg’s use of movable type in printing and by the legitimation of everyday languages, which rapidly replaced Latin as the medium of discourse. In sixteenth­-century Europe it became much easier to make a creative contribution not necessarily because more creative individuals were born then than in previous centuries or because social supports became more favorable, but because information became more widely accessible.",
		"In 2000, James Kuklinski of the University of Illinois led an influential experiment in which more than 1,000 Illinois residents were asked questions about welfare. More than half indicated that they were confident that their answers were correct―but in fact, only three percent of the people got more than half of the questions right. Perhaps more disturbingly, the ones who were the most confident they were right were generally the ones who knew the least about the topic. Kuklinski calls this sort of response the “I know I’m right” syndrome. “It implies not only that most people will resist correcting their factual beliefs,” he wrote, “but also that the very people who most need to correct them will be least likely to do so.” How can we have things so wrong and be so sure that we’re right? Part of the answer lies in the way our brains are wired. Generally, people tend to seek consistency. There is a substantial body of psychological research showing that people tend to interpret information with an eye toward reinforcing their preexisting views. If we believe something about the world, we are more likely to passively accept as truth any information that confirms our beliefs, and actively dismiss information that doesn’t. This is known as “motivated reasoning.” Whether or not the consistent information is accurate, we might accept it as fact, as confirmation of our beliefs. This makes us more confident in said beliefs, and even less likely to entertain facts that contradict them.",
		"A good many scientists and artists have noticed the universality of creativity. At the Sixteenth Nobel Conference, held in 1980, scientists, musicians, and philosophers all agreed, to quote Freeman Dyson, that “the analogies between science and art are very good as long as you are talking about the creation and the performance. The creation is certainly very analogous. The aesthetic pleasure of the craftsmanship of performance is also very strong in science.” A few years later, at another multidisciplinary conference, physicist Murray Gell-Mann found that “everybody agrees on where ideas come from. We had a seminar here, about ten years ago, including several painters, a poet, a couple of writers, and the physicists. Everybody agrees on how it works. All of these people, whether they are doing artistic work or scientific work, are trying to solve a problem.”",
		"For several years much research in psychology was based on the assumption that human beings are driven by base motivations such as aggression, egoistic self-interest, and the pursuit of simple pleasures. Since many psychologists began with that assumption, they inadvertently designed research studies that supported their own presuppositions. Consequently, the view of humanity that prevailed in psychology was that of a species barely keeping its aggressive tendencies in check and managing to live in social groups more out of motivated self-interest than out of a genuine affinity for others or a true sense of community. Both Sigmund Freud and the early behaviorists led by John B. Watson believed that humans were motivated primarily by selfish drives. From that perspective, social interaction is possible only by exerting control over those baser emotions and, therefore, it is always vulnerable to eruptions of violence, greed, and selfishness. The fact that humans actually live together in social groups has traditionally been seen as a tenuous arrangement that is always just one step away from violence.",
		"A vast academic literature provides empirical support for the thesis that it pays to be green. Large data sets have been constructed, measuring firm environmental behavior and financial performance across a wide number of industries and over many years. While the results are not unequivocal, there is evidence suggestive of a positive correlation between environmental performance and financial performance. In our own work, we find that, on average, a 10% decrease in a company’s toxic emissions as reported in the US Environmental Protection Agency’s Toxic Release Inventory— a database of toxic emissions from US manufacturing facilities —results in an average 3% increase in a firm’s financial performance as measured by return on assets. Another study suggests that a 10% reduction in emissions could result in a $34 million increase in market value.",
		"Scientific knowledge cannot account for correct aesthetic appreciation of nature because science represents natural objects as members of a specific class, rather than as individual entities. The science-based approach claims that aesthetically relevant properties are only those properties that all members of a natural kind share with each other. But this is not true. When we experience nature, we do not experience it as species, but as individual objects. And as separated into individual objects, nature can have aesthetic properties that are not entailed by its scientific description. Natural science can explain, for instance, the formation of the waterfall, but it has nothing to say about our experience of the majestic Victoria Falls when viewed at sunset, its reds and oranges countless and captivating; geology can explain the formation of the Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania, but not its painful and breathtaking beauty at sunrise, the fog slowly lifting above the crater and a lone hippopotamus dark and heavy in the lake.",
		"While complex, blockchains exhibit a set of core characteristics, which flow from the technology’s reliance on a peer-to-peer network, public-private key cryptography, and consensus mechanisms. Blockchains are disintermediated and transnational. They are resilient and resistant to change, and enable people to store nonrepudiable data, pseudonymously, in a transparent manner. Most—if not all —blockchain-based networks feature market-based or game-theoretical mechanisms for reaching consensus, which can be used to coordinate people or machines. These characteristics, when combined, enable the deployment of autonomous software and explain why blockchains serve as a powerful new tool to facilitate economic and social activity that otherwise would be difficult to achieve. At the same time, these characteristics represent the technology’s greatest limitations. The disintermediated and transnational nature of blockchains makes the technology difficult to govern and makes it difficult to implement changes to a blockchain’s underlying software protocol. Because blockchains are pseudonymous and have a tamper-resistant data structure supported by decentralized consensus mechanisms, they can be used to coordinate socially unacceptable or criminal conduct, including conduct facilitated by autonomous software programs. Moreover, because blockchains are transparent and traceable, they are prone to being co-opted by governments or corporations, transforming the technology into a powerful tool for surveillance and control.",
		"Would you expect the physical expression of pride to be biologically based or culturally specific? The psychologist Jessica Tracy has found that young children can recognize when a person feels pride. Moreover, she found that isolated populations with minimal Western contact also accurately identify the physical signs. These signs include a smiling face, raised arms, an expanded chest, and a pushed­-out torso. Tracy and David Matsumoto examined pride responses among people competing in judo matches in the 2004 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Sighted and blind athletes from 37 nations competed. After victory, the behaviors displayed by sighted and blind athletes were very similar. These findings suggest that pride responses are innate.",
		"Sometimes a person is acclaimed as “the greatest” because there is little basis for comparison. For example, violinist Jan Kubelik was acclaimed as “the greatest” during his first tour of the United States, but when impresario Sol Hurok brought him back to the United States in 1923, several people thought that he had slipped a little. However, Sol Elman, the father of violinist Mischa Elman, thought differently. He said, “My dear friends, Kubelik played the Paganini concerto tonight as splendidly as ever he did. Today you have a different standard. You have Elman, Heifetz, and the rest. All of you have developed and grown in artistry, technique, and, above all, in knowledge and appreciation. The point is: you know more; not that Kubelik plays less well.”",
		"Theseus was a great hero to the people of Athens. When he returned home after a war, the ship that had carried him and his men was so treasured that the townspeople preserved it for years and years, replacing its old, rotten planks with new pieces of wood. The question Plutarch asks philosophers is this: is the repaired ship still the same ship that Theseus had sailed? Removing one plank and replacing it might not make a difference, but can that still be true once all the planks have been replaced? Some philosophers argue that the ship must be the sum of all its parts. But if this is true, then as the ship got pushed around during its journey and lost small pieces, it would already have stopped being the ship of Theseus.",
		"Credit arrangements of one kind or another have existed in all known human cultures. The problem in previous eras was not that no one had the idea or knew how to use it. It was that people seldom wanted to extend much credit because they didn’t trust that the future would be better than the present. They generally believed that times past had been better than their own times and that the future would be worse. To put that in economic terms, they believed that the total amount of wealth was limited. People therefore considered it a bad bet to assume that they would be producing more wealth ten years down the line. Business looked like a zero­-sum game. Of course, the profits of one particular bakery might rise, but only at the expense of the bakery next door. The king of England might enrich himself, but only by robbing the king of France. You could cut the pie in many different ways, but it never got any bigger.",
		"Psychologists Leon Festinger, Stanley Schachter, and sociologist Kurt Back began to wonder how friendships form. Why do some strangers build lasting friendships, while others struggle to get past basic platitudes? Some experts explained that friendship formation could be traced to infancy, where children acquired the values, beliefs, and attitudes that would bind or separate them later in life. But Festinger, Schachter, and Back pursued a different theory. The researchers believed that physical space was the key to friendship formation; that “friendships are likely to develop on the basis of brief and passive contacts made going to and from home or walking about the neighborhood.” In their view, it wasn’t so much that people with similar attitudes became friends, but rather that people who passed each other during the day tended to become friends and so came to adopt similar attitudes over time.",
		"As entrepreneur Derek Sivers put it, “The first follower is what transforms a lone nut into a leader.” If you were sitting with seven other people and six group members picked the wrong answer, but the remaining one chose the correct answer, conformity dropped dramatically. “The presence of a supporting partner depleted the majority of much of its pressure,” Asch wrote. Merely knowing that you’re not the only resister makes it substantially easier to reject the crowd. Emotional strength can be found even in small numbers. In the words of Margaret Mead, “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful citizens can change the world; indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has.” To feel that you’re not alone, you don’t need a whole crowd to join you. Research by Sigal Barsade and Hakan Ozcelik shows that in business and government organizations, just having one friend is enough to significantly decrease loneliness.",
		"At the pharmaceutical giant Merck, CEO Kenneth Frazier decided to motivate his executives to take a more active role in leading innovation and change. He asked them to do something radical: generate ideas that would put Merck out of business. For the next two hours, the executives worked in groups, pretending to be one of Merck’s top competitors. Energy soared as they developed ideas for drugs that would crush theirs and key markets they had missed. Then, their challenge was to reverse their roles and figure out how to defend against these threats. This “kill the company” exercise is powerful because it reframes a gain­-framed activity in terms of losses. When deliberating about innovation opportunities, the leaders weren’t inclined to take risks. When they considered how their competitors could put them out of business, they realized that it was a risk not to innovate. The urgency of innovation was apparent.",
		"The whole history of mathematics is one long sequence of taking the best ideas of the moment and finding new extensions, variations, and applications. Our lives today are totally different from the lives of people three hundred years ago, mostly owing to scientific and technological innovations that required the insights of calculus. Isaac Newton and Gottfried von Leibniz independently discovered calculus in the last half of the seventeenth century. But a study of the history reveals that mathematicians had thought of all the essential elements of calculus before Newton or Leibniz came along. Newton himself acknowledged this flowing reality when he wrote, “If I have seen farther than others it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants.” Newton and Leibniz came up with their brilliant insight at essentially the same time because it was not a huge leap from what was already known. All creative people, even ones who are considered geniuses, start as non-geniuses and take baby steps from there.",
		"Children develop the capacity for solitude in the presence of an attentive other. Consider the silences that fall when you take a young boy on a quiet walk in nature. The child comes to feel increasingly aware of what it is to be alone in nature, supported by being “with” someone who is introducing him to this experience. Gradually, the child takes walks alone. Or imagine a mother giving her two­-year­-old daughter a bath, allowing the girl’s reverie with her bath toys as she makes up stories and learns to be alone with her thoughts, all the while knowing her mother is present and available to her. Gradually, the bath, taken alone, is a time when the child is comfortable with her imagination. Attachment enables solitude.",
		"Much of the spread of fake news occurs through irresponsible sharing. A 2016 study from Columbia University in New York City and Inria, a French technology institute, found that 59 percent of the news from links shared on social media wasn’t read first. People see an intriguing headline or photo in their news feed or on another website and then click the Share button to repost the item to their social media friends―without ever clicking through to the full article. Then they may be sharing fake news. To stop the spread of fake news, read stories before you share them. Respect your social media friends enough to know what information you are sending their way. You may discover, on close inspection, that an article you were about to share is obviously fraudulent, that it doesn’t really say what the headline promises, or that you actually disagree with it.",
		"New technology tends to come from new ventures― startups. From the Founding Fathers in politics to the Royal Society in science to Fairchild Semiconductor’s “traitorous eight” in business, small groups of people bound together by a sense of mission have changed the world for the better. The easiest explanation for this is negative: it’s hard to develop new things in big organizations, and it’s even harder to do it by yourself. Bureaucratic hierarchies move slowly, and entrenched interests shy away from risk. In the most dysfunctional organizations, signaling that work is being done becomes a better strategy for career advancement than actually doing work. At the other extreme, a lone genius might create a classic work of art or literature, but he could never create an entire industry. Startups operate on the principle that you need to work with other people to get stuff done, but you also need to stay small enough so that you actually can.",
		"If you want to use the inclined plane to help you move an object (and who wouldn’t?), then you have to move the object over a longer distance to get to the desired height than if you had started from directly below and moved upward. This is probably already clear to you from a lifetime of stair climbing. Consider all the stairs you climb compared to the actual height you reach from where you started. This height is always less than the distance you climbed in stairs. In other words, more distance in stairs is traded for less force to reach the intended height. Now, if we were to pass on the stairs altogether and simply climb straight up to your destination (from directly below it), it would be a shorter climb for sure, but the needed force to do so would be greater. Therefore, we have stairs in our homes rather than ladders.",
		"Once we own something, we’re far more likely to overvalue it. In a study conducted at Duke University, students who won basketball tickets in an extremely onerous lottery (one that they had to wait in line to enter for more than a day) said they wouldn’t sell their tickets for less than, on average, $2,400. But students who had waited and hadn’t won said they would only pay, on average, $170 per ticket. Once a student owned the tickets, he or she saw them as being worth much more in the market than they were. In another example, during the housing market crash of 2008, a real estate website conducted a survey to see how homeowners felt the crash affected the price of their homes. 92% of respondents, aware of nearby foreclosures, asserted these had hurt the price of homes in their neighborhood. However, when asked about the price of their own home, 62% believed it had increased.",
		"Are the different types of mobile device, smartphones and tablets, substitutes or complements? Let’s explore this question by considering the case of Madeleine and Alexandra, two users of these devices. Madeleine uses her tablet to take notes in class. These notes are synced to her smartphone wirelessly, via a cloud computing service, allowing Madeleine to review her notes on her phone during the bus trip home. Alexandra uses both her phone and tablet to surf the Internet, write emails and check social media. Both of these devices allow Alexandra to access online services when she is away from her desktop computer. For Madeleine, smartphones and tablets are complements. She gets greater functionality out of her two devices when they are used together. For Alexandra, they are substitutes. Both smartphones and tablets fulfil more or less the same function in Alexandra’s life. This case illustrates the role that an individual consumer’s behavior plays in determining the nature of the relationship between two goods or services.",
		"Thomas Edison was indeed a creative genius, but it was not until he discovered some of the principles of marketing that he found increased success. One of his first inventions was, although much needed, a failure. In 1869, he created and patented an electronic vote recorder, which recorded and totalled the votes in the Massachusetts state legislature faster than the chamber’s old manual system. To Edison’s astonishment, it failed. Edison had not taken into account legislators’ habits. They didn’t like to vote quickly and efficiently. They liked to lobby their fellow legislators as voting took place. Edison had a great idea, but he completely misunderstood the needs of his customers. He learned from his failure the relationship between invention and marketing. Edison learned that marketing and invention must be integrated. “Anything that won’t sell, I don’t want to invent,” he said. “Its sale is proof of utility, and utility is success.” He realized he needed to put the customers’ needs first and tailor his thinking accordingly.",
		"Attitude has been conceptualized into four main components: affective (feelings of liking or disliking), cognitive (beliefs and evaluation of those beliefs), behavioral intention (a statement of how one would behave in a certain situation), and behavior. Public attitudes toward a wildlife species and its management are generated based on the interaction of those components. In forming our attitudes toward wolves, people strive to keep their affective components of attitude consistent with their cognitive component. For example, I could dislike wolves; I believe they have killed people (cognitive belief), and having people killed is of course bad (evaluation of belief). The behavioral intention that could result from this is to support a wolf control program and actual behavior may be a history of shooting wolves. In this example, all aspects of attitude are consistent with each other, producing a negative overall attitude toward wolves.",
		"When he was dying, the contemporary Buddhist teacher Dainin Katagiri wrote a remarkable book called Returning to Silence. Life, he wrote, “is a dangerous situation.” It is the weakness of life that makes it precious; his words are filled with the very fact of his own life passing away. “The china bowl is beautiful because sooner or later it will break...... The life of the bowl is always existing in a dangerous situation.” Such is our struggle: this unstable beauty. This inevitable wound. We forget—how easily we forget—that love and loss are intimate companions, that we love the real flower so much more than the plastic one and love the cast of twilight across a mountainside lasting only a moment. It is this very fragility that opens our hearts.",
		"Nothing happens immediately, so in the beginning we can’t see any results from our practice. This is like the example of the man who tries to make fire by rubbing two sticks of wood together. He says to himself, “They say there’s fire here,” and he begins rubbing energetically. He rubs on and on, but he’s very impatient. He wants to have that fire, but the fire doesn’t come. So he gets discouraged and stops to rest for a while. Then he starts again, but the going is slow, so he rests again. By then the heat has disappeared; he didn’t keep at it long enough. He rubs and rubs until he gets tired and then he stops altogether. Not only is he tired, but he becomes more and more discouraged until he gives up completely, “There’s no fire here.” Actually, he was doing the work, but there wasn’t enough heat to start a fire. The fire was there all the time, but he didn’t carry on to the end.",
		"Translating academic language into everyday language can be an essential tool for you as a writer to clarify your ideas to yourself. For, as writing theorists often note, writing is generally not a process in which we start with a fully formed idea in our heads that we then simply transcribe in an unchanged state onto the page. On the contrary, writing is more often a means of discovery in which we use the writing process to figure out what our idea is. This is why writers are often surprised to find that what they end up with on the page is quite different from what they thought it would be when they started. What we are trying to say here is that everyday language is often crucial for this discovery process. Translating your ideas into more common, simpler terms can help you figure out what your ideas really are, as opposed to what you initially imagined they were.",
		"The growing field of genetics is showing us what many scientists have suspected for years⸻ foods can immediately influence the genetic blueprint. This information helps us better understand that genes are under our control and not something we must obey. Consider identical twins; both individuals are given the same genes. In mid­life, one twin develops cancer, and the other lives a long healthy life without cancer. A specific gene instructed one twin to develop cancer, but in the other the same gene did not initiate the disease. One possibility is that the healthy twin had a diet that turned off the cancer gene⸻ the same gene that instructed the other person to get sick. For many years, scientists have recognized other environmental factors, such as chemical toxins (tobacco for example), can contribute to cancer through their actions on genes. The notion that food has a specific influence on gene expression is relatively new.",
		"When is the right time for the predator to consume the fruit? The plant uses the color of the fruit to signal to predators that it is ripe, which means that the seed’s hull has hardened—and therefore the sugar content is at its height. Incredibly, the plant has chosen to manufacture fructose, instead of glucose, as the sugar in the fruit. Glucose raises insulin levels in primates and humans, which initially raises levels of leptin, a hunger‒blocking hormone —but fructose does not. As a result, the predator never receives the normal message that it is full. That makes for a win‒win for predator and prey. The animal obtains more calories, and because it keeps eating more and more fruit and therefore more seeds, the plant has a better chance of distributing more of its babies.",
		"We are often faced with high‒level decisions, where we are unable to predict the results of those decisions. In such situations, most people end up quitting the option altogether, because the stakes are high and results are very unpredictable. But there is a solution for this. You should use the process of testing the option on a smaller scale. In many situations, it’s wise to dip your toe in the water rather than dive in headfirst. Recently, I was about to enroll in an expensive coaching program. But I was not fully convinced of how the outcome would be. Therefore, I used this process by enrolling in a low‒cost mini course with the same instructor. This helped me understand his methodology, style, and content; and I was able to test it with a lower investment, and less time and effort before committing fully to the expensive program.",
		"Sociologists have proven that people bring their own views and values to the culture they encounter; books, TV programs, movies, and music may affect everyone, but they affect different people in different ways. In a study, Neil Vidmar and Milton Rokeach showed episodes of the sitcom All in the Family to viewers with a range of different views on race. The show centers on a character named Archie Bunker, an intolerant bigot who often gets into fights with his more progressive family members. Vidmar and Rokeach found that viewers who didn’t share Archie Bunker’s views thought the show was very funny in the way it made fun of Archie’s absurd racism―in fact, this was the producers’ intention. On the other hand, though, viewers who were themselves bigots thought Archie Bunker was the hero of the show and that the producers meant to make fun of his foolish family! This demonstrates why it’s a mistake to assume that a certain cultural product will have the same effect on everyone.",
		"The availability heuristic refers to a common mistake that our brains make by assuming that the instances or examples that come to mind easily are also the most important or prevalent. It shows that we make our decisions based on the recency of events. We often misjudge the frequency and magnitude of the events that have happened recently because of the limitations of our memories. According to Harvard professor, Max Bazerman, managers conducting performance appraisals often fall victim to the availability heuristic. The recency of events highly influences a supervisor’s opinion during performance appraisals. Managers give more weight to performance during the three months prior to the evaluation than to the previous nine months of the evaluation period because the recent instances dominate their memories. The availability heuristic is influenced by the ease of recall or retrievability of information of some event. Ease of recall suggests that if something is more easily recalled in your memory, you think that it will occur with a high probability.",
		"Firms in almost every industry tend to be clustered. Suppose you threw darts at random on a map of the United States. You’d find the holes left by the darts to be more or less evenly distributed across the map. But the real map of any given industry looks nothing like that; it looks more as if someone had thrown all the darts in the same place. This is probably in part because of reputation; buyers may be suspicious of a software firm in the middle of the cornfields. It would also be hard to recruit workers if every time you needed a new employee you had to persuade someone to move across the country, rather than just poach one from your neighbor. There are also regulatory reasons: zoning laws often try to concentrate dirty industries in one place and restaurants and bars in another. Finally, people in the same industry often have similar preferences (computer engineers like coffee, financiers show off with expensive bottles of wine). Concentration makes it easier to provide the amenities they like.",
		"When we are emotionally charged, we often use anger to hide our more primary and deeper emotions, such as sadness and fear, which doesn’t allow for true resolution to occur. Separating yourself from an emotionally upsetting situation gives you the space you need to better understand what you are truly feeling so you can more clearly articulate your emotions in a logical and less emotional way. A time­out also helps spare innocent bystanders. When confronted with situations that don’t allow us to deal with our emotions or that cause us to suppress them, we may transfer those feelings to other people or situations at a later point. For instance, if you had a bad day at work, you may suppress your feelings at the office, only to find that you release them by getting into a fight with your kids or spouse when you get home later that evening. Clearly, your anger didn’t originate at home, but you released it there. When you take the appropriate time to digest and analyze your feelings, you can mitigate hurting or upsetting other people who have nothing to do with the situation.",
		"A recent study shows that dogs appear to form mental images of people’s faces. Scientists placed 28 dogs in front of a computer monitor blocked by an opaque screen, then played a recording of the dog’s human guardian or a stranger saying the dog’s name five times through speakers in the monitor. Finally, the screen was removed to reveal either the face of the dog’s human companion or a stranger’s face. The dogs’ reactions were videotaped. Naturally, the dogs were attentive to the sound of their name, and they typically stared about six seconds at the face after the screen was removed. But they spent significantly more time gazing at a strange face after they had heard the familiar voice of their guardian. That they paused for an extra second or two suggests that they realized something was wrong. The conclusion drawn is that dogs form a picture in their mind, and that they can think about it and make predictions based on that picture. And, like us, they are puzzled when what they see or hear doesn’t match what they were expecting.",
		"In the current landscape, social enterprises tend to rely either on grant capital (e.g., grants, donations, or project funding) or commercial financing products (e.g., bank loans). Ironically, many social enterprises at the same time report of significant drawbacks related to each of these two forms of financing. Many social enterprises are for instance reluctant to make use of traditional commercial finance products, fearing that they might not be able to pay back the loans. In addition, a significant number of social enterprise leaders report that relying too much on grant funding can be a risky strategy since individual grants are time limited and are not reliable in the long term. Grant funding can also lower the incentive for leaders and employees to professionalize the business aspects, thus leading to unhealthy business behavior. In other words, there seems to be a substantial need among social enterprises for alternatives to the traditional forms of financing.",
		"Over 4.5 billion years ago, the Earth’s primordial atmosphere was probably largely water vapour, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen. The appearance and subsequent evolution of exceedingly primitive living organisms (bacteria-like microbes and simple single-celled plants) began to change the atmosphere, liberating oxygen and breaking down carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide. This made it possible for higher organisms to develop. When the earliest known plant cells with nuclei evolved about 2 billion years ago, the atmosphere seems to have had only about 1 percent of its present content of oxygen. With the emergence of the first land plants, about 500 million years ago, oxygen reached about one-third of its present concentration. It had risen to almost its present level by about 370 million years ago, when animals first spread on to land. Today’s atmosphere is thus not just a requirement to sustain life as we know it―it is also a consequence of life.",
		"One of the primary ways by which music is able to take on significance in our inner world is by the way it interacts with memory. Memories associated with important emotions tend to be more deeply embedded in our memory than other events. Emotional memories are more likely to be vividly remembered and are more likely to be recalled with the passing of time than neutral memories. Since music can be extremely emotionally evocative, key life events can be emotionally heightened by the presence of music, ensuring that memories of the event become deeply encoded. Retrieval of those memories is then enhanced by contextual effects, in which a recreation of a similar context to that in which the memories were encoded can facilitate their retrieval. Thus, re-hearing the same music associated with the event can activate intensely vivid memories of the event.",
		"We are now imposing ourselves on nature, instead of the other way around. Perhaps the clearest way to see this is to look at changes in the biomass—the total worldwide weight—of mammals. A long time ago, all of us humans together probably weighed only about two-thirds as much as all the bison in North America, and less than one-eighth as much as all the elephants in Africa. But in the Industrial Era our population exploded and we killed bison and elephants at industrial scale and in terrible numbers. The balance shifted greatly as a result. At present, we humans weigh more than 350 times as much as all bison and elephants put together. We weigh over ten times more than all the earth’s wild mammals combined. And if we add in all the mammals we’ve domesticated—cattle, sheep, pigs, horses, and so on—the comparison becomes truly ridiculous: we and our tamed animals now represent 97 percent of the earth’s mammalian biomass. This comparison illustrates a fundamental point: instead of being limited by the environment, we learned to shape it to our own ends.",
		"In the modern world, we look for certainty in uncertain places. We search for order in chaos, the right answer in ambiguity, and conviction in complexity. “We spend far more time and effort on trying to control the world,” best-selling writer Yuval Noah Harari says, “than on trying to understand it.” We look for the easy-to-follow formula. Over time, we lose our ability to interact with the unknown. Our approach reminds me of the classic story of the drunk man searching for his keys under a street lamp at night. He knows he lost his keys somewhere on the dark side of the street but looks for them underneath the lamp, because that’s where the light is. Our yearning for certainty leads us to pursue seemingly safe solutions—by looking for our keys under street lamps. Instead of taking the risky walk into the dark, we stay within our current state, however inferior it may be.",
		"Even the most respectable of all musical institutions, the symphony orchestra, carries inside its DNA the legacy of the hunt. The various instruments in the orchestra can be traced back to these primitive origins—their earliest forms were made either from the animal (horn, hide, gut, bone) or the weapons employed in bringing the animal under control (stick, bow). Are we wrong to hear this history in the music itself, in the formidable aggression and awe­-inspiring assertiveness of those monumental symphonies that remain the core repertoire of the world’s leading orchestras? Listening to Beethoven, Brahms, Mahler, Bruckner, Berlioz, Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich, and other great composers, I can easily summon up images of bands of men starting to chase animals, using sound as a source and symbol of dominance, an expression of the will to predatory power.",
		"Our brains have evolved to remember unexpected events because basic survival depends on the ability to perceive causes and predict effects. If the brain predicts one event and experiences another, the unusualness will be especially interesting and will be encoded accordingly. Neurologist and classroom teacher Judith Willis has claimed that surprise in the classroom is one of the most effective ways of teaching with brain stimulation in mind. If students are exposed to new experiences via demonstrations or through the unexpected enthusiasm of their teachers or peers, they will be much more likely to connect with the information that follows. Willis has written that encouraging active discovery in the classroom allows students to interact with new information, moving it beyond working memory to be processed in the frontal lobe, which is devoted to advanced cognitive functioning. Preference for novelty sets us up for learning by directing attention, providing stimulation to developing perceptual systems, and feeding curious and exploratory behavior.",
		"Psychological research has shown that people naturally divide up cognitive labor, often without thinking about it. Imagine you’re cooking up a special dinner with a friend. You’re a great cook, but your friend is the wine expert, an amateur sommelier. A neighbor drops by and starts telling you both about the terrific new wines being sold at the liquor store just down the street. There are many new wines, so there’s a lot to remember. How hard are you going to try to remember what the neighbor has to say about which wines to buy? Why bother when the information would be better retained by the wine expert sitting next to you? If your friend wasn’t around, you might try harder. After all, it would be good to know what a good wine would be for the evening’s festivities. But your friend, the wine expert, is likely to remember the information without even trying.",
		"Even companies that sell physical products to make profit are forced by their boards and investors to reconsider their underlying motives and to collect as much data as possible from consumers. Supermarkets no longer make all their money selling their produce and manufactured goods. They give you loyalty cards with which they track your purchasing behaviors precisely. Then supermarkets sell this purchasing behavior to marketing analytics companies. The marketing analytics companies perform machine learning procedures, slicing the data in new ways, and resell behavioral data back to product manufacturers as marketing insights. When data and machine learning become currencies of value in a capitalist system, then every company’s natural tendency is to maximize its ability to conduct surveillance on its own customers because the customers are themselves the new value­-creation devices.",
		"The tendency for one purchase to lead to another one has a name: the Diderot Effect. The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases. You can spot this pattern everywhere. You buy a dress and have to get new shoes and earrings to match. You buy a toy for your child and soon find yourself purchasing all of the accessories that go with it. It’s a chain reaction of purchases. Many human behaviors follow this cycle. You often decide what to do next based on what you have just finished doing. Going to the bathroom leads to washing and drying your hands, which reminds you that you need to put the dirty towels in the laundry, so you add laundry detergent to the shopping list, and so on. No behavior happens in isolation. Each action becomes a cue that triggers the next behavior.",
		"While leaders often face enormous pressures to make decisions quickly, premature decisions are the leading cause of decision failure. This is primarily because leaders respond to the superficial issue of a decision rather than taking the time to explore the underlying issues. Bob Carlson is a good example of a leader exercising patience in the face of diverse issues. In the economic downturn of early 2001, Reell Precision Manufacturing faced a 30 percent drop in revenues. Some members of the senior leadership team favored layoffs and some favored salary reductions. While it would have been easy to push for a decision or call for a vote in order to ease the tension of the economic pressures, as co­CEO, Bob Carlson helped the team work together and examine all of the issues. The team finally agreed on salary reductions, knowing that, to the best of their ability, they had thoroughly examined the implications of both possible decisions.",
		"When self‑handicapping, you’re engaging in behaviour that you know will harm your chances of succeeding: you know that you won’t do as well on the test if you go out the night before, but you do it anyway. Why would anyone intentionally harm their chances of success? Well, here’s a possible answer. Say that you do study hard. You go to bed at a decent time and get eight hours of sleep. Then you take the maths test, but don’t do well: you only get a C. What can you conclude about yourself? Probably that you’re just not good at maths, which is a pretty hard blow to your self‑esteem. But if you self‑handicap, you’ll never be in this position because you’re creating a reason for your failure. You were bound to get a C, you can tell yourself, because you went out till 1 a.m. That C doesn’t mean that you’re bad at maths; it just means that you like to party. Self‑handicapping seems like a paradox, because people are deliberately harming their chances of success.",
		"Early in the term, our art professor projected an image of a monk, his back to the viewer, standing on the shore, looking off into a blue sea and an enormous sky. The professor asked the class, “What do you see?” The darkened auditorium was silent. We looked and looked and thought and thought as hard as possible to unearth the hidden meaning, but came up with nothing—we must have missed it. With dramatic exasperation she answered her own question, “It’s a painting of a monk! His back is to us! He is standing near the shore! There’s a blue sea and enormous sky!” Hmm...... why didn’t we see it? So as not to bias us, she’d posed the question without revealing the artist or title of the work. In fact, it was Caspar David Friedrich’s The Monk by the Sea. To better understand your world, consciously acknowledge what you actually see rather than guess at what you think you are supposed to see.",
		"Relativity works as a general mechanism for the mind, in many ways and across many different areas of life. For example, Brian Wansink, author of Mindless Eating, showed that it can also affect our waistlines. We decide how much to eat not simply as a function of how much food we actually consume, but by a comparison to its alternatives. Say we have to choose between three burgers on a menu, at 8, 10, and 12 ounces. We are likely to pick the 10­ounce burger and be perfectly satisfied at the end of the meal. But if our options are instead 10, 12, and 14 ounces, we are likely again to choose the middle one, and again feel equally happy and satisfied with the 12­ounce burger at the end of the meal, even though we ate more, which we did not need in order to get our daily nourishment or in order to feel full.",
		"Philosophical activity is based on the recognition of ignorance. The philosopher’s thirst for knowledge is shown through attempts to find better answers to questions even if those answers are never found. At the same time, a philosopher also knows that being too sure can hinder the discovery of other and better possibilities. In a philosophical dialogue, the participants are aware that there are things they do not know or understand. The goal of the dialogue is to arrive at a conception that one did not know or understand beforehand. In traditional schools, where philosophy is not present, students often work with factual questions, they learn specific content listed in the curriculum, and they are not required to solve philosophical problems. However, we know that awareness of what one does not know can be a good way to acquire knowledge. Knowledge and understanding are developed through thinking and talking. Putting things into words makes things clearer. Therefore, students must not be afraid of saying something wrong or talking without first being sure that they are right.",
		"The most powerful emotional experiences are those that bring joy, inspiration, and the kind of love that makes suffering bearable. These emotional experiences are the result of choices and behaviors that result in our feeling happy. When we look at happiness through a spiritual filter, we realize that it does not mean the absence of pain or heartache. Sitting with a sick or injured child, every parent gets to know the profound joy that bubbles over when a son or daughter begins to heal. This is a simple example of how we can be flooded with happiness that becomes more intense as we contrast it with previous suffering. Experiences such as this go into the chemical archives of the limbic system. Each time you experience true happiness, the stored emotions are activated as you are flooded with even deeper joy than you remembered. Your spiritual genes are, in a sense, your biological treasure map to joy.",
		"Deep­-fried foods are tastier than bland foods, and children and adults develop a taste for such foods. Fatty foods cause the brain to release oxytocin, a powerful hormone with a calming, anti-stress, and relaxing influence, said to be the opposite of adrenaline, into the blood stream; hence the term “comfort foods.” We may even be genetically programmed to eat too much. For thousands of years, food was very scarce. Food, along with salt, carbs, and fat, was hard to get, and the more you got, the better. All of these things are necessary nutrients in the human diet, and when their availability was limited, you could never get too much. People also had to hunt down animals or gather plants for their food, and that took a lot of calories. It’s different these days. We have food at every turn―lots of those fast­-food places and grocery stores with carry­out food. But that ingrained “caveman mentality” says that we can’t ever get too much to eat. So craving for “unhealthy” food may actually be our body’s attempt to stay healthy.",
		"The elements any particular animal needs are relatively predictable. They are predictable based on the past: what an animal’s ancestors needed is likely to be what that animal also needs. Taste preferences, therefore, can be hardwired. Consider sodium (Na). The bodies of terrestrial vertebrates, including those of mammals, tend to have a concentration of sodium nearly fifty times that of the primary producers on land, plants. This is, in part, because vertebrates evolved in the sea and so evolved cells dependent upon the ingredients that were common in the sea, including sodium. To remedy the difference between their needs for sodium and that available in plants, herbivores can eat fifty times more plant material than they otherwise need (and eliminate the excess). Or they can seek out other sources of sodium. The salt taste receptor rewards animals for doing the latter, seeking out salt in order to satisfy their great need.",
		"We might think that our gut instinct is just an inner feeling —a secret interior voice—but in fact it is shaped by a perception of something visible around us, such as a facial expression or a visual inconsistency so fleeting that often we’re not even aware we’ve noticed it. Psychologists now think of this moment as a ‘visual matching game’. So a stressed, rushed or tired person is more likely to resort to this visual matching. When they see a situation in front of them, they quickly match it to a sea of past experiences stored in a mental knowledge bank and then, based on a match, they assign meaning to the information in front of them. The brain then sends a signal to the gut, which has many hundreds of nerve cells. So the visceral feeling we get in the pit of our stomach and the butterflies we feel are a(n) result of our cognitive processing system.",
		"When it comes to climates in the interior areas of continents, mountains play a huge role in stopping the flow of moisture. A great example of this can be seen along the West Coast of the United States. Air moving from the Pacific Ocean toward the land usually has a great deal of moisture in it. When this humid air moves across the land, it encounters the Coast Range Mountains. As the air moves up and over the mountains, it begins to cool, which causes precipitation on the windward side of the mountains. Once the air moves down the opposite side of the mountains (called the leeward side) it has lost a great deal of moisture. The air continues to move and then hits the even higher Sierra Nevada mountain range. This second uplift causes most of the remaining moisture to fall out of the air, so by the time it reaches the leeward side of the Sierras, the air is extremely dry. The result is that much of the state of Nevada is a desert.",
		"One vivid example of how a market mindset can transform and undermine an institution is given by Dan Ariely in his book Predictably Irrational. He tells the story of a day care center in Israel that decided to fine parents who arrived late to pick up their children, in the hope that this would discourage them from doing so. In fact, the exact opposite happened. Before the imposition of fines, parents felt guilty about arriving late, and guilt was effective in ensuring that only a few did so. Once a fine was introduced, it seems that in the minds of the parents the entire scenario was changed from a social contract to a market one. Essentially, they were paying for the center to look after their children after hours. Some parents thought it worth the price, and the rate of late arrivals increased. Significantly, once the center abandoned the fines and went back to the previous arrangement, late arrivals remained at the high level they had reached during the period of the fines.",
		"Around the boss, you will always find people coming across as friends, good subordinates, or even great sympathizers. But some do not truly belong. One day, an incident will blow their cover, and then you will know where they truly belong. When it is all cosy and safe, they will be there, loitering the corridors and fawning at the slightest opportunity. But as soon as difficulties arrive, they are the first to be found missing. And difficult times are the true test of loyalty. Dr. Martin Luther King said, “The ultimate test of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.” And so be careful of friends who are always eager to take from you but reluctant to give back even in their little ways. If they lack the commitment to sail with you through difficult weather, then they are more likely to abandon your ship when it stops.",
		"When you’re driving a car, your memory of how to operate the vehicle comes from one set of brain cells; the memory of how to navigate the streets to get to your destination springs from another set of neurons; the memory of driving rules and following street signs originates from another family of brain cells; and the thoughts and feelings you have about the driving experience itself, including any close calls with other cars, come from yet another group of cells. You do not have conscious awareness of all these separate mental plays and cognitive neural firings, yet they somehow work together in beautiful harmony to synthesize your overall experience. In fact, we don’t even know the real difference between how we remember and how we think. But, we do know they are strongly intertwined. That is why truly improving memory can never simply be about using memory tricks, although they can be helpful in strengthening certain components of memory. Here’s the bottom line: To improve and preserve memory at the cognitive level, you have to work on all functions of your brain.",
		"According to many philosophers, there is a purely logical reason why science will never be able to explain everything. For in order to explain something, whatever it is, we need to invoke something else. But what explains the second thing? To illustrate, recall that Newton explained a diverse range of phenomena using his law of gravity. But what explains the law of gravity itself? If someone asks why all bodies exert a gravitational attraction on each other, what should we tell them? Newton had no answer to this question. In Newtonian science the law of gravity was a fundamental principle: it explained other things, but could not itself be explained. The moral generalizes. However much the science of the future can explain, the explanations it gives will have to make use of certain fundamental laws and principles. Since nothing can explain itself, it follows that at least some of these laws and principles will themselves remain unexplained.",
		"In one example of the important role of laughter in social contexts, Devereux and Ginsburg examined frequency of laughter in matched pairs of strangers or friends who watched a humorous video together compared to those who watched it alone. The time individuals spent laughing was nearly twice as frequent in pairs as when alone. Frequency of laughing was only slightly shorter for friends than strangers. According to Devereux and Ginsburg, laughing with strangers served to create a social bond that made each person in the pair feel comfortable. This explanation is supported by the fact that in their stranger condition, when one person laughed, the other was likely to laugh as well. Interestingly, the three social conditions (alone, paired with a stranger, or paired with a friend) did not differ in their ratings of funniness of the video or of feelings of happiness or anxiousness. This finding implies that their frequency of laughter was not because we find things funnier when we are with others but instead we are using laughter to connect with others.",
		"Followers can be defined by their position as subordinates or by their behavior of going along with leaders’ wishes. But followers also have power to lead. Followers empower leaders as well as vice versa. This has led some leadership analysts like Ronald Heifetz to avoid using the word followers and refer to the others in a power relationship as “citizens” or “constituents.” Heifetz is correct that too simple a view of followers can produce misunderstanding. In modern life, most people wind up being both leaders and followers, and the categories can become quite fluid. Our behavior as followers changes as our objectives change. If I trust your judgment in music more than my own, I may follow your lead on which concert we attend (even though you may be formally my subordinate in position). But if I am an expert on fishing, you may follow my lead on where we fish, regardless of our formal positions or the fact that I followed your lead on concerts yesterday.",
		"Color is an interpretation of wavelengths, one that only exists internally. And it gets stranger, because the wavelengths we’re talking about involve only what we call “visible light”, a spectrum of wavelengths that runs from red to violet. But visible light constitutes only a tiny fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum—less than one ten­-trillionth of it. All the rest of the spectrum—including radio waves, microwaves, X­-rays, gamma rays, cell phone conversations, wi­fi, and so on—all of this is flowing through us right now, and we’re completely unaware of it. This is because we don’t have any specialized biological receptors to pick up on these signals from other parts of the spectrum. The slice of reality that we can see is limited by our biology.",
		"What is unusual about journalism as a profession is its lack of independence. In theory, practitioners in the classic professions, like medicine or the clergy, contain the means of production in their heads and hands, and therefore do not have to work for a company or an employer. They can draw their income directly from their clients or patients. Because the professionals hold knowledge, moreover, their clients are dependent on them. Journalists hold knowledge, but it is not theoretical in nature; one might argue that the public depends on journalists in the same way that patients depend on doctors, but in practice a journalist can serve the public usually only by working for a news organization, which can fire her or him at will. Journalists’ income depends not on the public, but on the employing news organization, which often derives the large majority of its revenue from advertisers.",
		"In most of the world, capitalism and free markets are accepted today as constituting the best system for allocating economic resources and encouraging economic output. Nations have tried other systems, such as socialism and communism, but in many cases they have either switched wholesale to or adopted aspects of free markets. Despite the widespread acceptance of the free­-market system, markets are rarely left entirely free. Government involvement takes many forms, ranging from the enactment and enforcement of laws and regulations to direct participation in the economy through entities like the U.S.’s mortgage agencies. Perhaps the most important form of government involvement, however, comes in the attempts of central banks and national treasuries to control and affect the ups and downs of economic cycles.",
		"It is not the peasant’s goal to produce the highest possible time‐averaged crop yield, averaged over many years. If your time‐averaged yield is marvelously high as a result of the combination of nine great years and one year of crop failure, you will still starve to death in that one year of crop failure before you can look back to congratulate yourself on your great time‐averaged yield. Instead, the peasant’s aim is to make sure to produce a yield above the starvation level in every single year, even though the time‐averaged yield may not be highest. That’s why field scattering may make sense. If you have just one big field, no matter how good it is on the average, you will starve when the inevitable occasional year arrives in which your one field has a low yield. But if you have many different fields, varying independently of each other, then in any given year some of your fields will produce well even when your other fields are producing poorly.",
		"There are several reasons why support may not be effective. One possible reason is that receiving help could be a blow to self‐esteem. A recent study by Christopher Burke and Jessica Goren at Lehigh University examined this possibility. According to the threat to self‐esteem model, help can be perceived as supportive and loving, or it can be seen as threatening if that help is interpreted as implying incompetence. According to Burke and Goren, support is especially likely to be seen as threatening if it is in an area that is self‐relevant or self‐defining—that is, in an area where your own success and achievement are especially important. Receiving help with a self‐relevant task can make you feel bad about yourself, and this can undermine the potential positive effects of the help. For example, if your self‐concept rests, in part, on your great cooking ability, it may be a blow to your ego when a friend helps you prepare a meal for guests because it suggests that you’re not the master chef you thought you were.",
		"As well as making sense of events through narratives, historians in the ancient world established the tradition of history as a(n) source of moral lessons and reflections. The history writing of Livy or Tacitus, for instance, was in part designed to examine the behavior of heroes and villains, meditating on the strengths and weaknesses in the characters of emperors and generals, providing exemplars for the virtuous to imitate or avoid. This continues to be one of the functions of history. French chronicler Jean Froissart said he had written his accounts of chivalrous knights fighting in the Hundred Years’ War “so that brave men should be inspired thereby to follow such examples.” Today, historical studies of Lincoln, Churchill, Gandhi, or Martin Luther King, Jr. perform the same function.",
		"Psychologist Christopher Bryan finds that when we shift our emphasis from behavior to character, people evaluate choices differently. His team was able to cut cheating in half: instead of “Please don’t cheat,” they changed the appeal to “Please don’t be a cheater.” When you’re urged not to cheat, you can do it and still see an ethical person in the mirror. But when you’re told not to be a cheater, the act casts a shadow; immorality is tied to your identity, making the behavior much less attractive. Cheating is an isolated action that gets evaluated with the logic of consequence: Can I get away with it? Being a cheater evokes a sense of self, triggering the logic of appropriateness: What kind of person am I, and who do I want to be? In light of this evidence, Bryan suggests that we should embrace nouns more thoughtfully. “Don’t Drink and Drive” could be rephrased as: “Don’t Be a Drunk Driver.” The same thinking can be applied to originality. When a child draws a picture, instead of calling the artwork creative, we can say “You are creative.”",
		"No learning is possible without an error signal. Organisms only learn when events violate their expectations. In other words, surprise is one of the fundamental drivers of learning. Imagine hearing a series of identical notes, AAAAA. Each note draws out a response in the auditory areas of your brain—but as the notes repeat, those responses progressively decrease. This is called “adaptation,” a deceptively simple phenomenon that shows that your brain is learning to anticipate the next event. Suddenly, the note changes: AAAAA#. Your primary auditory cortex immediately shows a strong surprise reaction: not only does the adaptation fade away, but additional neurons begin to vigorously fire in response to the unexpected sound. And it is not just repetition that leads to adaptation: what matters is whether the notes are predictable. For instance, if you hear an alternating set of notes, such as ABABA, your brain gets used to this alternation, and the activity in your auditory areas again decreases. This time, however, it is an unexpected repetition, such as ABABB, that triggers a surprise response.",
		"The connectedness of the global economic market makes it vulnerable to potential “infection.” A financial failure can make its way from borrowers to banks to insurers, spreading like a flu. However, there are unexpected characteristics when it comes to such infection in the market. Infection can occur even without any contact. A bank might become insolvent even without having any of its investments fail. Fear and uncertainty can be damaging to financial markets, just as cascading failures due to bad investments. If we all woke up tomorrow and believed that Bank X would be insolvent, then it would become insolvent. In fact, it would be enough for us to fear that others believed that Bank X was going to fail, or just to fear our collective fear! We might all even know that Bank X was well-managed with healthy investments, but if we expected others to pull their money out, then we would fear being the last to pull our money out. Financial distress can be self-fulfilling and is a particularly troublesome aspect of financial markets.",
		"Negative numbers are a lot more abstract than positive numbers—you can’t see negative 4 cookies and you certainly can’t eat them—but you can think about them, and you have to, in all aspects of daily life, from debts to contending with freezing temperatures and parking garages. Still, many of us haven’t quite made peace with negative numbers. People have invented all sorts of funny little mental strategies to sidestep the dreaded negative sign. On mutual fund statements, losses (negative numbers) are printed in red or stuck in parentheses with no negative sign to be found. The history books tell us that Julius Caesar was born in 100 B.C., not -100. The underground levels in a parking garage often have designations like B1 and B2. Temperatures are one of the few exceptions: folks do say, especially here in Ithaca, New York, that it’s -5 degrees outside, though even then, many prefer to say 5 below zero. There’s something about that negative sign that just looks so unpleasant.",
		"Observational studies of humans cannot be properly controlled. Humans live different lifestyles and in different environments. Thus, they are insufficiently homogeneous to be suitable experimental subjects. These confounding factors undermine our ability to draw sound causal conclusions from human epidemiological surveys. Confounding factors are variables (known or unknown) that make it difficult for epidemiologists to isolate the effects of the specific variable being studied. For example, Taubes argued that since many people who drink also smoke, researchers have difficulty determining the link between alcohol consumption and cancer. Similarly, researchers in the famous Framingham study identified a significant correlation between coffee drinking and coronary heart disease. However, most of this correlation disappeared once researchers corrected for the fact that many coffee drinkers also smoke. If the confounding factors are known, it is often possible to correct for them. However, if they are unknown, they will undermine the reliability of the causal conclusions we draw from epidemiological surveys.",
		"Free play is nature’s means of teaching children that they are not helpless. In play, away from adults, children really do have control and can practice asserting it. In free play, children learn to make their own decisions, solve their own problems, create and follow rules, and get along with others as equals rather than as obedient or rebellious subordinates. In active outdoor play, children deliberately dose themselves with moderate amounts of fear and they thereby learn how to control not only their bodies, but also their fear. In social play children learn how to negotiate with others, how to please others, and how to manage and overcome the anger that can arise from conflicts. None of these lessons can be taught through verbal means; they can be learned only through experience, which free play provides.",
		"Many early dot‑com investors focused almost entirely on revenue growth instead of net income. Many early dot‑com companies earned most of their revenue from selling advertising space on their Web sites. To boost reported revenue, some sites began exchanging ad space. Company A would put an ad for its Web site on company B’s Web site, and company B would put an ad for its Web site on company A’s Web site. No money ever changed hands, but each company recorded revenue (for the value of the space that it gave up on its site) and expense (for the value of its ad that it placed on the other company’s site). This practice did little to boost net income and resulted in no additional cash inflow ─ but it did boost reported revenue. This practice was quickly put to an end because accountants felt that it did not meet the criteria of the revenue recognition principle.",
		"Scholars of myth have long argued that myth gives structure and meaning to human life; that meaning is amplified when a myth evolves into a world. A virtual world’s ability to fulfill needs grows when lots and lots of people believe in the world. Conversely, a virtual world cannot be long sustained by a mere handful of adherents. Consider the difference between a global sport and a game I invent with my nine friends and play regularly. My game might be a great game, one that is completely immersive, one that consumes all of my group’s time and attention. If its reach is limited to the ten of us, though, then it’s ultimately just a weird hobby, and it has limited social function. For a virtual world to provide lasting, wide‑ranging value, its participants must be a large enough group to be considered a society. When that threshold is reached, psychological value can turn into wide‑ranging social value.",
		"It seems natural to describe certain environmental conditions as ‘extreme’, ‘harsh’, ‘benign’ or ‘stressful’. It may seem obvious when conditions are ‘extreme’: the midday heat of a desert, the cold of an Antarctic winter, the salinity of the Great Salt Lake. But this only means that these conditions are extreme for us, given our particular physiological characteristics and tolerances. To a cactus there is nothing extreme about the desert conditions in which cacti have evolved; nor are the icy lands of Antarctica an extreme environment for penguins. It is lazy and dangerous for the ecologist to assume that all other organisms sense the environment in the way we do. Rather, the ecologist should try to gain a worm’s‑eye or plant’s‑eye view of the environment: to see the world as others see it. Emotive words like harsh and benign, even relativities such as hot and cold, should be used by ecologists only with care.",
		"In the course of his research on business strategy and the environment, Michael Porter noticed a peculiar pattern: Businesses seemed to be profiting from regulation. He also discovered that the stricter regulations were prompting more innovation than the weaker ones. The Dutch flower industry provides an illustration. For many years, the companies producing Holland’s world­-renowned tulips and other cut flowers were also contaminating the country’s water and soil with fertilizers and pesticides. In 1991, the Dutch government adopted a policy designed to cut pesticide use in half by 2000―a goal they ultimately achieved. Facing increasingly strict regulation, greenhouse growers realized they had to develop new methods if they were going to maintain product quality with fewer pesticides. In response, they shifted to a cultivation method that circulates water in closed­-loop systems and grows flowers in a rock wool substrate. The new system not only reduced the pollution released into the environment; it also increased profits by giving companies greater control over growing conditions.",
		"It’s hard to pay more for the speedy but highly skilled person, simply because there’s less effort being observed. Two researchers once did a study in which they asked people how much they would pay for data recovery. They found that people would pay a little more for a greater quantity of rescued data, but what they were most sensitive to was the number of hours the technician worked. When the data recovery took only a few minutes, willingness to pay was low, but when it took more than a week to recover the same amount of data, people were willing to pay much more. Think about it: They were willing to pay more for the slower service with the same outcome. Fundamentally, when we value effort over outcome, we’re paying for incompetence. Although it is actually irrational, we feel more rational, and more comfortable, paying for incompetence.",
		"In adolescence many of us had the experience of falling under the sway of a great book or writer. We became entranced by the novel ideas in the book, and because we were so open to influence, these early encounters with exciting ideas sank deeply into our minds and became part of our own thought processes, affecting us decades after we absorbed them. Such influences enriched our mental landscape, and in fact our intelligence depends on the ability to absorb the lessons and ideas of those who are older and wiser. Just as the body tightens with age, however, so does the mind. And just as our sense of weakness and vulnerability motivated the desire to learn, so does our creeping sense of superiority slowly close us off to new ideas and influences. Some may advocate that we all become more skeptical in the modern world, but in fact a far greater danger comes from the increasing closing of the mind that burdens us as individuals as we get older, and seems to be burdening our culture in general.",
		"Many people look for safety and security in popular thinking. They figure that if a lot of people are doing something, then it must be right. It must be a good idea. If most people accept it, then it probably represents fairness, equality, compassion, and sensitivity, right? Not necessarily. Popular thinking said the earth was the center of the universe, yet Copernicus studied the stars and planets and proved mathematically that the earth and the other planets in our solar system revolved around the sun. Popular thinking said surgery didn’t require clean instruments, yet Joseph Lister studied the high death rates in hospitals and introduced antiseptic practices that immediately saved lives. Popular thinking said that women shouldn’t have the right to vote, yet people like Emmeline Pankhurst and Susan B. Anthony fought for and won that right. We must always remember there is a huge difference between acceptance and intelligence. People may say that there’s safety in numbers, but that’s not always true.",
		"Rebels may think they’re rebels, but clever marketers influence them just like the rest of us. Saying, “Everyone is doing it” may turn some people off from an idea. These people will look for alternatives, which (if cleverly planned) can be exactly what a marketer or persuader wants you to believe. If I want you to consider an idea, and know you strongly reject popular opinion in favor of maintaining your independence and uniqueness, I would present the majority option first, which you would reject in favor of my actual preference. We are often tricked when we try to maintain a position of defiance. People use this reversal to make us “independently” choose an option which suits their purposes. Some brands have taken full effect of our defiance towards the mainstream and positioned themselves as rebels; which has created even stronger brand loyalty.",
		"A typical soap opera creates an abstract world, in which a highly complex web of relationships connects fictional characters that exist first only in the minds of the program’s creators and are then recreated in the minds of the viewer. If you were to think about how much human psychology, law, and even everyday physics the viewer must know in order to follow and speculate about the plot, you would discover it is considerable—at least as much as the knowledge required to follow and speculate about a piece of modern mathematics, and in most cases, much more. Yet viewers follow soap operas with ease. How are they able to cope with such abstraction? Because, of course, the abstraction is built on an extremely familiar framework. The characters in a soap opera and the relationships between them are very much like the real people and relationships we experience every day. The abstraction of a soap opera is only a step removed from the real world. The mental “training” required to follow a soap opera is provided by our everyday lives.",
		"As always happens with natural selection, bats and their prey have been engaged in a life­-or­-death sensory arms race for millions of years. It’s believed that hearing in moths arose specifically in response to the threat of being eaten by bats. (Not all insects can hear.) Over millions of years, moths have evolved the ability to detect sounds at ever higher frequencies, and, as they have, the frequencies of bats’ vocalizations have risen, too. Some moth species have also evolved scales on their wings and a fur­-like coat on their bodies; both act as “acoustic camouflage,” by absorbing sound waves in the frequencies emitted by bats, thereby preventing those sound waves from bouncing back. The B­2 bomber and other “stealth” aircraft have fuselages made of materials that do something similar with radar beams.",
		"Much of human thought is designed to screen out information and to sort the rest into a manageable condition. The inflow of data from our senses could create an overwhelming chaos, especially given the enormous amount of information available in culture and society. Out of all the sensory impressions and possible information, it is vital to find a small amount that is most relevant to our individual needs and to organize that into a usable stock of knowledge. Expectancies accomplish some of this work, helping to screen out information that is irrelevant to what is expected, and focusing our attention on clear contradictions. The processes of learning and memory are marked by a steady elimination of information. People notice only a part of the world around them. Then, only a fraction of what they notice gets processed and stored into memory. And only part of what gets committed to memory can be retrieved.",
		"Coincidence that is statistically impossible seems to us like an irrational event, and some define it as a miracle. But, as Montaigne has said, “the origin of a miracle is in our ignorance, at the level of our knowledge of nature, and not in nature itself.” Glorious miracles have been later on discovered to be obedience to the laws of nature or a technological development that was not widely known at the time. As the German poet, Goethe, phrased it: “Things that are mysterious are not yet miracles.” The miracle assumes the intervention of a “higher power” in its occurrence that is beyond human capability to grasp. Yet there are methodical and simple ways to “cause a miracle” without divine revelation and inspiration. Instead of checking it out, investigating and finding the source of the event, we define it as a miracle. The miracle, then, is the excuse of those who are too lazy to think.",
		"Information encountered after an event can influence subsequent remembering. External information can easily integrate into a witness’s memory, especially if the event was poorly encoded or the memory is from a distant event, in which case time and forgetting have degraded the original memory. With reduced information available in memory with which to confirm the validity of post-event misinformation, it is less likely that this new information will be rejected. Instead, especially when it fits the witness’s current thinking and can be used to create a story that makes sense to him or her, it may be integrated as part of the original experience. This process can be explicit (i.e., the witness knows it is happening), but it is often unconscious. That is, the witness might find himself or herself thinking about the event differently without awareness. Over time, the witness may not even know the source of information that led to the (new) memory. Sources of misinformation in forensic contexts can be encountered anywhere, from discussions with other witnesses to social media searches to multiple interviews with investigators or other legal professionals, and even in court.",
		"Correlations are powerful because the insights they offer are relatively clear. These insights are often covered up when we bring causality back into the picture. For instance, a used-car dealer supplied data to statisticians to predict which of the vehicles available for purchase at an auction were likely to have problems. A correlation analysis showed that orange-colored cars were far less likely to have defects. Even as we read this, we already think about why it might be so: Are orange-colored car owners likely to be car enthusiasts and take better care of their vehicles? Or, is it because orange-colored cars are more noticeable on the road and therefore less likely to be in accidents, so they’re in better condition when resold? Quickly we are caught in a web of competing causal hypotheses. But our attempts to illuminate things this way only make them cloudier. Correlations exist; we can show them mathematically. We can’t easily do the same for causal links. So we would do well to hold off from trying to explain the reason behind the correlations.",
		"Most mice in the wild are eaten or die before their life span of two years is over. They die from external causes, such as disease, starvation, or predators, not due to internal causes, such as aging. That is why nature has made mice to live, on average, for no longer than two years. Now we have arrived at an important point: The average life span of an animal species, or the rate at which it ages, is determined by the average time that this animal species can survive in the wild. That explains why a bat can live to be 30 years old. In contrast to mice, bats can fly, which is why they can escape from danger much faster. Thanks to their wings, bats can also cover longer distances and are better able to find food. Every genetic change in the past that made it possible for a bat to live longer was useful, because bats are much better able than mice to flee from danger, find food, and survive.",
		"Dancers often push themselves to the limits of their physical capabilities. But that push is misguided if it is directed toward accomplishing something physically impossible. For instance, a tall dancer with long feet may wish to perform repetitive vertical jumps to fast music, pointing his feet while in the air and lowering his heels to the floor between jumps. That may be impossible no matter how strong the dancer is. But a short­-footed dancer may have no trouble! Another dancer may be struggling to complete a half-turn in the air. Understanding the connection between a rapid turn rate and the alignment of the body close to the rotation axis tells her how to accomplish her turn successfully. In both of these cases, understanding and working within the constraints imposed by nature and described by physical laws allows dancers to work efficiently, minimizing potential risk of injury.",
		"We must explore the relationship between children’s film production and consumption habits. The term “children’s film” implies ownership by children—their cinema—but films supposedly made for children have always been consumed by audiences of all ages, particularly in commercial cinemas. The considerable crossover in audience composition for children’s films can be shown by the fact that, in 2007, eleven Danish children’s and youth films attracted 59 per cent of theatrical admissions, and in 2014, German children’s films comprised seven out of the top twenty films at the national box office. This phenomenon corresponds with a broader, international embrace of what is seemingly children’s culture among audiences of diverse ages. The old prejudice that children’s film is some other realm, separate from (and forever subordinate to) a more legitimate cinema for adults is not supported by the realities of consumption: children’s film is at the heart of contemporary popular culture.",
		"Beethoven’s drive to create something novel is a reflection of his state of curiosity. Our brains experience a sense of reward when we create something new in the process of exploring something uncertain, such as a musical phrase that we’ve never played or heard before. When our curiosity leads to something novel, the resulting reward brings us a sense of pleasure. A number of investigators have modeled how curiosity influences musical composition. In the case of Beethoven, computer modeling focused on the thirty­-two piano sonatas written after age thirteen revealed that the musical patterns found in all of Beethoven’s music decreased in later sonatas, while novel patterns, including patterns that were unique to a particular sonata, increased. In other words, Beethoven’s music became less predictable over time as his curiosity drove the exploration of new musical ideas. Curiosity is a powerful driver of human creativity.",
		"Technologists are always on the lookout for quantifiable metrics. Measurable inputs to a model are their lifeblood, and like a social scientist, a technologist needs to identify concrete measures, or “proxies,” for assessing progress. This need for quantifiable proxies produces a bias toward measuring things that are easy to quantify. But simple metrics can take us further away from the important goals we really care about, which may require complicated metrics or be extremely difficult, or perhaps impossible, to reduce to any measure. And when we have imperfect or bad proxies, we can easily fall under the illusion that we are solving for a good end without actually making genuine progress toward a worthy solution. The problem of proxies results in technologists frequently substituting what is measurable for what is meaningful. As the saying goes, “Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.”",
		"Languages evolve differences because different groups of people independently develop different words and different pronunciations over the course of time. But the question remains why those diverged languages don’t merge again when formerly separated people spread out and re-contact each other at speech boundaries. For instance, at the modern boundary between Germany and Poland, there are Polish villages near German villages, but the villagers still speak a local variety of either German or of Polish, rather than a mix of German and Polish. Why is that so? Probably the main disadvantage of speaking a mixed language involves a basic function of human language: as soon as you start to speak to someone else, your language serves as an instantly recognizable badge of your group identity. It’s much easier for wartime spies to wear the enemy’s uniform than to imitate convincingly the enemy’s language and pronunciation. People who speak your language are your people, whereas someone speaking a different language is apt to be regarded as a potentially dangerous stranger.",
		"Our craving for relief from feeling helpless is illustrated by a study of religious Israeli women, carried out by anthropologists Richard Sosis and W. Penn Handwerker. During the 2006 Lebanon War the town of Tzfat and its environs in the Galilee region of northern Israel were hit by dozens of rockets daily. Although siren warnings alerted Tzfat residents to protect their own lives by taking refuge in bomb shelters, they could do nothing to protect their houses. Realistically, that threat from the rockets was unpredictable and uncontrollable. Nevertheless, about two-thirds of the women interviewed by Sosis and Handwerker recited psalms every day to cope with the stress of the rocket attacks. When they were asked why they did so, a common reply was that they felt compelled “to do something” as opposed to doing nothing at all. Although reciting psalms does not actually deflect rockets, it did provide the women with a sense of control as they took action in their own way.",
		"Risk management professionals look in the past for information on the so-called worst-case scenario and use it to estimate future risks―this method is called “stress testing.” They take the worst historical recession, the worst war, or the worst point in unemployment as an exact estimate for the worst future outcome. But they never notice the following inconsistency: this so-called worst-case event, when it happened, exceeded the worst case at the time. I have called this mental defect the Lucretius problem, after the Latin poetic philosopher who wrote that the fool believes that the tallest mountain in the world will be equal to the tallest one he has observed. The same can be seen in the Fukushima nuclear reactor, which experienced a huge failure in 2011 when a tsunami struck. It had been built to endure the worst past historical earthquake, with the builders not imagining much worse—and not thinking that the worst past event had to be a surprise, as it had no precedent.",
		"Think of how you developed your style of using the brakes on your car. As you were mastering the skill of taking curves, you gradually learned when to let go of the accelerator and when and how hard to use the brakes. Curves differ, and the variability you experienced while learning ensures that you are now ready to brake at the right time and strength for any curve you encounter. The conditions for learning this skill are ideal, because you receive immediate and unambiguous feedback every time you go around a bend: the mild reward of a comfortable turn or the mild punishment of some difficulty in handling the car if you brake either too hard or not quite hard enough. The situations that face a harbor pilot maneuvering large ships are no less regular, but skill is much more difficult to acquire by sheer experience because of the long delay between actions and their noticeable outcomes. Whether professionals have a chance to develop intuitive expertise depends essentially on the quality and speed of feedback, as well as on sufficient opportunity to practice.",
		"The tight bonds we form with our tools go both ways. Even as our technologies become extensions of ourselves, we become extensions of our technologies. When the carpenter takes his hammer into his hand, he can use that hand to do only what a hammer can do. The hand becomes an implement for pounding and pulling nails. When the soldier puts the binoculars to his eyes, he can see only what the lenses allow him to see. His field of view lengthens, but he becomes blind to what’s nearby. Nietzsche’s experience with his typewriter provides a particularly good illustration of the way technologies exert their influence on us. Not only did the philosopher come to imagine that his typewriter was “a thing like me”; he also sensed that he was becoming a thing like it, that his typewriter was shaping his thoughts.",
		"In the mid-1970s some scientists observed employees of two manufacturing plants in the United States. One plant was located in a large metropolitan area, the other in a rural community with a population of three thousand. On average, the employees had worked at their respective plants for twenty years. Sadly, both plants were scheduled to shut down, and all workers were about to lose their jobs. For months, the men came to work knowing that in only a few weeks they would be unemployed. Anticipating the loss of their workplace was stressful. The anxiety was triggered to a large extent by the uncertainty of what lay ahead. How would they cope with unemployment? Would they find another job? Scientists who followed these workers found that the employees experienced more days of illness before the plants were shut than during the weeks of unemployment that followed. The anxiety induced by anticipating the loss of their jobs damaged their health and well-being. Ironically, once unemployed, the workers became healthier. It’s because the uncertainty of how life would be without a job was removed. Anxiety was reduced, and attention turned to finding a new job, rather than worrying aimlessly about what might be.",
		"In an experiment, researchers monitored college students taking part in a program to improve their skills at studying. They randomly assigned the students to three planning conditions. One group was instructed to make daily plans for what, where, and when to study. Another made similar plans, only month by month instead of day by day. And the third group, the controls, did not make plans. The researchers predicted that the day-by-day plans would work best. But they were wrong. The monthly planning group did the best in terms of improvements in study habits and attitudes. Monthly planners also kept it up much longer than the daily planners, and the continued planning thus was more likely to carry over into their work after the program ended. Why? Daily plans do have the advantage of letting the person know exactly what he or she should be doing at each moment. But their preparation is time-consuming, because it takes much longer to make thirty daily plans than a broad plan for the month without any daily details. Another drawback of daily plans is that they lack flexibility. They deprive the person of the chance to make choices along the way, so the person feels locked into a rigid and grinding sequence of tasks. Life rarely goes exactly according to plan, and so the daily plans can be demoralizing as soon as you fall off schedule. With a monthly plan, you can make adjustments. If a delay arises one day, your plan is still intact.",
		"The true champion recognizes that excellence often flows most smoothly from simplicity, a fact that can get lost in these high-tech days. I used to train with a world-class runner who was constantly hooking himself up to pulse meters and pace keepers. He spent hours collecting data that he thought would help him improve. In fact, a good 25 percent of his athletic time was devoted to externals other than working out. Sports became so complex for him that he forgot how to enjoy himself. Contrast his approach with that of the late Abebe Bikila, the Ethiopian who won the 1960 Olympic Marathon running barefoot. High-tech clothing and digital watches were not part of his world. Abebe Bikila simply ran. Many times in running, and in other areas of life, less is more.",
		"The origins of contemporary Western thought can be traced back to the golden age of ancient Greece, when Greek thinkers laid the foundations for modern Western politics, philosophy, science, and law. Their novel approach was to pursue rational inquiry through adversarial discussion: The best way to evaluate one set of ideas, they decided, was by testing it against another set of ideas. In the political sphere, the result was democracy, in which supporters of rival policies vied for rhetorical supremacy; in philosophy, it led to reasoned arguments and dialogues about the nature of the world; in science, it prompted the construction of competing theories to try to explain natural phenomena; in the field of law, the result was the adversarial legal system. This approach is the foundation for the modern Western way of life, in which politics, commerce, science, and law are all rooted in orderly competition.",
		"I would like to compare the shift from analog to digital film-making to the shift from fresco and tempera to oil painting in the early Renaissance. A painter making a fresco has limited time before the paint dries, and once it has dried, no further changes to the image are possible. Similarly, a traditional filmmaker has limited means of modifying images once they are recorded on film. Medieval tempera painting can be compared to the practice of special effects during the analog period of cinema. A painter working with tempera could modify and rework the image, but the process was painstaking and slow. The switch to oils greatly liberated painters by allowing them to quickly create much larger compositions as well as to modify them as long as necessary. Similarly, by allowing a filmmaker to treat a film image as an oil painting, digital technology redefines what can be done with cinema.",
		"When someone asks us, “How does that work?” or “Why does that happen?” we tend to answer the question directly if we know the answer. After all, it is efficient. Another person asks a question; we provide the answer to the question. It is usually a win-win. The problem with this is that the direct approach can have an unintended consequence: the loss of confidence. Although the question wanted for an explanation, what the asker received was a statement of fact. Why does oil float on top of water in a glass? Relative density. What causes climate change? Increased CO2 in the atmosphere. Why does the ocean have tides? The moon. Giving direct, accurate, and factual answers may seem to solve the problem from the perspective of the answerer. But in reality, it can shut the asker down. A statement of fact with no other context puts the burden on the asker to take the next step. If the asker isn’t familiar with relative density or CO2, he or she is likely to move on rather than ask a follow-up question or probe for related ideas. Any hope of becoming a customer of that idea is lost. This is a failure in the form of a lost opportunity. Although direct answers are often needed and well-placed, they do not work universally. A skilled explainer learns to see the intent behind the question and formulate an answer that focuses on understanding instead of efficiency.",
		"In a penalty situation in soccer, the ball takes less than 0.3 seconds to travel from the player who kicks the ball to the goal. There is not enough time for the goalkeeper to watch the ball’s trajectory. He must make a decision before the ball is kicked. Soccer players who take penalty kicks shoot one third of the time at the middle of the goal, one third of the time at the left, and one third of the time at the right. Surely goalkeepers have spotted this, but what do they do? They dive either to the left or to the right. Rarely do they stay standing in the middle― even though roughly a third of all balls land there. Why would they jeopardize saving these penalties? The simple answer: appearance. It looks more impressive and feels less embarrassing to dive to the wrong side than to freeze on the spot and watch the ball sail past.",
		"Recalling childhood memories can lead people to behave more ethically, according to a study published in April in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. In a series of experiments done by Francesca Gino and Sreedhari Desai of Harvard University, participants were more likely to help the experimenters with an extra task, judge immoral behavior harshly, and donate money to charity when they had actively remembered their childhood. The effect held whether the memories were positive or negative―although, notably, the study subjects did not have traumatic histories. These recollections seem to summon a heightened sense of moral purity. Youngsters may or may not behave especially ethically, but childhood tends to connote innocence―a frame of mind that affects behavior. “It’s promising research in thinking about ways in which people are following their moral compass with very simple interventions,” Gino says.",
		"Hector had always been known as a great shoemaker. In fact, customers from such far­-off places as France claimed that Hector made the best shoes in the world. Yet for years, he had been frustrated with his small shoemaking business. Although Hector knew he was capable of making hundreds of shoes per week, he was averaging just 30 pairs. When a friend asked him why, Hector explained that while he was great at producing shoes, he was a poor salesman―and terrible when it came to collecting payments. Yet he spent most of his time working in these areas of weakness. So, Hector’s friend introduced him to Sergio, an innate salesman and marketer. Just as Hector was known for his craftsmanship, Sergio could close deals and sell. Given the way their strengths complemented one another, Hector and Sergio decided to work together. A year later, this strengths­-based duo was producing, selling, and collecting payment for more than 100 pairs of shoes per week―a more than threefold increase. While this story may seem simplistic, in many cases, aligning yourself with the right task can be this easy. When we’re able to put most of our energy into developing our natural talents, we can achieve our full potential. So, a revision to the “You can be anything you want to be” maxim might be more accurate: You cannot be anything you want to be―but you can be a lot more of who you already are.",
		"Not all interesting discoveries have an obvious application. If you believe you have something, but you’re not sure what exactly it’s going to be good for, don’t give up. Many innovations languished in labs for years until they were matched to a product. Teflon, an extremely slippery synthetic substance employed as a coating on cooking utensils, was invented in 1938, but it didn’t coat its first pan till 1954. The Post-it note was built on the back of some not-very-good glue. Its inventor believed it might have value, but it took him five years to find a potentially profitable use for it. HP had a breakthrough with a super-accurate thermometer that was created in the HP Labs. Despite its accuracy, there was no clear use for the device until it was used to measure fluctuations in ocean temperature.",
		"Empathy is a character trait that we value in ourselves and in our friends, colleagues, and the professionals who serve us. The know-how to be empathetic is central to practical wisdom: unless we can understand how others think and feel, it’s difficult to know the right thing to do. But empathy has its dark side: too much understanding and sensitivity, too much seeing things from the other’s perspective, can cloud judgment and paralyze choice. Edmund Pellegrino, a scholar of bioethics, explains it like this: “If a physician identifies too closely as co-sufferer with the patient, she loses the objectivity essential to the most precise assessment of what is wrong, of what can be done, and of what should be done to meet those needs. Excessive co-suffering also impedes and may even paralyze the physician into a state of inaction.”",
		"Bees have their choice of flora according to color. Lord Avenbury once made an experiment to see if the color of flowers attracted bees. Placing honey on slips of paper of different shades, he found that the insects which visited them seemed to have a marked preference for blue, after which came white, yellow, red, green and orange. This finding should be considered for our beekeeping planning. If pollination is the prime consideration of taming bees and if the crop is identified, the color of other floras nearby should be considered while planning. Let us consider beekeeping near a mustard field. Mustard gives tiny yellow flowers full of nectar and pollen. For better yield of mustard seeds, pollination is necessary. But if there is plenty of blue-colored wild flora nearby, bees may prefer the blue flowers to mustard. Although we shall get honey and other products, the objective for pollination of mustard may be defeated.",
		"In the mid-1900s, John Kenneth Galbraith shocked the field of economics when he insisted that consumers do not merely participate in the marketplace, they are also the product of the systematic deployment of power throughout society. Within this deployment of power, commercial media ensures that consumers adopt values and beliefs that match the general requirements of the economy. The individual’s participation in mass behavior patterns is not a spontaneous reaction to random forces. Consumers engage in shared patterns of consumption because they live within an economic system that operates as a belief system. It exercises considerable control over the meaning and value of things. When the economy functions as a belief system, it establishes severe limits on a consumer’s free choice. As consumers, our choices are not entirely our own. Our beliefs, values, thoughts, and emotions are highly conditioned to match the needs of the marketplace.",
		"Organisms must compete for resources not only with members of their own species, but with members of other species. When two species use the same resource and the resource is scarce, the species must compete just as if they were members of the same population. One of the two species usually turns out to be better at the competition. If two species eat exactly the same food, for example, one of the two will be better at catching it. Unless something interferes, the inferior competitor loses out and the competitively superior species takes over. When one species eliminates another by outcompeting it, it is called competitive exclusion. Sometimes a competitively superior species is prevented from excluding poorer competitors. Periodic disturbances such as severe storms, battering by drifting logs, or underwater landslides can reduce the population of a dominant competitor and give other species a chance. Furthermore, which species is competitively superior sometimes depends on the conditions. On rocky shores in tropical Hong Kong, for example, foliose (leaf-like) algae are the dominant seaweeds during the relatively cool winter. In the summer heat, these forms die out and are replaced by more resistant encrusting algae. Seasonal variation thus prevents either group from excluding the other, and there is a shifting balance between the competing species.",
		"Fundamental to most moral approaches is the idea that human life has a special dignity and value that is worth preserving even at the expense of self­-interest. From this belief it follows, as Charles Beitz notes in his classic work Political Theory and International Relations, “that there are occasions when we have reasons to disregard the demands of self­-interest by taking a moral point of view towards human affairs.” This requires, says Beitz, that we regard the world and our actions in it from the standpoint of one person among many rather than as a particular person with particular interests. This position requires us to choose courses of action, policies, rules, and institutions on grounds that would be acceptable to any agent who was impartial among competing interests involved.",
		"People who use visualization as a support for cancer treatment and other life­-threatening illnesses have discovered the importance of careful image selection. For example, after Carl’s cancer diagnosis he began visualizing the cancer cells being killed by soldiers. It was only after work with his therapist that he realized this could not be effective for him as he had been a committed pacifist for a long time. His subconscious would not easily welcome a warlike image. He settled on using an image of the cancer cells being rescued from their path of destruction by angels and taken to a place of reeducation where they could become “good” cells. It worked for him, and he is convinced that his belief in the principle and his consistency in practicing it positively supported his medical treatment and cure.",
		"Subjective well­being is at least partly temporary in response to the consumption of new and novel consumer goods. Pleasure has a stable component dependent on the accustomed consumption flows, but it also has a component that is dependent on change. Once the change occurs and the new consumer item becomes a part of the daily consumption bundle, the pleasure of novelty disappears and overall satisfaction returns to the original amount. A new kind of cereal at breakfast will temporarily add to our pleasure, but eventually our enjoyment of breakfast will return to its normal level. Also, as our incomes and material standards rise, so do our expected achievements. The purchase of a second automobile made possible by rising income increases our subjective well­being, but at the same time our aspirations rise and a second car becomes a part of our consumption expectations. The shrinkage in the gap between our expectations and realizations returns our subjective well­being to its normal amount.",
		"When the navigation app on your smartphone is telling you the best route to the airport based on current traffic patterns, how does it know where the traffic is? Navigation systems are tracking your cell phone and the cell phones of thousands of other users of the applications to see how quickly those cell phones move through traffic. If you’re stuck in a traffic jam, your cell phone reports the same GPS coordinates for several minutes; if traffic is moving swiftly, your cell phone moves as quickly as your car and these apps can recommend routes based on that. The quality of the overall system depends crucially on there being a large number of users. In this respect they’re similar to telephones, fax machines, and e­mail: If only one or two people have them, they are not much good―their utility increases with the number of users.",
		"When scientists describe tool use by human beings, it is usually in terms of mechanical tools. This may apply to tools such as a sharpened flint blade or an electric drill. The key point is that the tool is thought of as passive and with a small number of predetermined uses. The digital revolution has begun to change this landscape in a significant way. Tools are now being developed with a general function in mind, but they are not predetermined in their operations. As a result, it is not possible to predict the outcome of their use. For example, the personal computer is designed for the general function of handling and processing information, but exactly how the PC is used is not predetermined. Therefore, for some, it may offer a means of communication; for others, a sophisticated means of managing accounts; and for yet others, an entertainment platform.",
		"The human brain cannot completely comprehend or appreciate all that it encounters in its lifespan. Even if a music lover kept his headphones on for every minute of every day for an entire year, he wouldn’t be able to listen to more than an eighth of all the albums that are released just in the United States in one year. Because we do not possess the capacity to give equal time to every artistic product that might come our way, we must rely on shortcuts. We may look for reviews and ratings of the latest movies before we decide which ones we’d like to see. We often let personal relationships guide our decisions about what art we allow into our lives. Also, we continually rely on the distribution systems through which we experience art ―museums, galleries, radio stations, television networks, etc.―to narrow the field of possibilities for us so that we don’t have to spend all of our energy searching for the next great thing.",
		"Blood pressure has to rise when we get out of bed in the morning, so that there is enough blood flow to the brain to keep us from fainting. When we sit down to read the morning newspaper, it goes down again. There is not a single, ideal level of blood pressure that our body tries to maintain. At the same time, it is obviously not to our benefit for blood pressure to get too low or too high, and there are mechanisms in place to keep it within a limited range. I believe that a similar process occurs with human emotions. It is to people’s advantage to react emotionally to their environments, such that emotions vary from moment to moment. It is also to people’s advantage to have mechanisms in place to keep them away from the emotional extremes. Think, for example, about the last time you experienced a state of happiness. Maybe it was the day you were married, or the day your child was born. You probably experienced a wave of pleasure rushing through your body. Your heart was beating rapidly, your blood pressure went up, and you were short of breath. Now imagine what it would be like to feel this way for an hour, a day, or a week. Sounds exhausting, doesn’t it? Prolonged positive (or negative) emotions might have psychological costs, making it difficult to concentrate and to notice new emotional information.",
		"What does curiosity mean, and why is it so important? We think of curiosity as exploration: being inquisitive, seeking to learn and understand. Some associate curiosity with being nosy. After all, aren’t we being nosy if we are curious about another person, asking personal questions? We believe there is a difference between the two. Nosy people ask questions and proceed to weigh the answers provided. Their intention is not to learn about the other person, but to compare, perhaps wanting to determine who is better or worse. In contrast, true curiosity holds no judgment. It is about exploring and learning with the goal of greater understanding, which is free from setting values. When curious people ask a question, their only intention is to better understand, whether it is another person, an idea, a place, an origin, or anything that creates an interest in further exploration.",
		"We tend not to notice how many creative tasks benefit from constraints because they are built in and have become invisible. For example, almost all popular music is in 4/4 time, four beats in the bar, with the emphasis usually landing on the first beat. Tracks are normally three or four minutes in length, contain a chorus, and so on. These are just a few constraints of many that popular music follows, and yet look at the variation that can be achieved. Many songs break these rules, but they often achieve their effects because there is a rule to break in the first place. Painters, writers, artists, and so on are all influenced by previous styles to various degrees and it’s these previous styles that provide constraints. The very limitations we impose on ourselves can be the seeds of our finest creations.",
		"While we like to think that our habits follow our intentions, it’s possible for intention and habit to be completely reversed. How the habit started in the first place could be a complete accident, but we can then work out our intentions from our behavior, as long as there’s no strong reason for that behavior. Say I take a walk around the park every afternoon and each time I follow a particular route which takes me past a duck pond. When asked why I take this route, I might reply that I like to watch people feeding the ducks. In reality, I just walked that way the first time, completely at random, and saw no reason not to do the same the next day. Now, after the habit is established, I try to come up with a reason and the ducks spring to mind. I end up inferring intention from what was essentially just chance.",
		"About 20 years ago, a delicate seaweed named Caulerpa taxifolia was brought from its native habitat in the Pacific Ocean to a zoo in Germany, where it was used to decorate saltwater aquarium exhibits, a seemingly harmless action. The seaweed was such a success that samples were sent to other institutions, including the Oceanographic Museum in Monaco. Within about five years of its introduction there, an unfortunate accident took place. The seaweed was accidentally flushed into the Mediterranean when exhibit tanks were cleaned. This might seem harmless, but considering it so would ignore the tremendous power of the species to act as biological invaders. Once freed in the Mediterranean, Caulerpa quickly changed its growth pattern and adapted to its new habitat. This may have occurred through a mutation or through hybridization with native seaweeds. Whatever the exact genetic explanation, today Caulerpa grows about six times larger in the Mediterranean than it does in its native Pacific Ocean. Over the past two or three years, Caulerpa has spread to the Adriatic, and it now appears to threaten the entire Mediterranean with its ability to choke out competing seaweeds. It grows on rocks, sand, and mud. It grows so widely and quickly that it blankets competing native seaweeds, excluding them and it appears to be toxic to local animals that feed on seaweeds.",
		"In an increasingly globalized world, literature in translation has an especially important role. Increasingly, writers, readers, and publishers are turning to literature as a bridge between cultures, particularly Western and Arab societies. This growing interest is, in turn, driving a boom in translation. However, not surprisingly perhaps, most translations are from English into other languages, not from another language, such as Arabic, into English. Hence, the huge American market is seen as driving the imbalance. Bookstores in the United States, for example, rarely stock more than Nobel Prize winner Naguib Mahfouz’s Cairo Trilogy, a masterful, realistic account of life in Cairo and of a merchant family in the mid-20th century. Western readers likely know little of Mahfouz’s more experimental work, his political and religious allegories, or his historical dramas. The result is a kind of one-way mirror between America and the rest of the world.",
		"We tend to assume that the way to get more time is to speed up. But speeding up can actually slow us down. Anyone who has ever rushed out of the house only to realize that their keys and wallet are sitting on the kitchen table knows this only too well. And it’s not just our efficiency that is reduced. The quality of the experience suffers too, as we become less aware or ‘mindful.’ Have you ever eaten an entire meal without tasting any of it? Hurrying up doesn’t just give us less time, it can also steal the pleasure and benefit from the time that we do have. For many of us, hurrying is a way of life. Some of us enjoy the thrill that it gives us while others are driven crazy by the constant pressure and feel that their lives are speeding up to an unacceptable degree. Either way, there are almost certainly areas of our life that could be enhanced by a little go-slow behavior.",
		"The audience receives a sound signal entirely through the vibrations generated in the air, whereas in a singer some of the auditory stimulus is conducted to the ear through the singer’s own bones. Since these two ways of transferring sound have quite different relative efficiencies at various frequencies, the overall quality of the sound will be quite different. You have probably experienced this when you have listened to your own voice, as on tape or through a public address system. It is easy to blame the ‘sound of a stranger’ on ‘poor electronics,’ but this is only partly justified. The major effect comes from the fact that you hear yourself differently from the way others hear you. This is one of the main reasons why even the most accomplished singers have to listen to the opinion of coaches and voice teachers as to ‘how they sound,’ whereas no concert violinist would have to do such a thing. To the violinist playing sounds almost exactly the same as it does to someone else standing nearby.",
		"It isn’t going to be easy making changes to the food your children eat, and even the most careful, patient parents will probably find that the little ones will resist at some point and to some degree. The problem is that many of us were forced to eat in a healthy way as children: we learned the hard way. And the temptation to continue with these parental habits with our own children is strong. If you were made to sit at the table until you had cleaned your plate, you are not alone: most of the adult population have suffered this at some point―at school if not at home. Forcing your children to eat, especially if they don’t like what is on the plate, is completely counterproductive. “Sit there until you finish” may be how we learned, and may also be the only way you feel able to achieve your goal, but think about it: the experience of eating a pile of unwanted cabbage until they feel sick is hardly going to make children jump for joy the next time it is served. This strict approach is very old-fashioned, and you may win the battle but you definitely won’t win the war. Delaying puddings used to be thought of as a good idea too, but guess what? That doesn’t work either. “No pudding until you have finished your main course” was the standard line when most parents of today were young and is still commonly used, but it only makes sweet things seem more desirable.",
		"Customers’ needs are usually expressed as high‒level descriptions of the overall quality of a product or service. They are typically stated as adjectives and inherently do not imply a specific benefit to the customer. For instance, customers commonly say they want a product or service to be “reliable,” “effective,” “robust,” “dependable,” or “resilient.” Razor users may want the product to be “durable and strong.” Although these simple statements provide some indication as to what customers are looking for, they have one major drawback. They are imprecise statements open to interpretation and present designers, developers, and engineers with the impossible task of figuring out just what customers really mean by “durable” or “strong.” If engineers faced the task of making a razor more “durable,” would they try to make the blade last longer, resist bending, or withstand constant moisture? Would any of these actions satisfy the customer’s true measure of “durable?”",
		"Many political scientists used to assume that people vote selfishly, choosing the candidate or policy that will benefit them the most. But decades of research on public opinion have led to the conclusion that self‒interest is a weak predictor of policy preferences. Parents of children in public school are not more supportive of government aid to schools than other citizens, and young men subject to the draft are not more opposed to military escalation than men too old to be drafted. Rather, people care about their groups, whether those be racial, regional, or political. The political scientist Don Kinder summarizes the findings like this: “In matters of public opinion, citizens seem to be asking themselves not ‘What’s in it for me?’ but rather ‘What’s in it for my group?’” Political opinions function as badges of social membership. They’re like the array of bumper stickers people put on their cars showing the political causes, universities, and sports teams they support. Our politics is groupish, not selfish.",
		"In a study of complimenting behavior in American English, researchers discovered that one of the most striking features of compliments in American English is the almost total lack of originality. An initial examination of a large corpus revealed surprising repetitiveness in both the object of the compliments and the lexical items used to describe them. On closer investigation, it was discovered that regularities exist on all levels and that compliments are in fact formulas. We may categorize 80% of all compliments in the data as adjectival in that they depend on an adjective for their positive semantic value. In all, some seventy‒two positive adjectives occur in the data. What is striking, however, is that of these seventy‒two adjectives only five (nice, good, beautiful, pretty and great) are used with any frequency. While most adjectives occur only once or twice in the data, these five adjectives occur with such frequency that of all adjectival compliments in the corpus two thirds make use of only five adjectives.",
		"Linda was planning to visit Amy in a distant city, but shortly before she was supposed to arrive, Linda called and canceled. Although Amy felt disappointed, she tried to be understanding. Being polite by not imposing, and respecting Linda’s need for independence, Amy said it was really okay if Linda didn’t come. Linda was very depressed at that time, and she got more depressed. She took Amy’s considerateness as indifference. Amy later felt partly responsible for Linda’s depression because she hadn’t insisted that Linda visit. This confusion was easy to fall into and hard to climb out of because ways of showing caring and indifference are inherently ambiguous. You can be nice to someone either by showing your involvement or by not imposing. And you can be mean by refusing to show involvement―cutting her off―or by imposing―being “inconsiderate.” You can show someone you are angry by shouting at her or refusing to talk to her at all. You can be kind by saying something or by saying nothing. For example, if someone has suffered a misfortune―failed an exam, lost a job, or contracted a disease―you may show sympathy by expressing your concern in words or by deliberately not mentioning it to avoid causing pain by bringing it up. If everyone takes the latter approach, silence becomes a chamber in which the ill, the bereaved and the unemployed are isolated.",
		"Early human societies were nomadic, based on hunting and gathering, and, in a shifting pattern of life in search of new sources of food, qualities such as lightness, portability, and adaptability were dominant criteria. With the evolution of more settled rural societies based on agriculture, other characteristics, other traditions of form appropriate to the new patterns of life, rapidly emerged. It must be emphasized, however, that tradition was not static, but constantly subject to minute variations appropriate to people and their circumstances. Although traditional forms reflected the experience of social groups, specific manifestations could be adapted in various minute and subtle ways to suit individual users’ needs. A chair could keep its basic, accepted characteristics while still being closely shaped in detail to the physique and proportions of a specific person. This basic principle of allowed a customization constant stream of incremental modifications to be introduced, which, if demonstrated by experience to be advantageous, could be integrated back into the mainstream of tradition.",
		"Investigators as a personality type place a high value on science, process, and learning. They excel at research, using logic and the information gained through their senses to conquer complex problems. Nothing thrills them more than a “big find.” Intellectual, introspective, and exceedingly detail-oriented, investigators are happiest when they’re using their brain power to pursue what they deem as a worthy outcome. They prefer to march to their own beat, and they dislike overly structured environments that necessitate a set response to challenges. Investigators are not interested in leadership, and developing the interpersonal skills necessary to fuel collaboration is a hurdle for many of them. They may feel insecure in their ability to “keep up” in their fields and can react badly when forced to put more important work on hold to complete a task that doesn’t intrigue them.",
		"It is easy to find examples of correlations which are far more systematic than could occur by chance and yet which it would be absurd to treat as evidence of a direct causal link. For instance, there is a high degree of correlation between shoe size and vocabulary size: people with larger shoe sizes tend to have much larger vocabularies than people with smaller shoe sizes. But having larger feet does not cause anyone to gain a larger vocabulary; nor does having a large vocabulary cause your feet to grow. The obvious explanation of the correlation is that children tend to have much smaller feet than adults, and, because children acquire their vocabularies gradually as they grow older, it is hardly surprising that, on average, people with smaller feet have smaller vocabularies. In other words, foot size and vocabulary size can be explained in terms of features of the process of human development from infancy to adulthood: a cause which both observed phenomena have in common.",
		"True understanding inevitably requires a knowledge of context. The proper way of understanding a beast in a zoo is a telling example. At the zoo, visitors may witness a great beast pacing behind the bars of its cage. They may observe and admire the creature, its amazing bone structure, and its magnificent coat. However, no matter how long visitors spend in front of that cage, they will never truly understand the beast. True understanding can only come from seeing the creature in its natural surroundings and, in turn, the ways in which its presence affects its environment. What is true of the mysterious beast in the zoo is also true of science. To fully understand science, it must be considered within the society in which it functions. Science is not conducted in a vacuum. It is embedded within a social fabric, and just as a flesh-and-blood beast influences and is influenced by its environment, so too do science and society mutually influence one another. Society, through ethical and economic constraints, exerts a powerful influence on what science accomplishes. At the same time, the results of science have profound, and sometimes unexpected, impacts on every human being on earth. Therefore, to make sense of science-related issues, it is critical to recognize the bidirectional relationship between science and society.",
		"The idea that artists have a unique message to communicate is only a few hundred years old. For most of European history, artists were considered primarily craftsmen. When a noble contracted with a painter for a work, the contract specified details like the quantities of gold and blue paint to appear in the work, the deadline, and penalties for delays. A contract in 1485 between the painter Domenico Ghirlandaio and a client specified that Ghirlandaio would “colour the panel at his own expense with good colours and with powdered gold on such ornaments as demand it ...... and the blue must be ultramarine of the value about four florins per ounce”. In some contracts, artists were paid by the time worked rather than a fixed price for the completed work. These contract details show us that art was considered to be a trade ― a very different concept of the artist than we hold today.",
		"Dependency never goes away; it just becomes more subtle and systemic. Without someone to feed us, change our diapers, or carry us from place to place, we would never survive to grow up. Later, all these forms of help fade into the background. They no longer look like mommy and daddy putting the spoon in our mouths. They look like the supermarket, the restaurant, the sewer system, the electrical grid, running water, and the emergency room. Help becomes pervasive and invisible, but it’s still there. For every one thing we think we have done on our own, there are a dozen things that had to be provided for us by others. We live in a dense fabric of mutual aid. That’s what makes us a social species. Even when we go out to compete in the world for money and praise, we never achieve on our own. We build upon parents, relatives, friends, teachers, and neighbors who helped along the way. Help is to each of us as water is to the fish.",
		"Even bitter rivals seek companionship at times of danger. Birds that in the breeding season fight one another to death over territory may end up in the same flock during migration. I know this tendency firsthand from my fish, each time I redo one of my large tropical aquariums. Many fish, such as cichlids, are quite territorial, displaying with spread fins and chasing one another to keep their corner free of intruders. I clean my tanks out every couple of years, during which time I keep the fish in a barrel. After a few days they are released back into the tank, which by then looks quite different from before. I am always amused at how they suddenly seek out the company of their own kind. Like best buddies, the biggest fighters now swim side by side, exploring their new environment together. Until, of course, they start to feel confident again, and claim a piece of real estate.",
		"It must have been 1975 or 1976, as I think I was twelve or thirteen. I came across a thin book, The Limits to Growth, by a curiously named author, the Club of Rome. Skimming through the book, even though I couldn’t fully understand it, I became very depressed. It said that the world will run out of oil in 1992 or thereabouts. So, even before I turn thirty, I thought, I am supposed to start riding around in horse­-drawn carts and burn wood for heating? The prediction by the Club turned out to be right. We have run out of oil―that is, the oil that was accessible with the technologies of the 1970s. But we are still burning oil in huge quantities because we have become much more efficient in locating and extracting oil from places that were just not accessible forty years ago, especially the deep sea. Technology does not only give us access to formerly inaccessible resources but it expands the definition of what a resource is. Sea waves, formerly only a destructive force to be overcome, have become a major energy resource, thanks to technological development. Coltan used to be a rare mineral of relatively little value until the 1980s. Today, it is one of the most valuable minerals in the world. Tantalum, one of the component elements of coltan, is a key ingredient in the making of parts used for mobile phones and other electronic goods.",
		"It takes time for water to soften a sponge. When you are telling an employee, lawn service worker, your teenager, or anyone else, what it is that you want them to do, you may just have to repeat the order and instructions several times before the receiver really gets what it is you want done. That’s not bad. That’s normal communication lag. Be patient. When you are asking someone a question, in an effort to learn a fact that you feel is important for you to know, but they just don’t seem to be willing to give you an answer, take it as a signal that you need to rephrase your question a little and repeat it again, and again, and again, until finally you are heard and answered.",
		"History is a discipline. It is the art of reconstructing the past. As historian John Tosh writes, “All the resources of scholarship and all the historian’s powers of imagination must be harnessed to the task of bringing the past to life— or resurrecting it.” The past is messy, but historians make sense of the mess by collecting evidence, making meaning of it, and organizing it into some kind of discernible pattern. History is an exciting act of interpretation—taking the facts of the past and weaving them into a compelling narrative. The historian works closely with the stuff that has been left behind—documents, oral testimony, objects—to make the past come alive. As John Arnold has noted, “The sources do not ‘speak for themselves’ and never have done so...... They come alive when the historian reanimates them.”",
		"While there is no denying that exceptional players like Emmitt Smith can put points on the board and enhance team success, new research suggests there is a limit to the benefit top talents bring to a team. Researchers compared the amount of individual talent on teams with the teams’ success, and they found striking examples of more talent hurting the team. The researchers looked at three sports: basketball, soccer, and baseball. In each sport, they calculated both the percentage of top talent on each team and the teams’ success over several years. For both basketball and soccer, they found that top talent did in fact predict team success, but only up to a point. Furthermore, there was not simply a point of diminishing returns with respect to top talent; there was in fact a cost. Basketball and soccer teams with the greatest proportion of elite athletes performed worse than those with more moderate proportions of top level players.",
		"Ta­Nahesi Coates, a senior editor at The Atlantic Monthly, ran a personal blog for years. Coates posts daily on a wide array of subjects: movies, politics, economic inequalities, the Civil War, TV shows, favorite poems, or whether pro football is too dangerous to play. Coates, who is African American, is also well known as an eloquent writer on race, and he posts about that frequently. Yet his blog is amazingly abuse­-free: comments spill into the hundreds without going off the rails. “This is the most hot­-button issue in America, and folks have managed to keep a fairly level head,” he says. The secret is the work Coates puts into his discussion board. Before he was a blogger himself, he’d noticed the terrible comments at his favorite political blogs. Coates realized that negative comments create a loop: they poison the atmosphere, chasing off productive posters. So when he started his own personal blog, he decided to break that loop. The instant he saw something abusive, he’d delete it, banning repeat offenders. Meanwhile, he went out of his way to encourage the smart folks, responding to them personally and publicly, so they’d be encouraged to stay and talk. And Coates was unfailingly polite and courteous himself, to help set community standards. Soon several dozen regular commenters emerged, and they got to know each other, talking as much to each other as to Coates. Their cohesion helped cement the culture of civility even more; anyone today who looks at the blog can quickly tell this community isn’t going to tolerate nastiness.",
		"If we can’t have everything we want today, what do we do? We are forced to make choices. We must choose some goods and services and not others. Sometimes this kind of choosing can be visibly painful. Have you ever watched children in a toy store with a gift certificate in hand? It can take them all day before they make a choice. And instead of bubbling with excitement over the toy they bought, they usually appear frustrated over not being able to walk away with everything! Life is like that. Scarcity governs us. Because we cannot have everything all at once, we are forever forced to make choices. We can use our resources to satisfy only some of our wants, leaving many others unsatisfied.",
		"Establishing protected areas with intact ecosystems is essential for species conservation. It is, however, shortsighted to rely solely on protected areas to preserve biodiversity. Such reliance can create a paradoxical situation in which species and ecosystems inside the protected areas are preserved while the same species and ecosystems outside are allowed to be damaged, which in turn results in the decline of biodiversity within the protected areas. This is due in part to the fact that many species must migrate across protected area boundaries to access resources that the protected area itself cannot provide. In India, for example, tigers leave their protected areas to hunt in the surrounding human-dominated landscape. In general, the smaller the protected area, the more it depends on unprotected neighboring lands for the long-term maintenance of biodiversity. Unprotected areas, including those immediately outside protected areas, are thus crucial to an overall conservation strategy.",
		"Our kitchens owe much to the brilliance of science, and a cook experimenting with mixtures at the stove is often not very different from a chemist in the lab: we add vinegar to red cabbage to fix the color and use baking soda to counteract the acidity of lemon in the cake. It is wrong to suppose, however, that technology is just the appliance of scientific thought. It is something more basic and older than this. Not every culture has had formal science―a form of organized knowledge about the universe that starts with Aristotle in the fourth century BC. The modern scientific method, in which experiments form part of a structured system of hypothesis, experimentation, and analysis is as recent as the seventeenth century; the problem-solving technology of cooking goes back thousands of years. Since the earliest Stone Age humans cut raw food with sharpened flints, we have always used invention to devise better ways to feed ourselves.",
		"The overabundance of available storage capacity makes it easy for us to shift our behavioral default regarding external memory from forgetting to remembering. We save different versions of the documents we are working on to our hard disks. And we store images and music files, on the assumption that perhaps some day we might need them. Storing information has become fantastically convenient, but it’s more than convenience that makes us preserve. The truth is that the economics of storage have made forgetting brutally expensive. Consider digital cameras: When you connect your camera to your computer to upload the images you took onto your hard disk, you are usually given a choice. You can either select which images to upload, or have your computer copy automatically all images from your camera. Reassured perhaps by the soothing idea that one can always go through them later and delete the images one does not like, invariably most people choose the latter option. Economically speaking, this makes sense. Assuming it takes only three seconds for a person to look at an image and decide whether to preserve it or not, and that she values her own time at a current average wage, the “cost” of the time alone that it takes to decide exceeds the cost of storage. With such an abundance of cheap storage, it is simply no longer economical to even decide whether to remember or forget. Forgetting―the three seconds it takes to choose―has become too expensive for people to use.",
		"Once a hand or gripper has been directed to an object by reaching, it can be grasped. Grasping requires that fingers hold an object securely. A secure grip is one in which the object won’t slip or move, especially when displaced by an external force. Your grasp on a hammer, for example, would not be secure if knocking against something caused you to drop it. One precondition of a firm grasp is that the forces applied by the fingers balance each other so as not to disturb the object’s position. The characteristics of an object such as its geometric configuration and mass distribution may demand that some fingers apply greater force than others to maintain stability. The grasp and support forces must also match overall object mass and fragility. An egg requires a more delicate touch than a rock.",
		"What story could be harsher than that of the Great Auk, the large black-and-white seabird that in northern oceans took the ecological place of a penguin? Its tale rises and falls like a Greek tragedy, with island populations savagely destroyed by humans until almost all were gone. Then the very last colony found safety on a special island, one protected from the destruction of humankind by vicious and unpredictable ocean currents. These waters presented no problem to perfectly adapted seagoing birds, but they prevented humans from making any kind of safe landing. After enjoying a few years of comparative safety, disaster of a different kind struck the Great Auk. Volcanic activity caused the island refuge to sink completely beneath the waves, and surviving individuals were forced to find shelter elsewhere. The new island home they chose lacked the benefits of the old in one terrible way. Humans could access it with comparative ease, and they did! Within just a few years the last of this once-plentiful species was entirely eliminated.",
		"It is not hard to see that a strong economy, where opportunities are plentiful and jobs go begging, helps break down social barriers. Biased employers may still dislike hiring members of one group or another, but when nobody else is available, discrimination most often gives way to the basic need to get the work done. The same goes for employees with prejudices about whom they do and do not like working alongside. In the American construction boom of the late 1990s, for example, even the carpenters’ union—long known as a “traditional bastion of white men, a world where a coveted union card was handed down from father to son”—began openly encouraging women, blacks, and Hispanics to join its internship program. At least in the workplace, jobs chasing people obviously does more to promote a fluid society than people chasing jobs.",
		"One remarkable aspect of aboriginal culture is the concept of “totemism,” where the tribal member at birth assumes the soul and identity of a part of nature. This view of the earth and its riches as an intrinsic part of oneself clearly rules out mistreatment of the environment because this would only constitute a destruction of self. Totems are more than objects. They include spiritual rituals, oral histories, and the organization of ceremonial lodges where records of the past travel routes of the soul can be exchanged with others and converted to mythology. The primary motivation is the preservation of tribal myths and a consolidation and sharing of every individual’s origins in nature. The aborigines see their relationship to the environment as a single harmonious continuum, through a hierarchy of totems that connect to their ancestral origins, a cosmology that places them at one with the earth, and behavior patterns that respect ecological balance.",
		"If you increase people’s awareness of time—by placing a big clock in front of them—they do more stuff. Think about how much work you get done on the day before vacation. It makes sense that by getting more done, we’d feel more in control. More than that, it’s one of the great fantasies of time management: If you get more organized, you will get on top. However, that works only in a finite world. We haven’t lived in that world for quite a while. In our infinite world, we will never be able to get on top of everything. When we complete more tasks, more take their place—send more e­mails, get more replies. If we do more as a result of better managing our time, we just become busier.",
		"With the invention of typography, spacing and punctuation solidified from gap and gesture to physical artifact. Punctuation marks, which were used differently from one scribe to another in the manuscript era, became part of the standardized, rule­-bound system of the printed page. The communications scholar Walter Ong has shown how printing converted the word into a visual object precisely located in space: “Alphabet letterpress printing, in which each letter was cast on a separate piece of metal, or type, marked a psychological breakthrough of the first order...... Writing moves words from the sound world to the world of visual space, but print locks words into position in this space.” Typography made text into a thing, a material object with known dimensions and fixed locations.",
		"Adolescents, adults, and old people all report that their worst experiences have taken place in solitude. Almost every activity is more enjoyable with another person around. People are more happy, alert, and cheerful if there are others present, compared to how they feel alone, whether they are working on an assembly line or watching television. But the most depressing condition is not that of working or watching TV alone; the worst moods are reported when one is alone and there is nothing that needs to be done. For people in our studies who live by themselves, Sunday mornings are the lowest part of the week, because with no demands on attention, they are unable to decide what to do. The rest of the week psychic energy is directed by external routines. But what is one to do Sunday morning after breakfast, after having browsed through the papers? For many, the lack of structure of those hours is devastating.",
		"As essayist Nassim Taleb resolved to do something about the stubborn extra pounds he’d been carrying, he considered taking up various sports. However, joggers seemed skinny and unhappy, and tennis players? Oh, so upper­-middle­-class! Swimmers, though, appealed to him with their well­-built, streamlined bodies. He decided to sign up at his local swimming pool. A short while later, he realized that he had been caught by an illusion. Professional swimmers don’t have perfect bodies because they train extensively. Rather, they are good swimmers because of their physiques. Similarly, female models advertise cosmetics and thus, many female consumers believe that these products make them beautiful. But it is not the cosmetics that make these women model­-like. Quite simply, the models are born attractive, and only for this reason are they candidates for cosmetics advertising. As with the swimmers’ bodies, beauty is a factor for selection and not the result. Taleb calls the confusions like the cases above the swimmer’s body illusion.",
		"Microsoft senior research fellow Malcolm Slaney and Cambridge University professor Jason Rentfrow advocated dispensing with physical copies of documents and mail, and all the filing, sorting, and locating that they entail. Computer­-based digital archives are more efficient in terms of storage space, and generally quicker in terms of retrieval. But many of us still find something soothing and satisfying about handling physical objects. Memory is multidimensional, and our memories for objects are based on multiple attributes. Think back to your experience with file folders, the physical kind. You might have had an old beat­-up one that didn’t look like the others and that—quite apart from what was inside it or written on it—evoked your memories of what was in it. Physical objects tend to look different from one another in a way that computer files don’t. All bits are created equal. The same 0s and 1s on your computer that render junk mail also render the magnificent beauty of Mahler’s fifth symphony or Monet’s Water Lilies. In the medium itself, there is nothing that carries a clue to the message. So much so that if you looked at the digital representation of any of these, you would not even know that those zeros and ones were representing images rather than text or music. Information has thus become separated from meaning.",
		"A sleeping mother has the ability to identify the particular cry of her own baby. This is one of the bonding factors that has been forgotten because of the way in which we live today. Typically, there is now only one newborn baby in any family house or apartment, so there is no way to test this ability. In an ancient tribe, however, living in small huts in a tiny village settlement, a mother would have been able to hear any of the babies crying in the night. If she woke up every time one of them screamed for food, she might get no sleep at all. During the course of evolution she became programmed to awake only at the sound of her own particular baby. This sensitivity is still there to this day, even though it is seldom used.",
		"When people try to control situations that are essentially uncontrollable, they are inclined to experience high levels of stress. Thus, suggesting that they need to take active control is bad advice in those situations. What they need to do is to accept that some things are beyond their control. Similarly, teaching people to accept a situation that could readily be changed could be bad advice; sometimes the only way to get what you want is to take active control. Research has shown that when people who feel helpless fail to take control, they experience negative emotional states such as anxiety and depression. Like stress, these negative emotions can damage the immune response. We can see from this that health is not linearly related to control. For optimum health, people should be encouraged to take control to a point but to recognize when further control is impossible.",
		"A good deal of the information stored in working memory is encoded in an auditory form, especially when the information is language based. For example, in an early study by Conrad, adults were shown six-letter sequences, with letters being presented visually, one at a time, at intervals of three-fourths of a second. As soon as the last letter of a sequence had been presented, participants in the study wrote down all six of the letters they had seen, guessing at any letters they couldn’t easily recall. When people recalled letters incorrectly, the letters they said they had seen were more likely to resemble the actual stimuli in terms of how the letters sounded than how they looked. For example, the letter F was “remembered” as the auditorially similar letter S 131 times but as the visually similar letter P only 14 times. Similarly, the letter V was remembered as B 56 times but as X only 5 times.",
		"Even if it is correct to say that we express and represent our thoughts in language, it may be a big mistake to suppose that there are structural similarities between what is doing the representing and what is represented. Robert Stalnaker, in his book Inquiry, suggests an analogy with the representation of numbers: The number 9 can be represented as ‘12—3’ but it does not follow that 12, 3, or subtraction are constituents of the number 9. We could compare a thought and its verbal expression with toothpaste and its ‘expression’ from a tube. That the result of expressing toothpaste is a long, thin, cylinder does not entail that toothpaste itself is long, thin, or cylindrical. Similarly, a thought might get expressed out loud in a statement with a particular linguistic structure. It does not follow that the thought itself has such a structure. Suppose, for example, that I look at a fruit bowl, and think that there is an apple and an orange in that bowl. The objects in front of my eyes include some pieces of fruit and a bowl, but no object corresponding to the word ‘and’ exists either in the world or in my visual image.",
		"Three composers attended a show at the Café Concert des Ambassadeurs. There they heard performances of a song written by one of them and a sketch written by the other two. After the performance, the three refused to pay their bill, telling the owner of the café: ‘You use the products of our labour without paying us for it. So there’s no reason why we should pay for your service’. The case went to court, and the composers won on appeal. The decision extended an existing law on theatrical performances to all musical works and all public performance of those works. This decision created a new category of legal right―the performing right―and with it a new economic relationship between music user and copyright owner. As a result of the decision, these composers and others including music publishers founded a society to enforce and administer their performing rights. In doing so, they established the principle and practice of the collective administration of rights, based on the fact that―with the possible exception of opera performances―it was impossible for a single composer or publisher to monitor every use of his or her work by singers, bands, promoters or, in the twentieth century, broadcasters. Accordingly, the new society was entrusted with the task of monitoring music use, issuing licences to music users, negotiating fees, collecting fees and finally distributing the money raised to the composers and songwriters whose works were adding value to other people’s businesses.",
		"Authenticity is one of the keys to leadership effectiveness. We want realness in the executive suite, in the superintendent’s office, and in our religious leaders. We yearn for leaders who are themselves rather than a copy of someone else. We want leaders who will be fully human with us, men and women who are vulnerable enough to acknowledge their strengths and weaknesses, their gifts and limits, and who are appropriately transparent about their hopes and fears, their motivations and their agendas. We trust leaders who are real, who walk their talk, who act on their core values, and who tell us the truth. We authorize others to lead who author their own life. Those we deem not trustworthy we don’t authorize to lead.",
		"Life is rhythmic, cyclical, and always evolving. It’s difficult not to notice repetition and renewal going on all around you. Just as darkness comes at the end of each day, so also comes the dawn to spread light across the land. Just as plants must die at the end of their life cycle, the seeds they have produced will emerge as new plants in the spring. Understanding the cyclical nature of life will reassure you that difficult times won’t last forever, and you will feel joy and happiness again. The rough times must be endured and taken as they come, but they are not constant, nor do they last forever. There will always be good times and bad, feasts and famines, hot summers and cold winters. Whenever you feel stuck, spiritually dry, or just plain gloomy, take time to remind yourself that change is on its way.",
		"Technology is the basis of many of our metaphors and is important in terms of how we think and how our ideas progress. The use of metaphor and the process of design and the evolution of science and technology are cyclic in the sense that metaphors help to shape technology, and new technology leads to new metaphors. Major changes arise periodically, such as moving from horse­-drawn carriages to motor­-driven vehicles. The initial description of the latter is naturally metaphorical, as in the term “horseless carriage.” The association with the previous technology is both verbal and visual. The early designs of such vehicles show visual evidence of the metaphor, as they retained much of the appearance of horse­-drawn carriages. The horse­-drawn carriage was itself a technological innovation, as were the horseless carriage and later automobiles. We tend to not only base new inventions on old, but also explain and try to understand new inventions in terms of what we already know.",
		"As the new century begins, the competition between cars and crops for cropland is intensifying. Until now, the paving over of cropland has occurred largely in industrial countries, home to four fifths of the world’s 520 million automobiles. But now, more and more farmland is being sacrificed in developing countries with hungry populations, calling into question the future role of the car. Millions of hectares of cropland in the industrial world have been paved over for roads and parking lots. Each U.S. car, for example, requires on average 0.07 hectares of paved land for roads and parking space. For every five cars added to the total number of cars in the U.S., an area the size of a football field is covered with asphalt. More often than not, cropland is paved simply because the flat, well­-drained soils that are well suited for farming are also ideal for building roads. Once paved, land is not easily reclaimed. As environmentalist Rupert Cutler once noted, “Asphalt is the land’s last crop.”",
		"The absence of an audience has affected performers of all types and traditions. Before the era of the phonograph, Hindustani classical musicians not only took inspiration from their listeners but also improvised directly in response to their reactions. The exact sound and shape of the performance, then, was determined in part by the interaction of artist and audience. For those who recorded, one way to compensate was to manufacture an audience, planting enthusiastic listeners in the studio. On an acoustic­era recording of Maujuddin Khan, for example, one can hear a few “plants” shouting “Wah! Wah! Maujuddin Khan!” In a more recent example, I myself was an unwitting plant in a recording session for the rock group Rotoglow. After observing from the control room, I was invited to sit in the studio while the band was recording. Squeezed between the lead guitarist and the drummer, I was sure I was a distraction, and after a few songs I volunteered to return to the other side of the glass. To my surprise, the group insisted that I stay. “You’re a part of this, man!” one of them declared. I hardly acted like a typical rock concertgoer— I sat quietly in a chair, my only actions consisting of taking notes and stuffing my ears with wadded toilet paper. Nevertheless, my presence must have in some way met the band’s need or desire for an audience.",
		"Recent research by Juliet Zhu and J. J. Argo suggests that making subtle changes to the seating arrangements in meetings can have an effect on what people choose to focus their attention on. For example, the study found that circular seating arrangements typically activated people’s need to belong. As a result, they were more likely to focus on the group’s collective objectives and be persuaded by messages and proposals that highlighted group benefits rather than benefits to any one individual. This effect was reversed, however, when the seating arrangement was either angular (think L­-shaped) or square. These seating arrangements tended to activate people’s need for uniqueness. As a result, people were more responsive and reacted more favorably to messages and proposals that were self­-oriented and that allowed them to elevate their individualism.",
		"Much of the communication among chimps, as for animals in general, is too subtle for us to notice. One prime example involved six young chimpanzees being studied in the 1970s at the Delta Primate Research Center. One of them (we’ll call him the “leader”) was introduced alone into an enclosure and shown either a hidden source of food or a stuffed snake. When this chimp was reunited with his fellows outside the enclosure, they quickly resumed their normal activities. There was no readily apparent sign that the leader communicated his important knowledge to the other chimps. Yet, when all six were allowed into the enclosure after the leader had been shown food, the group headed straight for the food. In the “snake” condition, the chimps all entered the enclosure with the fur on their backs spiking up and approached the danger zone with extreme caution, poking at the leaf bed with sticks rather than with their hands. Either the leader chimp had conveyed the information to the others, or they were superbly attuned to his intentions.",
		"Science and technology degrees are rewarding because they are not designed exclusively to get you into a job and keep you there. If you are taking a highly specialized or vocational degree, you may well know what career you are aiming for even before you get to university, but for most science and technology undergraduates university is an adventure in itself; ideas about a career may be in your thoughts, but not completely fixed. This gives you the advantage of knowing that you can develop your career ideas as your course progresses, aware that your degree will be of help to you in many areas of work. It is perhaps with this in mind that science and technology degree programs tend to be wide in scope and flexible in approach. You might go to university to study chemistry and find yourself doing some work within the physics department.",
		"It’s a common practice during creativity seminars to give participants a bag full of materials and then a problem to solve. The materials are usually everyday items. Their use is obvious to all. You are then to use those materials in whatever ways you want to solve the problem; however, there isn’t usually an obvious connection between the items and your problem. For instance, maybe you have to figure out how to create a communication device using a hammer, tape, a hairbrush, and a bag of marbles. Most people have a cognitive bias called functional fixedness that causes them to see objects only in their normal context. The use of the materials in their ordinary way will generally lead to no workable solutions. The really exciting solutions come from overcoming functional fixedness and using these everyday items in new ways. To see the possibilities it is helpful to take the viewpoint that nothing is what you think it is.",
		"A group of researchers designed a study about recycling. Participants were told that they would be evaluating a new brand of scissors. The process required them to rate how good the scissors were at cutting out shapes from a stack of 200 sheets of plain white paper. Half the participants tested the scissors in a room where there weren’t any recycling facilities, only a trash can. The other half completed the task in a room where recycling facilities were available in addition to a regular trash can. The participants were purposely not given any specific instructions about the sizes of the shapes or the amount of paper that they should use in the task. Instead they were simply told to dispose of any scraps in the containers provided. Then they completed a “green attitude” questionnaire that asked them about their beliefs and attitudes toward the environment. The results were quite simply startling. Participants who evaluated the scissors when recycling facilities were available used nearly three times more paper than the group who didn’t have recycling facilities. Interestingly, this increase in the use of resources occurred regardless of how positive the participants’ “green attitudes” were, as measured in the post­-study questionnaire. So this study demonstrated that the presence of paper­-recycling facilities caused people to actually use more paper.",
		"In psychology, a ‘model’ of something should never be taken as an exact copy of the thing being described, but rather as a representation of it. A map of the London Underground, for example, is a representation of the Underground layout that helps us appreciate how it works and where it goes. Of course direction, scale, etc. must be distorted somewhat to make it all fit neatly on the page. A model of memory is also a representation. Based on the evidence available, a model provides us with an analogy of how memory works. Describing memory in terms of ‘stores’ or ‘levels’ or ‘loops’ makes our understanding more concrete, and simply conveys to a reader a(n) approximate idea of how a particular psychologist has attempted to understand and explain the available evidence. These models change as the available evidence changes, so should not be seen as permanent fixtures.",
		"Whenever you feel yourself triggered by a passing thought, emotion, or sensation, you have a simple choice: to identify or get identified. You can observe the thought and “identify” it. Or you can let yourself get caught up in the thought, in other words, “get identified” with it. Naming helps you identify so that you don’t get identified. As you observe your passing thoughts, emotions, and sensations, naming them—Oh, that is my old friend Fear; there goes the Inner Critic—neutralizes their effect on you and helps you to maintain your state of balance and calm. My friend Donna even likes to give humorous names to her reactive emotions such as “Freddy Fear,” “Judge Judy,” and “Anger Annie.” (Humor, incidentally, can be a great ally in helping you regain perspective from the balcony.) As soon as you name the character in the play, you distance yourself from him or her.",
		"Here’s something I learned growing up in a military family and living overseas as a child. Being in environments where people did not look like me or even speak the same language as me forced me out of the comfort zone of obvious similarities. When you walk out of your house knowing that most of the people on your street speak a different language, you can either get hung up on that fact or you can open your eyes and begin to notice the larger human commonalities you share. Perhaps your nationality and language and culture and skin color are not the same, but your love of family and strawberries and holiday traditions are undeniably alike. It was a training ground for spotting commonalities. And there began my intrigue with cultures and language and people. Over-focusing on differences narrows your influence. But when you focus on commonalities, your influence grows.",
		"Have you ever found yourself speaking to someone at length only to realize they haven’t heard a single thing you’ve said? As remarkable as our ability to see or hear is our capacity to disregard. This capacity, along with the inherent need to pay attention to something, has dictated the development of the attention industries. Every instant of every day we are overloaded with information. In fact, all complex organisms, especially those with brains, suffer from information overload. Our eyes and ears receive lights and sounds across the spectrums of visible and audible wavelengths. All told, every second, our senses transmit an estimated 11 million bits of information to our poor brains, as if a giant fiber-optic cable were plugged directly into them, firing information at full speed. In light of this, it is rather incredible that we are even capable of boredom. Fortunately, we have a valve by which to turn the flow on or off at will. To use another term, we can both “tune in” and “tune out.” When we shut the valve, we ignore almost everything, while focusing on just one discrete stream of information out of the millions of bits coming in. In fact, we can even shut out everything external to us, and concentrate on an internal dialogue, as when we are “lost in thought.” This ability—to block out most everything, and focus—is what neuroscientists and psychologists refer to as paying attention.",
		"Interest in extremely long periods of time sets geology and astronomy apart from other sciences. Geologists think in terms of billions of years for the age of Earth and its oldest rocks―numbers that, like the national debt, are not easily comprehended. Nevertheless, the time scales of geological activity are important for environmental geologists because they provide a way to measure human impacts on the natural world. For example, we would like to know the rate of natural soil formation from solid rock to determine whether topsoil erosion from agriculture is too great. Likewise, understanding how climate has changed over millions of years is vital to properly assess current global warming trends. Clues to past environmental change are well preserved in many different kinds of rocks.",
		"Politics cannot be suppressed, whichever policy process is employed and however sensitive and respectful of differences it might be. In other words, there is no end to politics. It is wrong to think that proper institutions, knowledge, methods of consultation, or participatory mechanisms can make disagreement go away. Theories of all sorts promote the view that there are ways by which disagreement can be processed or managed so as to make it disappear. The assumption behind those theories is that disagreement is wrong and consensus is the desirable state of things. In fact, consensus rarely comes without some forms of subtle coercion and the absence of fear in expressing a disagreement is a source of genuine freedom. Debates cause disagreements to evolve, often for the better, but a positively evolving debate does not have to equal a reduction in disagreement. The suppression of disagreement should never be made into a goal in political deliberation. A defense is required against any suggestion that political disagreement is not the normal state of things.",
		"To make plans for the future, the brain must have an ability to take certain elements of prior experiences and reconfigure them in a way that does not copy any actual past experience or present reality exactly. To accomplish that, the organism must go beyond the mere ability to form internal representations, the models of the world outside. It must acquire the ability to manipulate and transform these models. We can argue that tool-making, one of the fundamental distinguishing features of primate cognition, depends on this ability, since a tool does not exist in a ready-made form in the natural environment and has to be imagined in order to be made. The neural machinery for creating and holding ‘images of the future’ was a necessary prerequisite for tool-making, and thus for launching human civilization.",
		"Since life began in the oceans, most life, including freshwater life, has a chemical composition more like the ocean than fresh water. It appears that most freshwater life did not originate in fresh water, but is secondarily adapted, having passed from ocean to land and then back again to fresh water. As improbable as this may seem, the bodily fluids of aquatic animals show a strong similarity to oceans, and indeed, most studies of ion balance in freshwater physiology document the complex regulatory mechanisms by which fish, amphibians and invertebrates attempt to maintain an inner ocean in spite of surrounding fresh water. It is these sorts of unexpected complexities and apparent contradictions that make ecology so interesting. The idea of a fish in a freshwater lake struggling to accumulate salts inside its body to mimic the ocean reminds one of the other great contradiction of the biosphere: plants are bathed in an atmosphere composed of roughly three-quarters nitrogen, yet their growth is frequently restricted by lack of nitrogen.",
		"According to many sociologists, the study of what our society calls ‘art’ can only really progress if we drop the highly specific and ideologically loaded terminology of ‘art’, ‘artworks’ and ‘artists’, and replace these with the more neutral and less historically specific terms ‘cultural forms’, ‘cultural products’ and ‘cultural producers’. These cultural products―be they paintings, sculptures, forms of music or whatever―should be regarded as being made by certain types of cultural producer, and as being used by particular groups of people in particular ways in specific social contexts. By using the more neutral term ‘cultural products’ for particular objects, and ‘cultural producers’ for the people who make those objects, the sociologist seeks to break with a view that she/he sees as having dominated the study of cultural forms for too long, namely trying to understand everything in terms of the category ‘art’. This is a category that is too limited and context-specific to encompass all the different cultural products that people in different societies make and use. It is a term that is also too loaded to take at face value and to use naively in study of our own society. Since it is in the interests of certain social groups to define some things as ‘art’ and others as not, the very term ‘art’ itself cannot be uncritically used by the sociologist who wishes to understand how and why such labelling processes occur. Quite simply, then, in order to study cultural matters, many sociologists believe one has to reject the terms ‘art’, ‘artwork’ and ‘artist’ as the basis for our analysis. Instead, these terms become important objects of analysis themselves.",
		"In a classic experiment from 1972, participants were divided into two groups. The members of the first group were told that they would receive a small electric shock. In the second group, subjects were told that the risk of this happening was only 50 percent. The researchers measured physical anxiety (heart rate, nervousness, sweating, etc.) shortly before starting. The result was, well, shocking: There was absolutely no difference. Participants in both groups were equally stressed. Next, the researchers announced a series of reductions in the probability of a shock for the second group: from 50 percent to 20 percent, then 10 percent, then 5 percent. The result: still no difference! However, when they declared they would increase the strength of the expected current, both groups’ anxiety levels rose—again, by the same degree. This illustrates that we respond to the expected magnitude of an event, but not to its likelihood.",
		"How can a design innovate successfully? By taking one step at a time, always considering the interaction between the new ideas and the current work practice. Consider the history of the word processor. Originally, everyone used typewriters, and typing became the work model users understood. Early word processors stayed close to the typewriter model. They just provided better typing and better correction. Then word processors introduced cut and paste—metaphors taken from the physical operations of cutting with scissors and pasting with glue, something everyone had to do already. These features were an easy extension of the model. Then word processors introduced multiple buffers and multiple documents open at a time, making it easy to share and transfer text across documents. Then they introduced automatic word­-wrapping and multiple fonts, and desktop publishing was born. Each step was an easy increment over the previous, and each step walked the user community a little further away from the typewriter model.",
		"It is important to understand the distinction between energy and power. While units of energy measure the total quantity of work done, they don’t tell us how fast that work is being accomplished. For example, you could lift a one­-ton rock up the side of a mountain using only a small electric motor and a system of pulleys, but it would take a long time. A more powerful electric motor could do the job faster, while a still more powerful rocket engine could rapidly propel a payload of identical weight to the top of the mountain in a matter of seconds. Power is therefore defined as the rate at which energy is produced or used. Think of it as energy per unit of time. The standard unit of electrical power is the watt (W). The amount of electrical energy a 10W light bulb uses depends on how long it is lit: in one hour, it will use 10Wh of energy. In the same amount of time, a hundred thousand such bulbs would use 1000 kilowatt­-hours (kWh), which equals 1-megawatt­-hour (MWh).",
		"To some participants, the principal value of fair trade lies not in changing the logic of markets but in righting the market’s historic injustices. Unequal terms of trade, protective tariffs, quality standards, and other barriers have long combined to deny farmers in the global South, both small and large, access to profitable consumer markets in the rich nations. At the same time, they watch as their economies are flooded by the dumping of heavily subsidized, impossibly cheap food and consumer products from abroad that undermine their efforts simply to make ends meet. In this view, then, trade justice consists of facilitating access for producers to the Northern markets from which they have traditionally been excluded. This is the stance of many producer groups in the South, some of the Alternative Trading Organizations that work directly with them, some for­-profit businesses engaged in fair trade, and many certifying organizations.",
		"One unspoken truth about creativity―it isn’t about wild talent so much as it is about productivity. To find a few ideas that work, you need to try a lot that don’t. It’s a pure numbers game. Geniuses don’t necessarily have a higher success rate than other creators; they simply do more―and they do a range of different things. They have more successes and more failures. That goes for teams and companies too. It’s impossible to generate a lot of good ideas without also generating a lot of bad ideas. The thing about creativity is that at the outset, you can’t tell which ideas will succeed and which will fail. So the only thing you can do is try to fail faster so that you can move onto the next idea.",
		"Let me spend a moment on the idea of adjusting to another person’s mental orientation. What I mean is this. At any moment, a person has a particular take on what is happening. The person notices this rather than that, and she has feelings and makes judgements about one rather than another aspect of events. If she is hungry, for example, she may notice that a shop is selling groceries; her friend may notice only that it sells newspapers. If she is short of money, she may resent that the fruit is overpriced; meanwhile her friend may feel tempted by some juicy peaches. In one sense the two friends are experiencing the same shop and its contents, but they are having quite different experiences of that shop. A more extreme case arises when one person comprehends things in a peculiar and individual way, for instance, in mistaking the shop for a cinema.",
		"Externalization is the foundation from which many narrative conversations are built. This requires a particular shift in the use of language. Often externalizing conversations involve tracing the influence of the problem in a child’s life over time and how the problem has disempowered the child by limiting his ability to see things in a different light. The counsellor helps the child to change by deconstructing old stories and reconstructing preferred stories about himself and his life. To help the child to develop a new story, the counsellor and child search for times when the problem has not influenced the child or the child’s life and focus on the different ways the child thought, felt and behaved. These exceptions to the problem story help the child create a new and preferred story. As a new and preferred story begins to emerge, it is important to assist the child to hold on to, or stay connected to, the new story.",
		"The narratives that people create to understand their landscapes come to be viewed as marketable entities and a source of income for residents. Landscapes with a strong place identity have an advantage in marketing to tourists, as it is relatively easy to compartmentalize and market their narratives. Such places may have disadvantages as well, however. If place identity is tied to a particular industry, local residents may feel strongly attached to the definitions of place that stem from involvement in that industry, and they may resist losing that identity in favor of one based on a tourism industry. People rooted in landscape may feel strong connections to other community members and may resent the invasion of outsiders who they believe are different and challenge their common identity. Finally, local residents may feel that this process reduces their identities to mere commercial transactions, and they may believe they sacrifice what is unique and special about their place.",
		"An ecosystem that is altered or damaged in some way will be out of balance with the biome for that area. For example, if the local biome is forest, but the trees have been removed from one area, then the ecosystem is out of balance. The natural tendency is for plant species to move into that area, bringing the ecosystem back towards the biome state. The spread of a species into a new area is called colonisation. It can happen naturally only if there are ecologically healthy ecosystems nearby to provide plant seeds. Once the vegetation has started to recover, insects, birds and other animals will travel into the newly regenerated area. These processes of ecological colonisation can be supported by environmental management. For example, we are currently seeing important changes in the way agriculture is carried out in Britain. Rather than just maximising food production, farming is becoming more environmentally friendly, with the support of financial subsidies. This new approach increases biological diversity by conserving hedges and the wildflowers, insects, birds and other animals that live on the land. A proportion of agricultural land is left completely uncultivated so that species can gradually colonise it. This provides a habitat for a wider range of species. Leaving some farmland as set-aside is also a way to decrease overall production when that is economically desirable. Note that set-aside land is more permanent than fallow land, which is usually left for only a year. Colonisation is a slow process, taking place over years or even decades.",
		"One characteristic of people who have achieved peace of mind is their independence. They trust their instincts. Nobody can tell them what to think if their inner voices say otherwise. Brendan O’Regan tells about a doctoral student who placed an ad in an Idaho newspaper asking if anyone within a 300­mile radius had experienced a remission. Twenty­-five people replied. She noticed that many of them were farmer’s wives who had in common a strong faith in their own judgment. When she asked one of her interview subjects how she had felt when the doctor told her she had a terminal illness, the woman simply said, “I figured that was his opinion. We’re used to being told all these things by all these experts from the federal government who come in and look at the soil. They say ‘Don’t plant corn over there because it won’t grow,’ and you plant it and it grows beautifully. So you realize the experts don’t know everything. When the doctor told me I was going to die in six months, I said ‘What does he know, he’s only an expert!’”",
		"So closely is sniffing tied to odor perception that people routinely sniff when they are asked to imagine a smell. Without prompting, they take larger sniffs when imagining pleasant odors and smaller ones when imagining malodors. During visual imagery the eyes explore an imagined scene using the same scan paths made when viewing the actual visual scene. Preventing eye movements during visual imagery—by having people stare at a stationary target— reduces the quality of the image. Smell researcher Noam Sobel found that, similarly, imagined odors were more vivid when people could sniff than when they were wearing nose clips and unable to sniff. Actually sniffing increased the unpleasantness of an imagined bad smell (urine) and increased the pleasantness of a good one (flowers). Sniffing at an imaginary odor isn’t an absent­minded habit—it’s a behavior that improves the mental image we are trying to create.",
		"People change over time, often for the better. Maturity, wisdom, patience, and many other strengths can result from the gradual accumulation of life experiences. But do these qualities have to develop slowly? Researcher Timothy Carey and colleagues recently examined the idea that insights can be shortcuts to positive personal change. They conducted structured interviews with people who had just finished psychotherapy. Reports of aha moments abounded. One interviewee said that he could “visualize the point” at which he changed; another said, “I could actually hear it.” Many of them could identify the moment at which they had their realizations, such as in a swimming pool with a spouse or in a particular meeting with a therapist. Some used familiar metaphors to describe their ahas, such as a light being turned on, a button being pressed, a click, or a “‘ping’ and then it was like I could see things clearly.” Personal growth doesn’t have to be a glacial process. As physician­-author Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., wrote, “A moment’s insight is sometimes worth a life’s experience.”",
		"Renewal and reform always depend on a capacity for going backwards to go forward. Key to this process is a search within one’s own mind for a model according to which reformed practice can be organized. Architects have long appealed to a primitive hut as just such a model. It is a structure thought to provide access as close to the first principles of architecture as it is possible to get, yet traces of this structure exist nowhere other than in the mind’s eye of the architect searching for it. Nonetheless, absence of the primitive hut from physical reality does little to diminish its importance for the renewal of present practices. If a desired (or required) thing resides in paradise, and no current map indicates its location, getting to it will only be possible via dreams and wishes. Reconstructions of it will necessarily be interpretations based on resemblances modeled after a non­existent object forever beyond our reach. Even though it is impossible to get there, returning to paradise nonetheless remains a reasonable destination for the memory, still able, by way of example, to fulfill its promise to the here and now.",
		"Traditionally, systems have been designed and developed from a technology­-centered perspective. Engineers developed the sensors and systems that were needed to perform each function. They then provided a display for each system that informed the operator of how well that particular system was operating or its present status. So, for example, in the aircraft cockpit a separate display was provided for altitude, airspeed, engine temperature, etc. As technology improved, more and more displays were added. People were left with the job of trying to keep pace with the dramatic growth of data created by this process. In the face of changing tasks and situations, the operator is called upon to find, sort, integrate, and process the information that is needed from all that which is available, leading inevitably to an information gap. Unfortunately, the human has certain information processing bottlenecks. People can only pay attention to a certain amount of information at once. As the display of data in these systems is centered around the technologies producing them, it is often scattered and not ideally suited to support human tasks. A considerable amount of additional work is required to find what is needed and extra mental processing is required to calculate the information the operator really wants to know. This inevitably leads to higher than necessary workload and error. Keeping up has become harder and harder to do.",
		"It is important to note that the primary goal of the professional athlete as well as many adults—winning—is far less important to children. In one of our own studies, we found that teams’ won­-lost records had nothing to do with how much young athletes liked their coaches or with their desire to play for the same coaches again. Interestingly, however, success of the team was related to how much the children thought their parents liked their coaches. The children also felt that the won­-lost record influenced how much their coaches liked them. It appears that, even at very young ages, children begin to tune in to the adult emphasis on winning, even though they do not yet share it themselves. What children do share is a desire to have fun!",
		"Sculpture in a public place is the emotional and aesthetic focal point of the elements in the surrounding environment. Any environment is unique with the diversity of its component elements, the connections between them and their appearance as a complete structure. This preliminary structural analysis and acquaintance with the site chosen for the sculpture is compulsory before working on its design; it is a requirement for successful integration in the specific space. The proper understanding of the spatial characteristics of the elements, making up the whole multitude, as well as of the structural links between the constituent elements of this specific microcosm are preconditions for satisfactory design and an adequate sculptural solution. Contrary to the mechanical adding of one more element to the multitude, it is better to “weave” something more into the context of the existing structure.",
		"Typically an individual cannot accurately assess the gains and costs likely to occur in social interactions. Even the intrinsic satisfactions associated with the individual’s own behaviors may turn sour if the other person somehow does the wrong thing. For example, a person may derive intrinsic satisfaction from helping others; so if the recipient reciprocates favor for favor, both intrinsic and extrinsic satisfaction derive from the profitable interaction. However, the recipient may ignore or even resent the good­-intended gesture as patronizing and may verbally abuse the favor doer, thereby increasing the costs, perhaps spoiling the intrinsic satisfaction (gain) of the behavior, and hence leaving the favor doer with a net loss for the interaction. The consequences of interaction can be difficult to foresee because they depend as much on the behavior of others as on oneself.",
		"Audiences appreciate aha moments so much that they also enjoy simply expecting them, even if the moment never comes. Somebody can enjoy a long book or television show that offers no answer for hours and hours if the genre itself promises a resolution. When the popular, mystic television show Lost ended, many fans erupted in indignation that the show-runners failed to resolve the series’ many puzzles. This deprived careful viewers of the final aha moment that they thought they’d been promised. Some people surely felt like they’d wasted weeks, even months, of their lives waiting for answers. But their final disappointment didn’t retroactively change the sincere thrill they’d felt throughout the series. Lost was a monster hit for many years because audiences enjoyed the experience of anticipating answers, even though the writers were just stockpiling riddles without resolutions. Many people will put themselves through quite a bit of anguish if they expect fluent resolution at the end.",
		"Alex Pentland’s Human Dynamics Laboratory at MIT investigated a huge Bank of America call center where the emphasis was on productivity; reducing the average call handle time at that one call center by just 5 percent would save the company $1 million a year. The bank grouped employees into teams of about twenty, but they didn’t interact much, in part because their work was entirely solitary, sitting in a cubicle with a phone and a computer. They were unlikely to run into each other very often anyway because the bank staggered break times in order to keep staffing levels steady. Here was a team that barely justified the term. Yet the members did interact a bit, and when Pentland asked them to wear the sociometric badges for six weeks, he found that the best predictor of team productivity was how much the members interacted in the little time they had, and what he calls “engagement,” the degree to which all team members were involved in the interaction. So Pentland proposed that managers try an experiment: Give a whole twenty­-person team their coffee break at the same time. In a call center of over 3,000 employees, it was easy to shift others’ breaks to maintain service. The result was that group members interacted more, though it still wasn’t much; more of them were involved in the interaction; and productivity rocketed. The effects were so clear that the bank switched to team­-based breaks at all its call centers, estimating the move would save $15 million a year.",
		"Hardly any discovery is possible without making use of knowledge gained by others. The vast store of scientific knowledge which is today available could never have been built up if scientists did not pool their contributions. The publication of experimental results and observations so that they are available to others and open to criticism is one of the fundamental principles on which modern science is based. Secrecy is contrary to the best interests and spirit of science. It prevents the individual from contributing to further progress; it usually means that he or his employer is trying to exploit for their own gain some advance made by building on the knowledge which others have freely given. Much research is carried out in secret in industry and in government war departments. This seems to be inevitable in the world as it is today, but it is nevertheless wrong in principle. Ideally, freedom to publish should be a basic right of all research workers.",
		"Hands are in fact used for typing in two senses of the word: We use fingers to write words with keyboards, and we also use them as input for social classification. We can often tell what type of person we are viewing by looking at his or her hands. In this way, hands communicate identity. Consider gender. One’s hands can indicate whether a person is masculine or feminine by use of culturally specific gender markers such as long nails, nail polish, or gendered jewelry. In India, henna paintings are made on the hands of a bride who is about to be married. In many cultures, a ring indicates marital status. Rings may also indicate personal interests, taste, and subculture. A skull ring may say “rocker,” a class ring may say “college graduate,” and a cross on one’s ring may say “Christian.” Ostentatiously jeweled rings can also convey financial wealth.",
		"It’s a well-known fact that the food industry uses colors such as synthetic beta-carotene (an orange-yellow dye) in an attempt to manipulate customer behavior. Take margarine, for example: Its natural color is really more of a white, and its taste is oilier than that of yellow butter. The addition of beta-carotene makes margarine look more like butter, and it appears creamier than it really is. The “margarine question” goes back surprisingly far. In 1895, C. Petersen gave a lecture with that title at the general meeting of the Association of the German Dairy Industry in Berlin, which included a comment about the color of margarine. “We’ll have to raise the question as to why margarine is dyed the color of butter, and the only possible answer to that question is because it is believed that it will make people think that they are in fact consuming butter.” And even if this addition of color was presented as harmless, he added, it was still done “for the purpose of deception.”",
		"Automaticity works because it’s fast. All we need to do is hold an image in our mind, and our automated motor plan will run off smoothly. But we, because we’re clever and think we know better, don’t let it. We interfere, by thinking. We think in words, and we can only process words slowly, so all we achieve is that we disrupt our automaticity. We allow our conscious mind (us) to dominate our subconscious mind (our habits and automated motor plans), trying to force our body through movements it doesn’t want to make. We do this because we’ve read books on technique and believe we know all the best angles, positions, and movements. But a better plan would be to allow our subconscious mind, which does know the best way to move, to get on with moving. Once we’ve automated a skill, we can only damage it by thinking.",
		"We are accustomed to thinking of light as always going in straight lines. But it doesn’t. This is manifest when you view a mirage on a long straight highway on a hot day. The road looks wet way up ahead because light from the sky refracts, bending as it crosses the many successive layers of warm air near the surface of the road, until it heads back up to your eye. The French mathematician Pierre de Fermat showed another way to understand this phenomenon. Light travels faster in warmer, less dense air than it does in colder air. Because the warmest air is near the surface, the light takes less time to get to your eye if it travels down near the ground and then returns up to your eye than it would if it came directly in a straight line to your eye. Fermat formulated a principle, which says that, to determine the ultimate path of any light ray, you simply need to examine all possible paths from A to B and find the one that takes the least time. This makes it sound as if light has intentionality, and I resisted the temptation to say light considers all paths and chooses the one that takes the least time. This is because I fully expect that my online opponent Deepak Chopra would later quote me as implying that light has consciousness. Light does not have consciousness, but the mathematical result makes it appear as if light chooses the shortest distance.",
		"Although prices in most retail outlets are set by the retailer, this does not mean that these prices do not adjust to market forces over time. On any particular day we find that all products have a specific price ticket on them. However, this price may be different from day to day or week to week. The price that the farmer gets from the wholesaler is much more flexible from day to day than the price that the retailer charges consumers. If, for example, bad weather leads to a poor potato crop, then the price that supermarkets have to pay to their wholesalers for potatoes will go up and this will be reflected in the prices they mark on potatoes in their stores. Thus, these prices do reflect the interaction of demand and supply in the wider marketplace for potatoes. Although they do not change in the supermarket from hour to hour to reflect local variations in demand and supply, they do change over time to reflect the underlying conditions of the overall production of and demand for the goods in question.",
		"An individual characteristic that moderates the relationship with behavior is self-efficacy, or a judgment of one’s capability to accomplish a certain level of performance. People who have a high sense of self-efficacy tend to pursue challenging goals that may be outside the reach of the average person. People with a strong sense of self-efficacy, therefore, may be more willing to step outside the culturally prescribed behaviors to attempt tasks or goals for which success is viewed as improbable by the majority of social actors in a setting. For these individuals, culture will have little or no impact on behavior. For example, Australians tend to endorse the “Tall Poppy Syndrome.” This saying suggests that any “poppy” that outgrows the others in a field will get “cut down;” in other words, any overachiever will eventually fail. Interviews and observations suggest that it is the high self-efficacy Australians who step outside this culturally prescribed behavior to actually achieve beyond average.",
		"Theorists of the novel commonly define the genre as a biographical form that came to prominence in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to establish the individual character as a replacement for traditional sources of cultural authority. The novel, Georg Lukács argues, “seeks, by giving form, to uncover and construct the concealed totality of life” in the interiorized life story of its heroes. The typical plot of the novel is the protagonist’s quest for authority within, therefore, when that authority can no longer be discovered outside. By this accounting, there are no objective goals in novels, only the subjective goal of seeking the law that is necessarily created by the individual. The distinctions between crime and heroism, therefore, or between madness and wisdom, become purely subjective ones in a novel, judged by the quality or complexity of the individual’s consciousness.",
		"Rules can be thought of as formal types of game cues. They tell us the structure of the test, that is, what should be accomplished and how we should accomplish it. In this sense, rules create a problem that is artificial yet intelligible. Only within the rules of the game of, say, basketball or baseball do the activities of jump shooting and fielding ground balls make sense and take on value. It is precisely the artificiality created by the rules, the distinctive problem to be solved, that gives sport its special meaning. That is why getting a basketball through a hoop while not using a ladder or pitching a baseball across home plate while standing a certain distance away becomes an important human project. It appears that respecting the rules not only preserves sport but also makes room for the creation of excellence and the emergence of meaning. Engaging in acts that would be considered inconsequential in ordinary life also liberates us a bit, making it possible to explore our capabilities in a protected environment.",
		"Businesses of design and entertainment are essentially competing with one another to predict the consumer’s taste― but also have some ability to influence it through clever marketing plans. In fashion, there is something of a cottage industry to predict which colors will be popular in the next season. This must be done a year or so in advance because of the planning time required to turn around a clothing line. If a group of influential designers decide that brown will be the hot color next year and start manufacturing lots of brown clothes, and they get models to wear brown, and stores begin to display lots of brown in their windows, the public may well begin to comply with the trend. But they’re responding more to the marketing of brown than expressing some deep underlying preference for it. The designer may look like a savant for having “anticipated” the popular color, but if he had picked white or lavender instead, the same process might have unfolded.",
		"A challenge unique to environmental science lies in the dilemmas raised by subjectivity. For example, when you go to the grocery store, the bagger may ask, “Paper or plastic?” How can we know for certain which type of bag has the least environmental impact? There are techniques for determining what harm may come from using the petrochemical benzene to make a plastic bag and from using chlorine to make a paper bag. However, different substances tend to affect the environment differently: benzene may pose more of a risk to people, whereas chlorine may pose a greater risk to organisms in a stream. It is difficult, if not impossible, to decide which is better or worse for the environment overall. There is no single measure of environmental quality. Ultimately, our assessments and our choices involve value judgments and personal opinions.",
		"Risk portfolios explain why people often become original in one part of their lives while remaining quite conventional in others. T. S. Eliot’s landmark work, The Waste Land, has been hailed as one of the twentieth century’s most significant poems. But after publishing it in 1922, Eliot kept his London bank job until 1925, rejecting the idea of embracing professional risk. As the novelist Aldous Huxley noted after paying him an office visit, Eliot was “the most bank­clerky of all bank clerks.” When he finally did leave the position, Eliot still didn’t strike out on his own. He spent the next forty years working for a publishing house to provide stability in his life, writing poetry on the side. As Polaroid founder Edwin Land remarked, “No person could possibly be original in one area unless he were possessed of the emotional and social stability that comes from fixed attitudes in all areas other than the one in which he is being original.”",
		"In her 1850 preface to Wuthering Heights and Agnes Grey, Charlotte Brontë gives a detailed account of the reasons behind her decision to use a male pseudonym. She writes that adopting a masculinized pseudonym was an unsophisticated decision based on a ‘vague impression.’ However, Brontë’s anxieties did not stem from the fear that her gender would block her quest for a publisher. Rather, she worried that her work would be dismissed as typically feminine writing. The Brontë sisters perceived themselves to be rebels, but not because they were breaking into a male­-dominated field. On the contrary, they wanted to distance themselves from the large group of women who were then writing domestic fiction: ‘we veiled our own names......because―without at the time suspecting that our mode of writing and thinking was not what is called feminine......we noticed how critics sometimes use for their chastisement the weapon of personality, and for their reward, a flattery, which is not true praise.’",
		"In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries clockmaking was a vital European technology, and London was at its cutting edge. As a maritime nation, the British were concerned with one problem in particular: they could make clocks that kept very good time as long as they stayed perfectly still but not when they were shaken about, and particularly not on board a rolling ship. If you wanted to sail, it was impossible to keep a precise record of time. And at sea, if you can’t tell the time, you don’t know how far east or west you are. It is relatively easy to calculate latitude―your distance north or south of the equator―by measuring the height of the Sun above the horizon at noon; but this won’t let you calculate longitude―your position east or west. The problem of accurate timekeeping at sea was finally cracked in the middle of the eighteenth century by John Harrison, who invented a clock―a marine chronometer― which could go on precisely telling the time in spite of the constant movement of a ship, thus making it possible for the first time for ships anywhere to establish their longitude. Before a ship set sail, its chronometer would be set to the local time in harbour―for the British this was usually Greenwich. Once at sea, you could then compare the time at Greenwich with the time of noon on board ship, which you fixed by the Sun; the difference between the two times gave you your longitude. There are twenty­-four hours in the day so, as the Earth rotates, every hour the Sun apparently ‘moves’ across the sky one twenty­-fourth of a complete circle of the globe―that is, 15 degrees. If you are three hours behind the time in Greenwich, you are 45 degrees west―in the middle of the Atlantic.",
		"Among the most fascinating natural temperature-regulating behaviors are those of social insects such as bees and ants. These insects are able to maintain a nearly constant temperature in their hives or mounds throughout the year. The constancy of these microclimates depends not just on the location and insulation of the habitat, but on the activity of the insects in the colony. When the surrounding temperature increases, the activity in the hive decreases, which decreases the amount of heat generated by insect metabolism. In fact, many animals decrease their activity in the heat and increase it in the cold, and people who are allowed to choose levels of physical activity in hot or cold environments adjust their workload precisely to body temperature. This behavior serves to avoid both hypothermia and hyperthermia.",
		"Although most people, including Europe’s Muslims, have numerous identities, few of these are politically salient at any moment. It is only when a political issue affects the welfare of those in a particular group that identity assumes importance. For instance, when issues arise that touch on women’s rights, women start to think of gender as their principal identity. Whether such women are American or Iranian or whether they are Catholic or Protestant matters less than the fact that they are women. Similarly, when famine and civil war threaten people in sub-Saharan Africa, many African-Americans are reminded of their kinship with the continent in which their ancestors originated centuries earlier, and they lobby their leaders to provide humanitarian relief. In other words, each issue calls forth somewhat different identities that help explain the political preferences people have regarding those issues.",
		"Food unites as well as distinguishes eaters because what and how one eats forms much of one’s emotional tie to a group identity, be it a nation or an ethnicity. The famous twentieth-century Chinese poet and scholar Lin Yutang remarks, “Our love for fatherland is largely a matter of recollection of the keen sensual pleasure of our childhood. The loyalty to Uncle Sam is the loyalty to American doughnuts, and the loyalty to the Vaterland is the loyalty to Pfannkuchen and Stollen.” Such keen connection between food and national or ethnic identification clearly indicates the truth that cuisine and table narrative occupy a significant place in the training grounds of a community and its civilization, and thus, eating, cooking, and talking about one’s cuisine are vital to a community’s wholeness and continuation. In other words, the destiny of a community depends on how well it nourishes its members.",
		"Modern psychological theory states that the process of understanding is a matter of construction, not reproduction, which means that the process of understanding takes the form of the interpretation of data coming from the outside and generated by our mind. For example, the perception of a moving object as a car is based on an interpretation of incoming data within the framework of our knowledge of the world. While the interpretation of simple objects is usually an uncontrolled process, the interpretation of more complex phenomena, such as interpersonal situations, usually requires active attention and thought. Psychological studies indicate that it is knowledge possessed by the individual that determines which stimuli become the focus of that individual’s attention, what significance he or she assigns to these stimuli, and how they are combined into a larger whole. This subjective world, interpreted in a particular way, is for us the “objective” world; we cannot know any world other than the one we know as a result of our own interpretations.",
		"One of the most satisfactory aspects of using essential oils medicinally and cosmetically is that they enter and leave the body with great efficiency, leaving no toxins behind. The most effective way to use essential oils is not orally, as one might think, but by external application or inhalation. The methods used include body oils, compresses, cosmetic lotions, baths, hair rinses, inhalation (by steam, direct from the bottle or from a tissue), perfumes, room sprays, and a whole range of room methods. Although under supervision the essential oils can be prescribed for oral ingestion, this is in fact their least effective mode of entry because it involves their passing through the digestive system, where they come into contact with digestive juices and other matter which affect their chemistry. This limitation also applies to any chemical medications. The flexibility of medicinal use makes the essential oils of special benefit to patients whose digestive systems have, for whatever reason, been impaired.",
		"Political acts vary in terms of contribution. At one extreme, within limits, votes have equal weight. We are each allowed only one per election contest. But the principle of one person, one vote does not obtain for other kinds of participation. Individuals are free to write as many letters to public officials, work as many hours in campaigns, or join as many political organizations as their time and commitment allow. When it comes to the extent to which the volume of activity can be multiplied, contributions to political campaigns and causes present a special case. Although there are no legal constraints on the number of phone calls a citizen can make to public officials or the number of marches a protester can attend, the fact that there are only twenty­-four hours in a day imposes an implicit ceiling. In contrast, despite some campaign finance laws, there is no upper limit on the number of dollars that a person can contribute.",
		"Morality often expresses itself as a duty to perform an action that advances the interests of another, to the harm of one’s own. However, moral actions usually do not occur in isolation, but rather as part of a generalized system of reciprocity (one that stands at the core of the social order in every human society). This system of reciprocity generates benefits for everyone involved (benefits such as freedom from worry of being robbed). If observance of one’s own duties represents the price of admission into this generalized system of reciprocity, then it seems clear that respecting moral constraints also generates benefits. The primary difference between morality and prudence is simply that, in the latter case, the long­term benefits are secured through one’s own agency, whereas in the former case, they are mediated through the agency of another, namely, the person whose reciprocity is secured thanks to one’s compliance with the moral law.",
		"The dictionary of course is not the last word on the definition of bravery. Philosophers have also advanced explanations of this elusive concept, as have social scientists of all stripes. One of the greatest conceits practiced by research psychologists and other academics is that in studying people we often forget to ask them to personally weigh in on the topics being studied. I’ll give you an example. For decades my colleagues and I have studied happiness and the good life. We know all about how money does and does not affect happiness and how happiness affects health, and we understand how happiness changes across the life cycle. But we have rarely stepped back and taken the time to ask people to define, for themselves, what they consider the good life to be! The same is true of courage. There are studies of how levels of courage differ from nation to nation and of how frequently women experience courage. Still, relatively few people have stopped to ask people what they think courage is.",
		"In the 20th century, average life expectancy in the United States rose by nearly 30 years. The vast majority of that increase is credited to advances in public health, rather than advances in medical care, and legal interventions played a critical role in these advances. For example, requirements that children be vaccinated before they attend school played a central role in reducing occurrence of vaccine­-preventable diseases. Smallpox and polio, which were once feared and deadly diseases, were eliminated from the Western Hemisphere (with smallpox eliminated worldwide), while the number of new measles cases dropped from more than 300,000 in 1950 to fewer than 100 in 2000. Likewise, following the introduction of extensive vehicle and roadway safety laws starting in the mid­1960s, the number of highway deaths decreased from roughly 51,000 in 1966 to 42,000 in 2000, even as the number of miles driven per year increased nearly 300%.",
		"One of the key contributions of critical theorists concerns the production of knowledge. Given that the transmission of knowledge is an integral activity in schools, critical scholars in the field of education have been especially concerned with how knowledge is produced. The scholars argue that a key element of social injustice involves the claim that particular knowledge is objective, neutral, and universal. An approach based on critical theory calls into question the idea that objectivity is desirable or even possible. The term used to describe this way of thinking about knowledge is that knowledge is socially constructed. When we refer to knowledge as socially constructed we mean that knowledge is reflective of the values and interests of those who produce it. This concept captures the understanding that all knowledge and all means of knowing are connected to a social context.",
		"Students of ethics have been perplexed whether to classify their subject as a science, an art, or otherwise. The objection to including ethics among the sciences is that, whereas science deals with what is, ethics, it is said, is concerned with what ought to be. This, at the first glimpse, appears to be a valid and useful distinction; but mature reflection reveals that it is superficial and not wholly true. Much of the confusion and disorientation in contemporary ethics may be traced to just this refusal to recognize that ethics, no less than physics, is concerned with actually existent situations and with energies that cause clearly demonstrable effects. In the first place, our opinion of what ought to be lacks authority if it ignores what already exists. Any one of our most fanciful dreams might with equal force command our present efforts, unless we insist that our notions of what ought to be are somehow related to present realities. Even from this point of view, ethics must be more than the consideration of imaginary states that might satisfy our highest moral aspirations.",
		"At the heart of individualism lies the belief that each individual person constitutes the center of one’s universe. At first glance, this seems to be a view that most people would not openly embrace. We are, after all, frequently told to look out for and care about others. Moreover, no one really likes a person who is obviously self­-centered. However, we all have to admit that the tug toward a self­-centered life is strong, and this tempts us to hide selfish intentions by using the language of unselfishness. If we are honest, we will admit that many things we claim to do sacrificially or just because they are right are exactly the same actions that bring us personal benefit. With a bit of unbiased examination of our motives, it is hard to deny that we have a strong bias toward our individual interests. Thus, despite what we may say to the contrary, it is not hard to make the case that we are more self­-centered than we are willing to admit.",
		"The skeletons found in early farming villages in the Fertile Crescent are usually shorter than those of neighboring foragers, which suggests that their diets were less varied. Though farmers could produce more food, they were also more likely to starve, because, unlike foragers, they relied on a small number of crops, and if those crops failed, they were in serious trouble. The bones of early farmers show evidence of vitamin deficiencies, probably caused by regular periods of starvation between harvests. They also show signs of stress, associated, perhaps, with the intensive labor required for plowing, harvesting crops, felling trees, maintaining buildings and fences, and grinding grains. Villages also produced refuse, which attracted vermin, and their populations were large enough to spread diseases that could not have survived in smaller, more nomadic foraging communities. All this evidence of declining health suggests that the first farmers were pushed into the complex and increasingly interconnected farming lifeway rather than pulled by its advantages.",
		"One study showed that a certain word (e.g., boat) seemed more pleasant when presented after related words (e.g., sea, sail). That result occurred because of conceptual fluency, a type of processing fluency related to how easily information comes to our mind. Because “sea” primed the context, the heightened predictability caused the concept of “boat” to enter people’s minds more easily, and that ease of processing produced a pleasant feeling that became misattributed to the word “boat.” Marketers can take advantage of conceptual fluency and enhance the effectiveness of their advertisements by strategically positioning their ads in predictive contexts. For example, an experiment showed that consumers found a ketchup ad more favorable when the ad was presented after an ad for mayonnaise. The mayonnaise ad primed consumers’ schema for condiments, and when the ad for ketchup was presented afterward, the idea of ketchup came to their minds more easily. As a result of that heightened conceptual fluency, consumers developed a more positive attitude toward the ketchup advertisement.",
		"Any discussion of coevolution quickly runs into what philosophers call a “causality dilemma,” a problem we recognize from the question, “Which came first, the chicken or the egg?” For bees and flowers, we know that both sides arrived at the party well-prepared for dancing. Branched hairs apparently complemented a bee’s taste for pollen from the earliest stage of their evolution. On the botanical side, plants had long been experimenting with insect pollination, attracting dance partners with nectar or edible blossoms. Lack of fossil evidence makes it impossible to run the movie backward and watch the first steps of the dance unfold, but modern studies suggest that plants are often the ones taking the lead. When researchers changed monkeyflowers from pink to orange, for example, pollinator visits shifted from bumblebees to hummingbirds. A similar experiment on South American petunias showed that the flower could trade in bees for hawk moths by altering the activity of a single gene. These findings confirm that relatively simple steps in floral evolution can have dramatic consequences for pollinators.",
		"There is good evidence that the current obesity crisis is caused, in part, not by what we eat (though this is of course vital, too) but by the degree to which our food has been processed before we eat it. It is sometimes referred to as the “Calorie Delusion.” In 2003, scientists at Kyushu University in Japan fed hard food pellets to one group of rats and softer pellets to another group. In every other respect the pellets were identical: same nutrients, same calories. After twenty-two weeks, the rats on the soft-food diet had become obese, showing that texture is an important factor in weight gain. Further studies involving pythons (eating ground cooked steak versus intact raw steak) confirmed these findings. When we eat chewier, less processed foods, it takes us more energy to digest them, so the number of calories our body receives is less. You will get more energy from a slow-cooked apple purée than a crunchy raw apple, even if the calories on paper are identical.",
		"Some people have defined wildlife damage management as the science and management of overabundant species, but this definition is too narrow. All wildlife species act in ways that harm human interests. Thus, all species cause wildlife damage, not just overabundant ones. One interesting example of this involves endangered peregrine falcons in California, which prey on another endangered species, the California least tern. Certainly, we would not consider peregrine falcons as being overabundant, but we wish that they would not feed on an endangered species. In this case, one of the negative values associated with a peregrine falcon population is that its predation reduces the population of another endangered species. The goal of wildlife damage management in this case would be to stop the falcons from eating the terns without harming the falcons.",
		"Through recent decades academic archaeologists have been urged to conduct their research and excavations according to hypothesis-testing procedures. It has been argued that we should construct our general theories, deduce testable propositions and prove or disprove them against the sampled data. In fact, the application of this ‘scientific method’ often ran into difficulties. The data have a tendency to lead to unexpected questions, problems and issues. Thus, archaeologists claiming to follow hypothesis-testing procedures found themselves having to create a fiction. In practice, their work and theoretical conclusions partly developed from the data which they had discovered. In other words, they already knew the data when they decided upon an interpretation. But in presenting their work they rewrote the script, placing the theory first and claiming to have tested it against data which they discovered, as in an experiment under laboratory conditions.",
		"Digital technology accelerates dematerialization by hastening the migration from products to services. The liquid nature of services means they don’t have to be bound to materials. But dematerialization is not just about digital goods. The reason even solid physical goods―like a soda can―can deliver more benefits while inhabiting less material is because their heavy atoms are substituted by weightless bits. The tangible is replaced by intangibles―intangibles like better design, innovative processes, smart chips, and eventually online connectivity―that do the work that more aluminum atoms used to do. Soft things, like intelligence, are thus embedded into hard things, like aluminum, that make hard things behave more like software. Material goods infused with bits increasingly act as if they were intangible services. Nouns morph to verbs. Hardware behaves like software. In Silicon Valley they say it like this: “Software eats everything.”",
		"Not all Golden Rules are alike; two kinds emerged over time. The negative version instructs restraint; the positive encourages intervention. One sets a baseline of at least not causing harm; the other points toward aspirational or idealized beneficent behavior. While examples of these rules abound, too many to list exhaustively, let these versions suffice for our purpose here: “What is hateful to you do not do to another” and “Love another as yourself.” Both versions insist on caring for others, whether through acts of omission, such as not injuring, or through acts of commission, by actively intervening. Yet while these Golden Rules encourage an agent to care for an other, they do not require abandoning self-concern altogether. The purposeful displacement of concern away from the ego nonetheless remains partly self-referential. Both the negative and the positive versions invoke the ego as the fundamental measure against which behaviors are to be evaluated.",
		"A term like social drinker was itself what we might call “socially constructed.” When a social drinker was caught driving drunk, it was seen as a single instance of bad judgment in an otherwise exemplary life, but this was rarely the case. Experts liked to point out that persons caught driving drunk for the first time had probably done so dozens of times before without incident. The language chosen to characterize these particular individuals, however, reflected the forgiving way that society viewed them. The same could be said for the word accident, which was the common term used to describe automobile crashes well into the 1980s. An accident implied an unfortunate act of God, not something that could―or should―be prevented.",
		"Interconnectivity doesn’t mean inclusivity. On the contrary, it may produce a Balkanization of views that harshens political discourse and supports or hardens extremist views. There is little sign that the Internet or social media encourages broadmindedness and debate; in some ways they are set up to insulate us from dissent or challenge, for example, by offering to personalize news feeds. It used to take some effort to find Holocaust­-denying pseudo-history; now it’s one click away. Just as information technologies may serve to amplify existing prejudices and misconceptions, so they amplify inequality. In business and trade, in arts and entertainment and fame, markets have become ever more inclined toward “winner takes all.” This, psychological studies show, is precisely what to expect from rating systems in which you can easily see what choices others are making.",
		"Big corporations feel very evil to us now, the natural targets of blame for low­-paying jobs, environmental abuse and sickening ingredients. But Adam Smith knew there was an unexpected, and more important, element responsible for these ills: our taste. Collectively, it is we, the consumers, who opt for certain kinds of ease and excitement over others. And once that basic fact is in place, everything else follows it. It’s not companies that primarily degrade the world. It is our appetites, which they merely serve. As a result, the reform of capitalism entirely depends on an odd­-sounding, but critical task: the education of the consumer. We need to be taught to want better quality things and pay a proper price for them, one that reflects the true burden on workers and the environment. A good capitalist society doesn’t therefore just offer customers choice, it also spends a considerable part of its energies educating people about how to exercise this choice in judicious ways. Capitalism needs to be saved by elevating the quality of demand.",
		"The author is superficially understood to be the creative, and individual, source of a written text. The idea that there is a unique creator of a text, and that the task of reading is, in consequence, a more or less passive process of recovering his or her intentions and meanings, has been variously challenged. Nineteenth­-century hermeneuticians, notably Wilhelm Dilthey, challenged the assumption that the author had any privileged insight into the meaning of his or her text by critically examining the active process entailed in reading, and thus the need to construct rather than merely to recover meaning from a text. In effect, the author’s self­-understandings are exposed as merely one more interpretation of the text among many others. In aesthetics, criticism of the ‘intentional fallacy’ holds that interpretation of a work of art cannot claim to be definitive or authoritative by having recovered the author’s intentions. Challenging the author’s status thereby pushes aesthetic reflection towards the intrinsic qualities of the artwork or text, and at the extreme undermines the possibility of there being a single, definitive or correct reading.",
		"When you begin to tell a story again that you have retold many times, what you retrieve from memory is the index to the story itself. That index can be embellished in a variety of ways. Over time, even the embellishments become standardized. An old man’s story that he has told hundreds of times shows little variation, and any variation that does exist becomes part of the story itself, regardless of its origin. People add details to their stories that may or may not have occurred. They are recalling indexes and reconstructing details. If at some point they add a nice detail, not really certain of its validity, telling the story with that same detail a few more times will ensure its permanent place in the story index. In other words, the stories we tell time and again are identical to the memory we have of the events that the story relates.",
		"With population growth slowing, the strongest force increasing demand for more agricultural production will be rising incomes, which are desired by practically all governments and individuals. Although richer people spend smaller proportions of their income on food, in total they consume more food―and richer food, which contributes to various kinds of disease and debilitation. The changes in diet that usually accompany higher incomes will require relatively greater increases in the production of feed grains, rather than food grains, as foods of animal origin partly displace plant-based foods in people’s diets. It takes two to six times more grain to produce food value through animals than to get the equivalent value directly from plants. It is thus quite credible to estimate that in order to meet economic and social needs within the next three to five decades, the world should be producing more than twice as much grain and agricultural products as at present, but in ways that these are accessible to the food-insecure.",
		"If one looks at the Oxford definition, one gets the sense that post-truth is not so much a claim that truth does not exist as that facts are subordinate to our political point of view. The Oxford definition focuses on “what” post-truth is: the idea that feelings sometimes matter more than facts. But just as important is the next question, which is why this ever occurs. Someone does not argue against an obvious or easily confirmable fact for no reason; he or she does so when it is to his or her advantage. When a person’s beliefs are threatened by an “inconvenient fact,” sometimes it is preferable to challenge the fact. This can happen at either a conscious or unconscious level (since sometimes the person we are seeking to convince is ourselves), but the point is that this sort of post-truth relationship to facts occurs only when we are seeking to assert something that is more important to us than the truth itself.",
		"The debates between social and cultural anthropologists concern not the differences between the concepts but the analytical priority: which should come first, the social chicken or the cultural egg? British anthropology emphasizes the social. It assumes that social institutions determine culture and that universal domains of society (such as kinship, economy, politics, and religion) are represented by specific institutions (such as the family, subsistence farming, the British Parliament, and the Church of England) which can be compared cross-culturally. American anthropology emphasizes the cultural. It assumes that culture shapes social institutions by providing the shared beliefs, the core values, the communicative tools, and so on that make social life possible. It does not assume that there are universal social domains, preferring instead to discover domains empirically as aspects of each society’s own classificatory schemes―in other words, its culture. And it rejects the notion that any social institution can be understood in isolation from its own context.",
		"The developmental control that children with certain serious medical problems can exert over their physical activity is relevant to device safety. For example, an infant in a crib and a cognitively intact 14­-year­-old confined to bed due to illness or injury may both be relatively inactive. The adolescent can, however, be expected to have more awareness of and control over movements such as rolling over that might dislodge or otherwise impair the functioning of a medical device such as a breathing tube or feeding tube. Likewise, a 5­-year­-old and a 25­-year­-old who have had a cardiac pacemaker implanted may each know that they need to protect the device, but developmental differences in the understanding of risk and causation and in the control of impulses increase the probability of risky behavior by the child, for example, jumping off a porch.",
		"There’s more to striving to be in the majority of one’s group than merely acquiring power. We work to be in the majority of our groups not just because the majority controls material and psychological resources, but also because who we are is largely defined by those who claim us as their own. Drawing distinctions between who’s in and who’s out, between who’s right and who’s wrong, between privileged or disadvantaged—in short, between us and them—motivates us to be counted among those who do the counting. We seek to belong to the majority of our group, even if our group is in the minority, not just because the majority holds the power, but because the privilege attached to being in the majority position is commonly viewed by others and by ourselves as deserved. We had it coming. This perception contributes to our sense of worth, of who we are, and to others’ assessments of our value as well.",
		"Eating was the original science, the original study of the environment. Kids, just like primitive life­forms, learn about reality by putting it in their mouths. This mouth knowledge knows no abstracts. The world is either sweet or bitter, smooth or prickly, pleasant or unpleasant. Mouth knowledge comes with gut­-level certainty. So to eat is literally to know. But to know what? It is to know self from non-self. Mouth knowledge taught us the boundaries of our bodies. When, as babies, we sucked an object, such as a pacifier, we felt it only from one side, from the side of the mouth. When we sucked our thumbs, we felt them from the outside, through the mouth, and from the inside, through the feeling of the thumb being sucked on. This mouth knowledge― unlike later school knowledge―gave us a glimpse of our paradoxical nature: that somehow we are both the subject and the object of our own experience.",
		"Multiple and often conflicting notions of truth coexist in Internet situations, ranging from outright lying through mutually aware pre-tence to playful trickery. As Patricia Wallace puts it, ‘The fact that it is so easy to lie and get away with it―as long as we can live with our own deceptions and the harm they may cause others―is a significant feature of the Internet.’ It is of course possible to live out a lie or fantasy logically and consistently, and it is on this principle that the games in virtual worlds operate and the nicknamed people in chat-groups interact. But it is by no means easy to maintain a consistent presence through language in a world where multiple interactions are taking place under pressure, where participants are often changing their names and identities, and where the cooperative principle can be arbitrarily abandoned. Putting this another way, when you see an Internet utterance, you often do not know how to take it, because you do not know what set of conversational principles it is obeying.",
		"A distinct emotional trait of human nature is to watch fellow humans closely, to learn their stories, and thereby to judge their character and dependability. And so it has ever been since the Pleistocene. The first bands classifiable to the genus Homo and their descendants were hunter­gatherers. Like the Kalahari Ju/’hoansi of today, they almost certainly depended on sophisticated cooperative behavior just to survive from one day to the next. That, in turn, required exact knowledge of the personal history and accomplishments of each of their groupmates, and equally they needed an empathetic sense of the feelings and propensities of others. It gives deep satisfaction—call it, if you will, a human instinct—not just to learn but also to share emotions stirred by the stories told by our companions. The whole of these performances pays off in survival and reproduction. Gossip and storytelling are Darwinian phenomena.",
		"Scaling up from the small to the large is often accompanied by an evolution from simplicity to complexity while maintaining basic elements unchanged or conserved. This is familiar in engineering, economics, companies, cities, organisms, and, perhaps most dramatically, evolutionary process. For example, a skyscraper in a large city is a significantly more complex object than a modest family dwelling in a small town, but the underlying principles of construction and design, including questions of mechanics, energy and information distribution, the size of electrical outlets, water faucets, telephones, laptops, doors, etc., all remain approximately the same independent of the size of the building. Similarly, organisms have evolved to have an enormous range of sizes and an extraordinary diversity of morphologies and interactions, which often reflect increasing complexity, yet fundamental building blocks like cells, mitochondria, capillaries, and even leaves do not appreciably change with body size or increasing complexity of the class of systems in which they are embedded.",
		"Knowing who an author is and what his or her likely intentions are in creating text or artwork is tremendously important to most of us. Not knowing who wrote, or created, some artwork is often very frustrating. Our culture places great worth on the identity of speakers, writers, and artists. Perhaps the single most important aspect of “authorship” is the vaguely apprehended presence of human creativity, personality, and authority that nominal authorship seems to provide. It is almost unthinkable for a visitor to an art museum to admire a roomful of paintings without knowing the names of the individual painters, or for a reader not to know who the writer is of the novel she is reading. Publishers proudly display authors’ names on the jackets, spines and title pages of their books. Book advertisements in The New York Review of Books and The New York Times Book Review regularly include pictures of authors and quote authors as they talk about their work, both of which show that our interest is as much in authors as in their books.",
		"All athletes have an innate preference for task­ or ego­-involved goals in sport. These predispositions, referred to as task and ego goal orientations, are believed to develop throughout childhood largely due to the types of people the athletes come in contact with and the situations they are placed in. If children consistently receive parental praise depending on their effort and recognition for personal improvement from their coaches, and are encouraged to learn from their mistakes, then they are likely to foster a task orientation. It becomes natural for them to believe that success is associated with mastery, effort, understanding, and personal responsibility. The behavior of their role models in sport also affects this development. Such an environment is far different from one where children are shaped by rewards for winning (alone), praise for the best grades, criticism or non­-selection despite making their best effort, or coaches whose style is to hand out unequal recognition. This kind of environment helps an ego orientation to flourish, along with the belief that ability and talent, not effort and personal endeavor, earn success.",
		"Research with human runners challenged conventional wisdom and found that the ground-reaction forces at the foot and the shock transmitted up the leg and through the body after impact with the ground varied little as runners moved from extremely compliant to extremely hard running surfaces. As a result, researchers gradually began to believe that runners are subconsciously able to adjust leg stiffness prior to foot strike based on their perceptions of the hardness or stiffness of the surface on which they are running. This view suggests that runners create soft legs that soak up impact forces when they are running on very hard surfaces and stiff legs when they are moving along on yielding terrain. As a result, impact forces passing through the legs are strikingly similar over a wide range of running surface types. Contrary to popular belief, running on concrete is not more damaging to the legs than running on soft sand.",
		"One of the great risks of writing is that even the simplest of choices regarding wording or punctuation can sometimes prejudice your audience against you in ways that may seem unfair. For example, look again at the old grammar rule forbidding the splitting of infinitives. After decades of telling students to never split an infinitive (something just done in this sentence), most composition experts now acknowledge that a split infinitive is not a grammar crime. Suppose you have written a position paper trying to convince your city council of the need to hire security personnel for the library, and half of the council members―the people you wish to convince―remember their eighth-grade grammar teacher’s warning about splitting infinitives. How will they respond when you tell them, in your introduction, that librarians are compelled “to always accompany” visitors to the rare book room because of the threat of damage? How much of their attention have you suddenly lost because of their automatic recollection of what is now a non-rule? It is possible, in other words, to write correctly and still offend your readers’ notions of your language competence.",
		"Even when we do something as apparently simple as picking up a screwdriver, our brain automatically adjusts what it considers body to include the tool. We can literally feel things with the end of the screwdriver. When we extend a hand, holding the screwdriver, we automatically take the length of the latter into account. We can probe difficult-to-reach places with its extended end, and comprehend what we are exploring. Furthermore, we instantly regard the screwdriver we are holding as “our” screwdriver, and get possessive about it. We do the same with the much more complex tools we use, in much more complex situations. The cars we pilot instantaneously and automatically become ourselves. Because of this, when someone bangs his fist on our car’s hood after we have irritated him at a crosswalk, we take it personally. This is not always reasonable. Nonetheless, without the extension of self into machine, it would be impossible to drive.",
		"A large part of what we see is what we expect to see. This explains why we “see” faces and figures in a flickering campfire, or in moving clouds. This is why Leonardo da Vinci advised artists to discover their motifs by staring at patches on a blank wall. A fire provides a constant flickering change in visual information that never integrates into anything solid and thereby allows the brain to engage in a play of hypotheses. On the other hand, the wall does not present us with very much in the way of visual clues, and so the brain begins to make more and more hypotheses and desperately searches for confirmation. A crack in the wall looks a little like the profile of a nose and suddenly a whole face appears, or a leaping horse, or a dancing figure. In cases like these the brain’s visual strategies are projecting images from within the mind out onto the world.",
		"Both the acquisition and subsequent rejection of agriculture are becoming increasingly recognized as adaptive strategies to local conditions that may have occurred repeatedly over the past ten millennia. For example, in a recent study of the Mlabri, a modern hunter­gatherer group from northern Thailand, it was found that these people had previously been farmers, but had abandoned agriculture about 500 years ago. This raises the interesting question as to how many of the diminishing band of contemporary hunter­gatherer cultures are in fact the descendents of farmers who have only secondarily readopted hunter­gathering as a more useful lifestyle, perhaps after suffering from crop failures, dietary deficiencies, or climatic changes. Therefore, the process of what may be termed the ‘agriculturalization’ of human societies was not necessarily irreversible, at least on a local level. Hunter­gatherer cultures across the world, from midwestern Amerindians to !Kung in the African Kalahari, have adopted and subsequently discarded agriculture, possibly on several occasions over their history, in response to factors such as game abundance, climatic change, and so on.",
		"Sometimes it seems that contemporary art isn’t doing its job unless it provokes the question, ‘But is it art?’ I’m not sure the question is worth asking. It seems to me that the line between art and not­art is never going to be a sharp one. Worse, as the various art forms―poetry, drama, sculpture, painting, fiction, dance, etc.―are so different, I’m not sure why we should expect to be able to come up with a single definition that can capture their variety. Art seems to be a paradigmatic example of a Wittgensteinian ‘family resemblance’ concept. Try to specify the necessary and sufficient condition for something qualifying as art and you’ll always find an exception to your criteria. If philosophy were to admit defeat in its search for some immutable essence of art, it is hardly through lack of trying. Arguably, we have very good reasons for thinking that this has been one of the biggest wild goose chases in the history of ideas.",
		"Rights imply obligations, but obligations need not imply rights. The obligations of parents to our children go way beyond their legal rights. Nor do the duties of rescue need to be matched by rights: we respond to a child drowning in a pond because of her plight, not her rights. A society that succeeds in generating many obligations can be more generous and harmonious than one relying only on rights. Obligations are to rights what taxation is to public spending ―the bit that is demanding. Western electorates have mostly learned that discussion of public spending must balance its benefits against how it would be financed. Otherwise, politicians promise higher spending during an election, and the post­-election excess of spending over revenue is resolved by inflation. Just as new obligations are similar to extra revenue, so the creation of rights is similar to extra spending. The rights may well be appropriate, but this can only be determined by a public discussion of the corresponding obligations.",
		"In the longer term, by bringing together enough data and enough computing power, the data­giants could hack the deepest secrets of life, and then use this knowledge not just to make choices for us or manipulate us, but also to re­engineer organic life and to create inorganic life forms. Selling advertisements may be necessary to sustain the giants in the short term, but they often evaluate apps, products and companies according to the data they harvest rather than according to the money they generate. A popular app may lack a business model and may even lose money in the short term, but as long as it sucks data, it could be worth billions. Even if you don’t know how to cash in on the data today, it is worth having it because it might hold the key to controlling and shaping life in the future. I don’t know for certain that the data­giants explicitly think about it in such terms, but their actions indicate that they value the accumulation of data more than mere dollars and cents.",
		"“What’s in a name? That which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet.” This thought of Shakespeare’s points up a difference between roses and, say, paintings. Natural objects, such as roses, are not interpreted. They are not taken as vehicles of meanings and messages. They belong to no tradition, strictly speaking have no style, and are not understood within a framework of culture and convention. Rather, they are sensed and savored relatively directly, without intellectual mediation, and so what they are called, either individually or collectively, has little bearing on our experience of them. What a work of art is titled, on the other hand, has a significant effect on the aesthetic face it presents and on the qualities we correctly perceive in it. A painting of a rose, by a name other than the one it has, might very well smell different, aesthetically speaking. The painting titled Rose of Summer and an indiscernible painting titled Vermillion Womanhood are physically, but also semantically and aesthetically, distinct objects of art.",
		"Genetic engineering followed by cloning to distribute many identical animals or plants is sometimes seen as a threat to the diversity of nature. However, humans have been replacing diverse natural habitats with artificial monoculture for millennia. Most natural habitats in the advanced nations have already been replaced with some form of artificial environment based on mass production or repetition. The real threat to biodiversity is surely the need to convert ever more of our planet into production zones to feed the ever-increasing human population. The cloning and transgenic alteration of domestic animals makes little difference to the overall situation. Conversely, the renewed interest in genetics has led to a growing awareness that there are many wild plants and animals with interesting or useful genetic properties that could be used for a variety of as-yet-unknown purposes. This has led in turn to a realization that we should avoid destroying natural ecosystems because they may harbor tomorrow’s drugs against cancer, malaria, or obesity.",
		"Since human beings are at once both similar and different, they should be treated equally because of both. Such a view, which grounds equality not in human uniformity but in the interplay of uniformity and difference, builds difference into the very concept of equality, breaks the traditional equation of equality with similarity, and is immune to monist distortion. Once the basis of equality changes so does its content. Equality involves equal freedom or opportunity to be different, and treating human beings equally requires us to take into account both their similarities and differences. When the latter are not relevant, equality entails uniform or identical treatment; when they are, it requires differential treatment. Equal rights do not mean identical rights, for individuals with different cultural backgrounds and needs might require different rights to enjoy equality in respect of whatever happens to be the content of their rights. Equality involves not just rejection of irrelevant differences as is commonly argued, but also full recognition of legitimate and relevant ones.",
		"Protopia is a state of becoming, rather than a destination. It is a process. In the protopian mode, things are better today than they were yesterday, although only a little better. It is incremental improvement or mild progress. The “pro” in protopian stems from the notions of process and progress. This subtle progress is not dramatic, not exciting. It is easy to miss because a protopia generates almost as many new problems as new benefits. The problems of today were caused by yesterday’s technological successes, and the technological solutions to today’s problems will cause the problems of tomorrow. This circular expansion of both problems and solutions hides a steady accumulation of small net benefits over time. Ever since the Enlightenment and the invention of science, we’ve managed to create a tiny bit more than we’ve destroyed each year. But that few percent positive difference is compounded over decades into what we might call civilization. Its benefits never star in movies.",
		"Some people may find it hard to believe they are making a difference all the time. In which case, it may help to abandon the global perspective for a moment and zoom in to our daily human interactions－in which we spend every moment either deciding what must happen next or going along with somebody else’s ideas. Either way, our actions are all purposeful, and all produce effects. Our day­-to­-day lives are hardly the stuff of history, you might argue. Certainly not compared with Julius Caesar invading Britain, Genghis Khan sacking Baghdad and Christopher Columbus discovering America. That’s how many people understand history. ‘The history of the world is but the biography of great men,’ wrote Thomas Carlyle. But the ‘great man’ theory of history has been on its way out for years. Nowadays, we recognize that those men couldn’t have done what they did on their own. And we identify historical significance in hitherto overlooked episodes.",
		"The diffusion of media products enables us in a certain sense to experience events, observe others and, in general, learn about a world that extends beyond the sphere of our day­-to­-day encounters. The spatial horizons of our understanding are thereby greatly expanded, for they are no longer restricted by the need to be physically present at the places where the observed events, etc., occur. So profound is the extent to which our sense of the world is shaped by media products today that, when we travel to distant parts of the world as a visitor or tourist, our lived experience is often preceded by a set of images and expectations acquired through extended exposure to media products. Even in those cases where our experience of distant places does not concur with our expectations, the feeling of novelty or surprise often attests to the fact that our lived experience is preceded by a set of preconceptions derived, at least to some extent, from the words and images conveyed by the media.",
		"At the level of hours and minutes, the most relevant constants are human heart rates, which normally vary from 60 to 100 beats per minute, and the need to spend roughly one­-third of our time sleeping in order to function properly. Biologists and physiologists still don’t know why this is so. Moving down to the level of time that occurs at 1/1000 of a second are biological constants with respect to the temporal resolution of our senses. If a sound has a gap in it shorter than 10 milliseconds, we will tend not to hear it, because of resolution limits of the auditory system. For a similar reason, a series of clicks ceases to sound like clicks and becomes a musical note when the clicks are presented at a rate of about once every 25 milliseconds. If you’re flipping through static (still) pictures, they must be presented slower than about once every 40 milliseconds in order for you to see them as separate images. Any faster than that and they exceed the temporal resolution of our visual system and we perceive motion where there is none.",
		"It is well established that the aerobic range of flight speeds for any bird is restricted. The well­-established U­-shaped function of aerodynamic power requirement as a function of flight speed has wide applicability. It shows that for most birds, slow flight, even for short periods, is not possible and this becomes more acute for birds with high wing loading and consequently higher average flight speeds. In essence, birds cannot readily slow down. Sustained slow flight for a bird which has a high average flight speed is costly or aerodynamically impossible and, hence, being able to reduce speed in order to match the rate of gain of information to increasing perceptual challenges is unlikely to occur. In other words, when the environment restricts the information available (e.g. rain, mist, low light levels), birds cannot easily fly more slowly in order to compensate for lowered visibility. Thus if birds are to fly under non­-ideal perceptual conditions, or visibility conditions change during a flight, they cannot act in the way that a careful car driver can and reduce their speed in order to gain information at a rate sufficient to match the new perceptual challenge.",
		"People unknowingly sabotage their own work when they withhold help or information from others or try to undermine them lest they become more successful or get more credit than “me.” Cooperation is alien to the ego, except when there is a secondary motive. The ego doesn’t know that the more you include others, the more smoothly things flow and the more easily things come to you. When you give little or no help to others or put obstacles in their path, the universe ― in the form of people and circumstances ― gives little or no help to you because you have cut yourself off from the whole. The ego’s unconscious core feeling of “not enough” causes it to react to someone else’s success as if that success had taken something away from “me.” It doesn’t know that your resentment of another person’s success curtails your own chances of success. In order to attract success, you need to welcome it wherever you see it.",
		"Jeffrey A. Rodgers, a vice president of a big company, was once taught the simple idea of pausing to refresh. It began when Jeff realized that as he drove home from work each evening his mind was still focused on work­-related projects. We all know this feeling. We may have left the office physically, but we are very much still there mentally, as our minds get caught in the endless loop of replaying the events of today and worrying about all the things we need to get done the following day. So now, as he gets to the door of his house, he applies what he calls “the pause that refreshes.” He stops for just a moment. He closes his eyes. He breathes in and out once: deeply and slowly. As he exhales, he lets the work issues fall away. This allows him to walk through the front door to his family with more singleness of purpose. It supports the sentiment attributed to Lao Tzu: “In work, do what you enjoy. In family life, be completely present.”",
		"Plants are genius chemists. They rely on their ability to manufacture chemical compounds for every single aspect of their survival. A plant with juicy leaves can’t run away to avoid being eaten. It relies on its own chemical defenses to kill microbes, deter pests, or poison would­-be predators. Plants also need to reproduce. They can’t impress a potential mate with a fancy dance, a victory in horn­-to­-horn combat, or a well­-constructed nest like animals do. Since plants need to attract pollinators to accomplish reproduction, they’ve evolved intoxicating scents, sweet nectar, and pheromones that send signals that bees and butterflies can’t resist. When you consider that plants solve almost all of their problems by making chemicals, and that there are nearly 400,000 species of plants on Earth, it’s no wonder that the plant kingdom is a source for a dazzling array of useful substances.",
		"The meritocratic emphasis on effort and hard work seeks to vindicate the idea that, under the right conditions, we are responsible for our success and thus capable of freedom. It also seeks to vindicate the faith that, if the competition is truly fair, success will align with virtue; those who work hard and play by the rules will earn the rewards they deserve. We want to believe that success, in sports and in life, is something we earn, not something we inherit. Natural gifts and the advantages they bring embarrass the meritocratic faith. They cast doubt on the conviction that praise and rewards flow from effort alone. In the face of this embarrassment, we inflate the moral significance of effort and striving. This can be seen, for example, in television coverage of the Olympics, which focuses less on the feats the athletes perform than on heartbreaking stories of the hardships and obstacles they have overcome, and the struggles they have gone through to triumph over injury, or a difficult childhood, or political turmoil in their native land.",
		"Contrary to popular opinion, woodpeckers don’t restrict themselves to rotten trees, and they often start construction in healthy trees. Just like us, woodpeckers want the place where they bring up their families to be solid and durable. Even though the birds are well equipped to hammer away at healthy wood, it would be too much for them to complete the job all at once. And that’s why they take a months-long break after making a hole that may be only an inch or two deep, hoping fungi will pitch in. As far as the fungi are concerned, this is the invitation they have been waiting for, because usually they can’t get past the bark. In this case, the fungi quickly move into the opening and begin to break down the wood. What the tree sees as a coordinated attack, the woodpecker sees as a(n) division of labor. After a while, the wood fibers are so soft that it’s much easier for the woodpecker to enlarge the hole.",
		"The urban environment is generally designed so as not to make contact with our skin. We do not push through bushes on our way to school or work. Roads and sidewalks are kept clear of obstacles. Only once in a while are we reminded of the materiality of the environment, as when we feel the brush of an unexpected tree branch or nearly fall over a curb. Most of our time is not even spent outside. “Outside” is often just a space we go through to get “inside.” Our time is largely spent indoors, where architecture and design collude to provide an environment as lacking as possible in tactile stimulation. In the modern university or office building, floors and walls are flat and smooth, corridors are clear, the air is still, the temperature is neutral, and elevators carry one effortlessly from one level to another. It is commonly assumed that we are best served by our tactile environment when we scarcely notice its presence.",
		"The ideal sound quality varies a lot in step with technological and cultural changes. Consider, for instance, the development of new digital audio formats such as MP3 and AAC. Various media feed us daily with data-compressed audio, and some people rarely experience CD-quality (that is, technical quality) audio. This tendency could lead to a new generation of listeners with other sound quality preferences. Research by Stanford University professor Jonathan Berger adds fuel to this thesis. Berger tested first-year university students’ preferences for MP3s annually for ten years. He reports that each year more and more students come to prefer MP3s to CD-quality audio. These findings indicate that listeners gradually become accustomed to data-compressed formats and change their listening preferences accordingly. The point is that while technical improvements strive toward increased sound quality in a technical sense (e.g., higher resolution and greater bit rate), listeners’ expectations do not necessarily follow the same path. As a result, “improved” technical digital sound quality may in some cases lead to a(n) decrease in the perceptual worth of the sound.",
		"Science shows that the size of a memory and our perception of time are coupled like gear teeth in a bicycle chain. Rich and novel experiences, like the recollections of the summers of our youth, have lots of new information associated with them. During those hot days, we learned how to swim or traveled to new places or mastered riding a bike without training wheels. The days went by slowly with those adventures. Yet, our adult lives have less novelty and newness, and are full of repeated tasks such as commuting or sending email or doing paperwork. The associated information filed for those chores is smaller, and there is less new footage for the recall part of the brain to draw upon. Our brain interprets these days filled with boring events as shorter, so summers swiftly speed by. Despite our desire for better clocks, our measuring stick of time isn’t fixed. We don’t measure time with seconds, like our clocks, but by our experiences. For us, time can slow down or time can fly.",
		"The growth of academic disciplines and sub-disciplines, such as art history or palaeontology, and of particular figures such as the art critic, helped produce principles and practices for selecting and organizing what was worthy of keeping, though it remained a struggle. Moreover, as museums and universities drew further apart toward the end of the nineteenth century, and as the idea of objects as a highly valued route to knowing the world went into decline, collecting began to lose its status as a worthy intellectual pursuit, especially in the sciences. The really interesting and important aspects of science were increasingly those invisible to the naked eye, and the classification of things collected no longer promised to produce cutting-edge knowledge. The term “butterfly collecting” could come to be used with the adjective “mere” to indicate a pursuit of secondary academic status.",
		"Some of the most insightful work on information seeking emphasizes “strategic self-ignorance,” understood as “the use of ignorance as an excuse to engage excessively in pleasurable activities that may be harmful to one’s future self.” The idea here is that if people are present-biased, they might avoid information that would make current activities less attractive ― perhaps because it would produce guilt or shame, perhaps because it would suggest an aggregate trade-off that would counsel against engaging in such activities. St. Augustine famously said, “God give me chastity―tomorrow.” Present-biased agents think: “Please let me know the risks―tomorrow.” Whenever people are thinking about engaging in an activity with short-term benefits but long-term costs, they might prefer to delay receipt of important information. The same point might hold about information that could make people sad or mad: “Please tell me what I need to know―tomorrow.”",
		"Concepts of nature are always cultural statements. This may not strike Europeans as much of an insight, for Europe’s landscape is so much of a blend. But in the new worlds― ‘new’ at least to Europeans―the distinction appeared much clearer not only to European settlers and visitors but also to their descendants. For that reason, they had the fond conceit of primeval nature uncontrolled by human associations which could later find expression in an admiration for wilderness. Ecological relationships certainly have their own logic and in this sense ‘nature’ can be seen to have a self-regulating but not necessarily stable dynamic independent of human intervention. But the context for ecological interactions has increasingly been set by humanity. We may not determine how or what a lion eats but we certainly can regulate where the lion feeds.",
		"Emma Brindley has investigated the responses of European robins to the songs of neighbors and strangers. Despite the large and complex song repertoire of European robins, they were able to discriminate between the songs of neighbors and strangers. When they heard a tape recording of a stranger, they began to sing sooner, sang more songs, and overlapped their songs with the playback more often than they did on hearing a neighbor’s song. As Brindley suggests, the overlapping of song may be an aggressive response. However, this difference in responding to neighbor versus stranger occurred only when the neighbor’s song was played by a loudspeaker placed at the boundary between that neighbor’s territory and the territory of the bird being tested. If the same neighbor’s song was played at another boundary, one separating the territory of the test subject from another neighbor, it was treated as the call of a stranger. Not only does this result demonstrate that the robins associate locality with familiar songs, but it also shows that the choice of songs used in playback experiments is highly important.",
		"Relatively undeveloped languages have no single word for plants. The lack of a term doesn’t mean they don’t perceive differences, and it doesn’t mean they don’t know the difference between spinach and a cactus; they just lack an all­en-compassing term with which to refer to plants. We see cases like this in our own language. For example, English lacks a single basic term to refer to edible mushrooms. We also lack a term for all the people you would have to notify if you were going into the hospital for three weeks. These might include close relatives, friends, your employer, the newspaper delivery person, and anyone you had appointments with during that period. The lack of a term doesn’t mean you don’t understand the concept; it simply means that the category isn’t reflected in our language. This could be because a need for it hasn’t been so pressing that a word needed to be coined.",
		"Psychologists and neuroscientists warn that when we rely on technology to perform tasks such as navigation for us, our awareness of our physical environment fades as we become immersed instead in an abstract, computerized world. Studies show that we tend to place too much faith in the accuracy of information from computer monitors, and to ignore or discount information from our own eyes and ears, an effect that has caused pilots to crash planes and GPS­-following tourists to drive into the sea. A team led by the British neuroscientist Hugo Spiers found in 2017 that areas of the brain normally involved in navigation just don’t engage when people use GPS. “When we have technology telling us which way to go,” said Spiers, “these parts of the brain simply don’t respond to the street network. In that sense our brain has switched off its interest in the streets around us.”",
		"The conventional view of what the state should do to foster innovation is simple: it just needs to get out of the way. At best, governments merely facilitate the economic dynamism of the private sector; at worst, their lumbering, heavy­-handed, and bureaucratic institutions actively inhibit it. The fast­-moving, risk­-loving, and pioneering private sector, by contrast, is what really drives the type of innovation that creates economic growth. According to this view, the secret behind Silicon Valley lies in its entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. The state can intervene in the economy―but only to fix market failures or level the playing field. It can regulate the private sector in order to account for the external costs companies may impose on the public, such as pollution, and it can invest in public goods, such as basic scientific research or the development of drugs with little market potential. It should not, however, directly attempt to create and shape markets.",
		"The designer in the Age of Algorithms poses a threat to American jurisprudence because the algorithm is only as good as the designer’s understanding of the intended use of the algorithm. The person designing the algorithm may be an excellent software engineer, but without the knowledge of all the factors that need to go into an algorithmic process, the engineer could unknowingly produce an algorithm whose decisions are at best incomplete and at worst discriminatory and unfair. Compounding the problem, an algorithm design firm might be under contract to design algorithms for a wide range of uses, from determining which patients awaiting transplants are chosen to receive organs, to which criminals facing sentencing should be given probation or the maximum sentence. That firm is not going to be staffed with subject matter experts who know what questions each algorithm needs to address, what databases the algorithm should use to collect its data, and what pitfalls the algorithm needs to avoid in churning out decisions.",
		"When examining the archaeological record of human culture, one has to consider that it is vastly incomplete. Many aspects of human culture have what archaeologists describe as low archaeological visibility, meaning they are difficult to identify archaeologically. Archaeologists tend to focus on tangible (or material) aspects of culture: things that can be handled and photographed, such as tools, food, and structures. Reconstructing intangible aspects of culture is more difficult, requiring that one draw more inferences from the tangible. It is relatively easy, for example, for archaeologists to identify and draw inferences about technology and diet from stone tools and food remains. Using the same kinds of physical remains to draw inferences about social systems and what people were thinking about is more difficult. Archaeologists do it, but there are necessarily more inferences involved in getting from physical remains recognized as trash to making interpretations about belief systems.",
		"Even as mundane a behavior as watching TV may be a way for some people to escape painful self-awareness through distraction. To test this idea, Sophia Moskalenko and Steven Heine gave participants false feedback about their test performance, and then seated each one in front of a TV set to watch a video as the next part of the study. When the video came on, showing nature scenes with a musical soundtrack, the experimenter exclaimed that this was the wrong video and went supposedly to get the correct one, leaving the participant alone as the video played. The participants who had received failure feedback watched the video much longer than those who thought they had succeeded. The researchers concluded that distraction through television viewing can effectively relieve the discomfort associated with painful failures or mismatches between the self and self-guides. In contrast, successful participants had little wish to be distracted from their self-related thoughts!",
		"It is important to recognise the interdependence between individual, culturally formed actions and the state of cultural integration. People work within the forms provided by the cultural patterns that they have internalised, however contradictory these may be. Ideas are worked out as logical implications or consequences of other accepted ideas, and it is in this way that cultural innovations and discoveries are possible. New ideas are discovered through logical reasoning, but such discoveries are inherent in and integral to the conceptual system and are made possible only because of the acceptance of its premises. For example, the discoveries of new prime numbers are ‘real’ consequences of the particular number system employed. Thus, cultural ideas show ‘advances’ and ‘developments’ because they are outgrowths of previous ideas. The cumulative work of many individuals produces a corpus of knowledge within which certain ‘discoveries’ become possible or more likely. Such discoveries are ‘ripe’ and could not have occurred earlier and are also likely to be made simultaneously by numbers of individuals.",
		"Enabling animals to operate in the presence of harmless stimuli is an almost universal function of learning. Most animals innately avoid objects they have not previously encountered. Unfamiliar objects may be dangerous; treating them with caution has survival value. If persisted in, however, such careful behavior could interfere with feeding and other necessary activities to the extent that the benefit of caution would be lost. A turtle that withdraws into its shell at every puff of wind or whenever a cloud casts a shadow would never win races, not even with a lazy rabbit. To overcome this problem, almost all animals habituate to safe stimuli that occur frequently. Confronted by a strange object, an inexperienced animal may freeze or attempt to hide, but if nothing unpleasant happens, sooner or later it will continue its activity. The possibility also exists that an unfamiliar object may be useful, so if it poses no immediate threat, a closer inspection may be worthwhile.",
		"Writing lyrics means shaping the meaning of something which, if left as instrumental music, would remain undefined; there is a change of the level of expression. That’s one reason why for many songwriters ‘lyric’ seems to be the hardest word. Picture this scene: a songwriter at the piano, or with a guitar, plays with chords and creates an emotion and atmosphere that is creatively inspiring. Our songwriter invents a melody to go with this mood. Then comes the moment where words are required, and that means getting specific. This sad­ or happy­-sounding chord progression must now direct its general sadness or happiness to a particular human situation. A lyric is the place where the emotional suggestions of pure music are defined as concrete human concerns and events. It’s like a piece of translation, from one medium into another. The general musical mood is focused by a lyric into a context, a voice, a human drama.",
		"In the health area, the concern with use after “purchase” is as critical as and even more critical than the concern with the purchase itself. The person who is sold on and goes through disease screening procedures but does not follow through with medical treatment for a diagnosed condition, is as much of a failure as a person who did not avail himself of the screening program to begin with. The obese individual who has been successfully sold on going on a medically prescribed diet but is lured back to his candy jar and apple pie after one week, is as much of a failure as if he never had been sold on the need to lose and control his weight. The most challenging, most difficult, most perplexing problem is not how to sell people on health­-supportive practices, not even how to get them to initiate such practices. We have been fairly successful with these. It is to persuade and help them to stick with new practices.",
		"Like faces, sometimes movement can fool us into thinking that something has a mind. For example, toys that seem to come alive fascinate children. In my day, one of the popular toys was a piece of finely coiled wire called a “Slinky.” It could appear to walk by stretching and lifting up one end over another down an incline, a bit like an acrobatic caterpillar. The attraction of the Slinky on Christmas Day was the lifelike movement it had as it stepped down the stairs before someone trod on it or twisted the spring and ruined it for good. Toys that appear to be alive are curiosities because they challenge how we think inanimate objects and living things should behave. Many toys today exploit this principle to great effect, but be warned: not all babies enjoy objects that suddenly seem lifelike. This anxiety probably reflects their confusion over the question, “Is it alive or what?” Once babies decide that something is alive, they are inclined to see its movements as purposeful.",
		"If the nature of a thing is such that when removed from the environment in which it naturally occurs it alters radically, you will not glean an accurate account of it by examining it within laboratory conditions. If you are only accustomed to seeing it operate within such an artificial arena, you may not even recognize it when it is functioning in its normal context. Indeed, if you ever spot it in that environment you may think it is something else. Similarly, if you believe that leadership only takes the form of heroic men metaphorically charging in on white horses to save the day, you may neglect the many acts which contribute to their ability to be there. You may fail to see the importance of the grooms who care for the horses, the messengers who bring attention to the crisis or the role played by those cheering from the sidelines. You may miss the fact that without troops supporting them, any claims to leading on the part of these heroes would be rather hollow.",
		"In the Indian language of pali, mettā means benevolence, kindness or tenderness. It is one of the most important ideas in Buddhism. Buddhism recommends a daily ritual meditation (known as mettā bhāvanā) to foster this attitude. The meditation begins with a call to think carefully every morning of an individual with whom one tends to get irritated or to whom one feels aggressive or cold and—in place of one’s normal hostile impulses—to rehearse kindly messages like ‘I hope you will find peace’ or ‘I wish you to be free from suffering’. This practice can be extended outwards ultimately to include pretty much everyone on Earth. The background assumption is that, with the right stimulus, our feelings towards people are not fixed and unalterable, but open to deliberate change and improvement. Compassion is a learnable skill, and we need to direct it as much towards those we are tempted to dismiss and detest as to those we love.",
		"When trying to understand the role of the sun in ancient journeys, the sources become fewer and the journeys less well known. Herodotus writes about an exploratory voyage commissioned by the ancient Egyptian King Necho II in about 600 BC. Necho II reportedly ordered a Phoenician expedition to sail clockwise around Africa, starting at the Red Sea and returning to the mouth of the Nile. They were gone for three years. Herodotus writes that the Phoenicians, upon returning from their heroic expedition, reported that after sailing south and then turning west, they found the sun was on their right, the opposite direction to where they were used to seeing it or expecting it to be. Contemporary astronomical science was simply not strong enough to fabricate such an accurate, fundamental and yet prosaic detail of where the sun would be after sailing past the equator and into the southern hemisphere. It is this that leads many of today’s historians to conclude that the journey must have taken place.",
		"Gordon Allport argued that history records many individuals who were not content with an existence that offered them little variety, a lack of psychic tension, and minimal challenge. Allport considers it normal to be pulled forward by a vision of the future that awakened within persons their drive to alter the course of their lives. He suggests that people possess a need to invent motives and purposes that would consume their inner energies. Similarly, Erich Fromm proposed a need on the part of humans to rise above the roles of passive creatures in an accidental if not random world. To him, humans are driven to transcend the state of merely having been created; instead, humans seek to become the creators, the active shapers of their own destiny. Rising above the passive and accidental nature of existence, humans generate their own purposes and thereby provide themselves with a true basis of freedom.",
		"The history of perspective in Western painting matters because of what it reveals for the art of living. Just as most artists conform to the stylistic conventions of the era into which they are born, we similarly conform to prevailing social conventions about how to live. These unwritten rules typically include getting married and having children, owning your own home and having a mortgage, having a regular job and commuting to work, and flying abroad for holidays. For some people these are realities, for others they remain aspirations. It is common to feel social pressure to comply with them. At this point in Western history, they are amongst the dominant conventions that most of us have accepted with little questioning, much as Vermeer and other Dutch baroque painters of the seventeenth century accepted linear perspective without question. It is difficult to see beyond the limitations of the culture that has shaped our ways of looking at the world and at ourselves. We are trapped in the perspective of our own time.",
		"Not only was Eurasia by chance blessed with biological abundance, but the very orientation of the continent greatly promoted the spread of crops between distant regions. When the supercontinent Pangea fragmented, it was torn apart along rifts that just so happened to leave Eurasia as a broad landmass running in an east-west direction—the entire continent stretches more than a third of the way around the world, but mostly within a relatively narrow range of latitudes. As it is the latitude on the Earth that largely determines the climate and length of the growing season, crops domesticated in one part of Eurasia can be transplanted across the continent with only minimal need for adaptation to the new locale. Thus wheat cultivation spread readily from the uplands of Turkey throughout Mesopotamia, to Europe, and all the way round to India, for example. The twin continents of the Americas, by contrast, lie in a north-south direction. Here, the spreading of crops originally domesticated in one region to another led to a much harder process of re-adapting the plant species to different growing conditions.",
		"When you are born, your neocortex knows almost nothing. It doesn’t know any words, what buildings are like, how to use a computer, or what a door is and how it moves on hinges. It has to learn countless things. The overall structure of the neocortex is not random. Its size, the number of regions it has, and how they are connected together is largely determined by our genes. For example, genes determine what parts of the neocortex are connected to the eyes, what other parts are connected to the ears, and how those parts connect to each other. Therefore, we can say that the neocortex is structured at birth to see, hear, and even learn language. But it is also true that the neocortex doesn’t know what it will see, what it will hear, and what specific languages it might learn. We can think of the neocortex as starting life having some built-in assumptions about the world but knowing nothing in particular. Through experience, it learns a rich and complicated model of the world.",
		"While early clocks marked only the hour or quarter-hour, by 1700 most clocks had acquired minute hands, and by 1800 second hands were standard. This unprecedented ability to measure time precisely found its most authoritarian expression in the factory clock, which became a prime weapon of the Industrial Revolution. As the historian of technology Lewis Mumford argued, “the clock, not the steam engine, is the key-machine of the modern industrial age.” Soon factory workers were clocking in, filling out timesheets, and being punished for lateness. With time sliced into smaller and smaller periods, business owners could measure the speed of their workers down to the second, and gradually increase the pace of the production line. Workers who tried to reject this strict control by “going slow” were swiftly fired. The cruel power of the clock fed the growing culture of utilitarian efficiency, so brilliantly depicted by Charles Dickens in his 1854 novel Hard Times, where the office of Mr. Gradgrind contained “a deadly statistical clock in it, which measured every second with a beat like a rap upon a coffin-lid.”",
		"Imagine some mutation appears which makes animals spontaneously die at the age of 50. This is unambiguously disadvantageous—but only very slightly so. More than 99 per cent of animals carrying this mutation will never experience its ill effects because they will die before it has a chance to act. This means that it’s pretty likely to remain in the population—not because it’s good, but because the ‘force of natural selection’ at such advanced ages is not strong enough to get rid of it. Conversely, if a mutation killed the animals at two years, striking them down when many could reasonably expect to still be alive and producing children, evolution would get rid of it very promptly: animals with the mutation would soon be outcompeted by those fortunate enough not to have it, because the force of natural selection is powerful in the years up to and including reproductive age. Thus, problematic mutations can accumulate, just so long as they only affect animals after they’re old enough to have reproduced.",
		"Young contemporary artists who employ digital technologies in their practice rarely make reference to computers. For example, Wade Guyton, an abstractionist who uses a word processing program and inkjet printers, does not call himself a computer artist. Moreover, some critics, who admire his work, are little concerned about his extensive use of computers in the art-making process. This is a marked contrast from three decades ago when artists who utilized computers were labeled by critics―often disapprovingly―as computer artists. For the present generation of artists, the computer, or more appropriately, the laptop, is one in a collection of integrated, portable digital technologies that link their social and working life. With tablets and cell phones surpassing personal computers in Internet usage, and as slim digital devices resemble nothing like the room-sized mainframes and bulky desktop computers of previous decades, it now appears that the computer artist is finally extinct.",
		"The critic who wants to write about literature from a formalist perspective must first be a close and careful reader who examines all the elements of a text individually and questions how they come together to create a work of art. Such a reader, who respects the autonomy of a work, achieves an understanding of it by looking inside it, not outside it or beyond it. Instead of examining historical periods, author biographies, or literary styles, for example, he or she will approach a text with the assumption that it is a self-contained entity and that he or she is looking for the governing principles that allow the text to reveal itself. For example, the correspondences between the characters in James Joyce’s short story “Araby” and the people he knew personally may be interesting, but for the formalist they are less relevant to understanding how the story creates meaning than are other kinds of information that the story contains within itself.",
		"Manufacturers design their innovation processes around the way they think the process works. The vast majority of manufacturers still think that product development and service development are always done by manufacturers, and that their job is always to find a need and fill it rather than to sometimes find and commercialize an innovation that lead users have already developed. Accordingly, manufacturers have set up market-research departments to explore the needs of users in the target market, product-development groups to think up suitable products to address those needs, and so forth. The needs and prototype solutions of lead users―if encountered at all―are typically rejected as outliers of no interest. Indeed, when lead users’ innovations do enter a firm’s product line―and they have been shown to be the actual source of many major innovations for many firms―they typically arrive with a lag and by an unusual and unsystematic route.",
		"Development can get very complicated and fanciful. A fugue by Johann Sebastian Bach illustrates how far this process could go, when a single melodic line, sometimes just a handful of notes, was all that the composer needed to create a brilliant work containing lots of intricate development within a coherent structure. Ludwig van Beethoven’s famous Fifth Symphony provides an exceptional example of how much mileage a classical composer can get out of a few notes and a simple rhythmic tapping. The opening da-da-da-DUM that everyone has heard somewhere or another appears in an incredible variety of ways throughout not only the opening movement, but the remaining three movements, like a kind of motto or a connective thread. Just as we don’t always see the intricate brushwork that goes into the creation of a painting, we may not always notice how Beethoven keeps finding fresh uses for his motto or how he develops his material into a large, cohesive statement. But a lot of the enjoyment we get from that mighty symphony stems from the inventiveness behind it, the impressive development of musical ideas.",
		"There is a difference between a newsworthy event and news. A newsworthy event will not necessarily become news, just as news is often about an event that is not, in itself, newsworthy. We can define news as an event that is recorded in the news media, regardless of whether it is about a newsworthy event. The very fact of its transmission means that it is regarded as news, even if we struggle to understand why that particular story has been selected from all the other events happening at the same time that have been ignored. News selection is subjective so not all events seen as newsworthy by some people will make it to the news. All journalists are familiar with the scenario where they are approached by someone with the words ‘I’ve got a great story for you’. For them, it is a major news event, but for the journalist it might be something to ignore.",
		"Infants’ preference for looking at new things is so strong that psychologists began to realize that they could use it as a test of infants’ visual discrimination, and even their memory. Could an infant tell the difference between two similar images? Between two similar shades of the same color? Could an infant recall having seen something an hour, a day, a week ago? The inbuilt attraction to novel images held the answer. If the infant’s gaze lingered, it suggested that the infant could tell that a similar image was nonetheless different in some way. If the infant, after a week without seeing an image, didn’t look at it much when it was shown again, the infant must be able at some level to remember having seen it the week before. In most cases, the results revealed that infants were more cognitively capable earlier than had been previously assumed. The visual novelty drive became, indeed, one of the most powerful tools in psychologists’ toolkit, unlocking a host of deeper insights into the capacities of the infant mind.",
		"Imagine there are two habitats, a rich one containing a lot of resources and a poor one containing few, and that there is no territoriality or fighting, so each individual is free to exploit the habitat in which it can achieve the higher pay­off, measured as rate of consumption of resource. With no competitors, an individual would simply go to the better of the two habitats and this is what we assume the first arrivals will do. But what about the later arrivals? As more competitors occupy the rich habitat, the resource will be depleted, and so less profitable for further newcomers. Eventually a point will be reached where the next arrivals will do better by occupying the poorer quality habitat where, although the resource is in shorter supply, there will be less competition. Thereafter, the two habitats should be filled so that the profitability for an individual is the same in each one. In other words, competitors should adjust their distribution in relation to habitat quality so that each individual enjoys the same rate of acquisition of resources.",
		"Neither Einstein’s relativity nor Bach’s fugues are such stuff as survival is made on. Yet each is a perfect example of human capacities that were essential to our having prevailed. The link between scientific aptitude and solving real­-world challenges may be more apparent, but minds that reason with analogy and metaphor, minds that represent with color and texture, minds that imagine with melody and rhythm are minds that cultivate a more flourishing cognitive landscape. Which is all just to say that the arts may well have been vital for developing the flexibility of thought and fluency of intuition that our relatives needed to fashion the spear, to invent cooking, to harness the wheel, and, later, to write the Mass in B Minor and, later still, to crack our rigid perspective on space and time. Across hundreds of thousands of years, artistic endeavors may have been the playground of human cognition, providing a safe arena for training our imaginative capacities and infusing them with a potent faculty for innovation.",
		"More than just having territories, animals also partition them. And this insight turned out to be particularly useful for zoo husbandry. An animal’s territory has an internal arrangement that Heini Hediger compared to the inside of a person’s house. Most of us assign separate functions to separate rooms, but even if you look at a one-room house you will find the same internal specialization. In a cabin or a mud hut, or even a Mesolithic cave from 30,000 years ago, this part is for cooking, that part is for sleeping; this part is for making tools and weaving, that part is for waste. We keep a neat functional organization. To a varying extent, other animals do the same. A part of an animal’s territory is for eating, a part for sleeping, a part for swimming or wallowing, a part may be set aside for waste, depending on the species of animal.",
		"Fans feel for feeling’s own sake. They make meanings beyond what seems to be on offer. They build identities and experiences, and make artistic creations of their own to share with others. A person can be an individual fan, feeling an “idealized connection with a star, strong feelings of memory and nostalgia,” and engaging in activities like “collecting to develop a sense of self.” But, more often, individual experiences are embedded in social contexts where other people with shared attachments socialize around the object of their affections. Much of the pleasure of fandom comes from being connected to other fans. In their diaries, Bostonians of the 1800s described being part of the crowds at concerts as part of the pleasure of attendance. A compelling argument can be made that what fans love is less the object of their fandom than the attachments to (and differentiations from) one another that those affections afford.",
		"There was nothing modern about the idea of men making women’s clothes―we saw them doing it for centuries in the past. In the old days, however, the client was always primary and her tailor was an obscure craftsman, perhaps talented but perhaps not. She had her own ideas like any patron, there were no fashion plates, and the tailor was simply at her service, perhaps with helpful suggestions about what others were wearing. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, with the hugely successful rise of the artistic male couturier, it was the designer who became celebrated, and the client elevated by his inspired attention. In a climate of admiration for male artists and their female creations, the dress-designer first flourished as the same sort of creator. Instead of the old rule that dressmaking is a craft, a modern connection between dress-design and art was invented that had not been there before.",
		"In trying to explain how different disciplines attempt to understand autobiographical memory the literary critic Daniel Albright said, “Psychology is a garden, literature is a wilderness.” He meant, I believe, that psychology seeks to make patterns, find regularity, and ultimately impose order on human experience and behavior. Writers, by contrast, dive into the unruly, untamed depths of human experiences. What he said about understanding memory can be extended to our questions about young children’s minds. If we psychologists are too bent on identifying the orderly pattern, the regularities of children’s minds, we may miss an essential and pervasive characteristic of our topic: the child’s more unruly and imaginative ways of talking and thinking. It is not only the developed writer or literary scholar who seems drawn toward a somewhat wild and idiosyncratic way of thinking; young children are as well. The psychologist interested in young children may have to venture a little more often into the wilderness in order to get a good picture of how children think.",
		"Much of what we call political risk is in fact uncertainty. This applies to all types of political risks, from civil strife to expropriations to regulatory changes. Political risk, unlike credit or market or operational risk, can be unsystematic and therefore more difficult to address in classic statistical terms. What is the probability that terrorists will attack the United States again? Unlike earthquakes or hurricanes, political actors constantly adapt to overcome the barriers created by risk managers. When corporations structure foreign investments to mitigate risks of expropriations, through international guarantees or legal contracts, host governments seek out new forms of obstruction, such as creeping expropriation or regulatory discrimination, that are very hard and legally costly to prove. Observation of a risk changes the risk itself. There are ways to mitigate high‑impact, low‑probability events. But analysis of these risks can be as much art as science.",
		"Ecological health depends on keeping the surface of the earth rich in humus and minerals so that it can provide a foundation for healthy plant and animal life. The situation is disrupted if the soil loses these raw materials or if great quantities of contaminants are introduced into it. When man goes beneath the surface of the earth and drags out minerals or other compounds that did not evolve as part of this system, then problems follow. The mining of lead and cadmium are examples of this. Petroleum is also a substance that has been dug out of the bowels of the earth and introduced into the surface ecology by man. Though it is formed from plant matter, the highly reduced carbon compounds that result are often toxic to living protoplasm. In some cases this is true of even very tiny amounts, as in the case of “polychlorinated biphenyls,” a petroleum product which can cause cancer.",
		"Magical thinking, intellectual insecurity, and confirmation bias are all powerful barriers to scientific discovery; they blocked the eyes of generations of astronomers before Copernicus. But as twenty‑first‑century researchers have discovered, these three barriers can all be destroyed with a simple teaching trick: transporting our brain to an environment outside our own. That environment can be a nature preserve many miles from our home, or a computer‑simulated Mars, or any other space that our ego doesn’t associate directly with our health, social status, and material success. In that environment, our ego will be less inclined to take the failure of its predictions personally. Certainly, our ego may feel a little upset that its guesses about the nature preserve or Mars were wrong, but it was never really that invested in the guesses to begin with. Why should it care too much about things that have no bearing on its own fame or well‑being? So, in that happy state of apathy, our ego is less likely to get data manipulative, mentally threatened, or magically minded, leaving the rest of our brain free to abandon failed hypotheses and venture new ones.",
		"If you are unconvinced that our beliefs influence how we interpret facts, consider the example of the “flying horse.” Depictions of galloping horses from prehistoric times up until the mid‑1800s typically showed horses’ legs splayed while galloping, that is, the front legs reaching far ahead as the hind legs stretched far behind. People just “knew” that’s how horses galloped, and that is how they “saw” them galloping. Cavemen saw them this way, Aristotle saw them this way, and so did Victorian gentry. But all of that ended when, in 1878, Eadweard Muybridge published a set of twelve pictures he had taken of a galloping horse in the space of less than half a second using twelve cameras hooked to wire triggers. Muybridge’s photos showed clearly that a horse goes completely airborne in the third step of the gallop with its legs collected beneath it, not splayed. It is called the moment of suspension. Now even kids draw horses galloping this way.",
		"The quest for knowledge in the material world is a never­-ending pursuit, but the quest does not mean that a thoroughly schooled person is an educated person or that an educated person is a wise person. We are too often blinded by our ignorance of our ignorance, and our pursuit of knowledge is no guarantee of wisdom. Hence, we are prone to becoming the blind leading the blind because our overemphasis on competition in nearly everything makes looking good more important than being good. The resultant fear of being thought a fool and criticized therefore is one of greatest enemies of true learning. Although our ignorance is undeniably vast, it is from the vastness of this selfsame ignorance that our sense of wonder grows. But, when we do not know we are ignorant, we do not know enough to even question, let alone investigate, our ignorance. No one can teach another person anything. All one can do with and for someone else is to facilitate learning by helping the person to discover the wonder of their ignorance.",
		"Lewis­Williams believes that the religious view of hunter groups was a contract between the hunter and the hunted. ‘The powers of the underworld allowed people to kill animals, provided people responded in certain ritual ways, such as taking fragments of animals into the caves and inserting them into the “membrane”.’ This is borne out in the San. Like other shamanistic societies, they have admiring practices between human hunters and their prey, suffused with taboos derived from extensive natural knowledge. These practices suggest that honouring may be one method of softening the disquiet of killing. It should be said that this disquiet needn’t arise because there is something fundamentally wrong with a human killing another animal, but simply because we are aware of doing the killing. And perhaps, too, because in some sense we ‘know’ what we are killing. We make sound guesses that the pain and desire for life we feel—our worlds of experience—have a counterpart in the animal we kill. As predators, this can create problems for us. One way to smooth those edges, then, is to view that prey with respect.",
		"The empiricist philosopher John Locke argued that when the human being was first born, the mind was simply a blank slate—a tabula rasa—waiting to be written on by experience. Locke believed that our experience shapes who we are and who we become—and therefore he also believed that, given different experiences, human beings would have different characters. The influence of these ideas was profound, particularly for the new colonies in America, for example, because these were conscious attempts to make a new start and to form a new society. The new society was to operate on a different basis from that of European culture, which was based on the feudal system in which people’s place in society was almost entirely determined by birth, and which therefore tended to emphasize innate characteristics. Locke’s emphasis on the importance of experience in forming the human being provided an optimistic framework for those trying to form a different society.",
		"In A Theory of Adaptation, Linda Hutcheon argues that “An adaptation is not vampiric: it does not draw the life­blood from its source and leave it dying or dead, nor is it paler than the adapted work. It may, on the contrary, keep that prior work alive, giving it an afterlife it would never have had otherwise.” Hutcheon’s refusal to see adaptation as “vampiric” is particularly inspiring for those of us who do work on adaptations. The idea of an “afterlife” of texts, of seeing what comes before as an inspiration for what comes now, is, by its very definition, keeping works “alive.” Adaptations for young adults, in particular, have the added benefit of engaging the young adult reader with both then and now, past and present—functioning as both “monuments” to history and the “flesh” of the reader’s lived experience. While this is true for adaptations in general, it is especially important for those written with young adults in mind. Such adaptations allow young readers to make personal connections with texts that might otherwise come across as old­-fashioned or irrelevant.",
		"Although a balance or harmony between partners clearly develops over time in a relationship, it is also a factor in initial attraction and interest in a partner. That is, to the extent that two people share similar verbal and nonverbal habits in a first meeting, they will be more comfortable with one another. For example, fast-paced individuals talk and move quickly and are more expressive, whereas slow-paced individuals have a different tempo and are less expressive. Initial interactions between people at opposite ends of such a continuum may be more difficult than those between similar types. In the case of contrasting styles, individuals may be less interested in pursuing a relationship than if they were similar in interaction styles. Individuals with similar styles, however, are more comfortable and find that they just seem to “click” with one another. Thus, behavioral coordination may provide a selection filter for the initiation of a relationship.",
		"Animals arguably make art. The male bowerbirds of New Guinea and Australia dedicate huge fractions of their time and energy to creating elaborate structures from twigs, flowers, berries, beetle wings, and even colorful trash. These are the backdrops to their complex mating dances, which include acrobatic moves and even imitations of other species. What’s most amazing about the towers and “bowers” they construct is that they aren’t stereotyped like a beehive or hummingbird nest. Each one is different. Artistic skill, along with fine craftsbirdship, is rewarded by the females. Many researchers suggest these displays are used by the females to gauge the cognitive abilities of her potential mates, but Darwin thought that she was actually attracted to their beauty. In other words, the bowers aren’t simply signals of mate quality; they are appreciated by the females for their own sake, much as we appreciate a painting or a bouquet of spring flowers. A 2013 study looked at whether bowerbirds that did better on cognitive tests were more successful at attracting mates. They were not, suggesting whatever the females are looking for, it isn’t a straightforward indicator of cognitive ability.",
		"Running a business that sells goods and services to consumers requires getting to know the products they like. More than that, however, you want to link positive experiences to the products they purchase. In traditional or online sales, people are bound to favorably regard the vendor and product that they could easily inquire about and quickly acquire in good order. Using the product can increase or decrease their satisfaction, and they will remember to repurchase products that meet and exceed their expectations. Traditional stores make the shopping experience pleasant by their displays and personal service. Internet retailers lead buyers to products they want through speedy searches and clicks. A new online selling method that can generate millions of dollars in purchases within a few minutes is livestream selling. That’s when hosts streaming their shows live demonstrate a product and even interactively receive comments and answer questions from their viewers through the power of social media. If they like the product, they buy it immediately through an e-commerce feature on the platform. Buyers say that the experience is so convenient, it is like talking to a friend.",
		"In Hegel’s philosophy, even though there is interaction and interrelation between the universal and the individual, the universal still has more priority than the individual. For Hegel, individuals are not distinguished in terms of Reason. In Philosophy of Right Hegel stresses particularity and universality as follows: “A man, who acts perversely, exhibits particularity. The rational is the highway on which everyone travels, and no one is specially marked.” Here, Hegel maintains that individuals can be differentiated from each other in terms of their acts but they are not differentiated with respect to reason. There are specific thoughts, but they are finally resolved into the universal. One might say that Hegel seems to focus on the individual like Aristotle but in reality, he subtly treats the universal as fundamental whereas Aristotle considers the individual as primary substance and universal as secondary substance; in so doing Aristotle emphasizes the universal to be subordinate to the individual in contrast to Hegel.",
		"People have always needed to eat, and they always will. Rising emphasis on self-expression values does not put an end to material desires. But prevailing economic orientations are gradually being reshaped. People who work in the knowledge sector continue to seek high salaries, but they place equal or greater emphasis on doing stimulating work and being able to follow their own time schedules. Consumption is becoming progressively less determined by the need for sustenance and the practical use of the goods consumed. People still eat, but a growing component of food’s value is determined by its nonmaterial aspects. People pay a premium to eat exotic cuisines that provide an interesting experience or that symbolize a distinctive life-style. The publics of postindustrial societies place growing emphasis on “political consumerism,” such as boycotting goods whose production violates ecological or ethical standards. Consumption is less and less a matter of sustenance and more and more a question of life-style―and choice.",
		"In labor-sharing groups, people contribute labor to other people on a regular basis (for seasonal agricultural work such as harvesting) or on an irregular basis (in the event of a crisis such as the need to rebuild a barn damaged by fire). Labor sharing groups are part of what has been called a “moral economy” since no one keeps formal records on how much any family puts in or takes out. Instead, accounting is socially regulated. The group has a sense of moral community based on years of trust and sharing. In a certain community of North America, labor sharing is a major economic factor of social cohesion. When a family needs a new barn or faces repair work that requires group labor, a barn-raising party is called. Many families show up to help. Adult men provide manual labor, and adult women provide food for the event. Later, when another family needs help, they call on the same people.",
		"Whatever their differences, scientists and artists begin with the same question: can you and I see the same thing the same way? If so, how? The scientific thinker looks for features of the thing that can be stripped of subjectivity―ideally, those aspects that can be quantified and whose values will thus never change from one observer to the next. In this way, he arrives at a reality independent of all observers. The artist, on the other hand, relies on the strength of her artistry to effect a marriage between her own subjectivity and that of her readers. To a scientific thinker, this must sound like magical thinking: you’re saying you will imagine something so hard it’ll pop into someone else’s head exactly the way you envision it? The artist has sought the opposite of the scientist’s observer-independent reality. She creates a reality dependent upon observers, indeed a reality in which objectivity should be maintained in order for it to exist at all.",
		"One of the common themes of the Western philosophical tradition is the distinction between sensual perceptions and rational knowledge. Since Plato, the supremacy of rational reason is based on the assertion that it is able to extract true knowledge from experience. As the discussion in the Republic helps to explain, perceptions are inherently unreliable and misleading because the senses are subject to errors and illusions. Only the rational discourse has the tools to overcome illusions and to point towards true knowledge. For instance, perception suggests that a figure in the distance is smaller than it really is. Yet, the application of logical reasoning will reveal that the figure only appears small because it obeys the laws of geometrical perspective. Nevertheless, even after the perspectival correction is applied and reason concludes that perception is misleading, the figure still appears small, and the truth of the matter is revealed not in the perception of the figure but in its rational representation.",
		"Learning is constructive, not destructive. This means we don’t replace mental models―we simply expand upon them. To understand what I mean, think back to your childhood. There was likely a time when you believed in Santa Claus; your mental model accepted him and your predictions accounted for his existence. At some point, however, you came to recognize he was fictitious and you updated your mental model accordingly. At that moment, you didn’t suddenly forget everything about Santa Claus. To this day, you can still recognize him, speak of him and embrace young children’s belief in him. In other words, you didn’t destroy your old mental model, you simply added new information to it. By building upon old mental models we are able to maintain ties to the past, foster a deeper understanding of concepts and develop an ever­-expanding pool of information to draw upon in order to continually adapt to an ever­-evolving world.",
		"A commonality between conceptual and computer art was the suppression of authorial presence. Conceptual artists decoupled the relationship between the art object and artist by mitigating all personal signs of invention. The artist became detached from the idea of personalized draftsmanship by installing a predetermined system―a type of instruction for another to follow. That way there was, as Sol LeWitt states, no “dependence on the skill of the artist as a craftsman.” Effectively any person could carry out the instructions. The same process was at work in computer art, where artists devised a predetermined drawing algorithm for the computer automaton to carry out the instruction. The human agent initiated the conceptual form, and a machine actuated it. Likewise, the computer artwork lacked any autographic mark, trace of spontaneity, or artistic authenticity. The plotter arm would replace the human arm in the production process.",
		"Innate behaviors used for finding food, such as grazing, scavenging, or hunting, are more dependent on learning than behaviors used to consume food. Mating, nesting, eating, and prey­killing behaviors tend to be governed more by instinct. The greater dependence on learning to find food makes animals in the wild more flexible and able to adapt to a variety of environments. Behaviors used to kill or consume food can be the same in any environment. Ernst Mayr, an evolutionary biologist, called these different behavioral systems “open” or “closed” to the effects of experience. A lion hunting her prey is an example of an open system. The hunting female lion recognizes her prey from a distance and approaches it carefully. Charles Herrick, a neurobiologist, wrote, “the details of the hunt vary every time she hunts. Therefore no combination of simple reflex arcs laid down in the nervous system will be adequate to meet the infinite variations of the requirements for obtaining food.”",
		"The revolution’s victorious party can claim to have resolved the fundamental anomalies of the old paradigm and to have renewed the prospects for successful research governed by shared assumptions. Indeed, the new community typically rewrites the textbooks, and retells its own history, to reflect this point of view. But from the standpoint of the losers, or even of those who look on impartially, such rewritings might seem to mark change without any genuine claim to progress, because there is no neutral standard by which to assess the merits of the change. The resulting body of knowledge is in any case not cumulative, since much of what was previously known (or merely believed) had to be excluded without ever having been conclusively refuted. One likewise cannot plausibly talk about revolutionary reconstitutions of science as aiming toward truth, for similarly, there can be no impartial formulation of standards for its assessment. The available justification of scientific knowledge after revolutions, couched in new terms according to newly instituted standards, may well be sufficient, but perhaps only because these standards and terms are now inevitably our own.",
		"In the post-World War II years after 1945, unparalleled economic growth fueled a building boom and a massive migration from the central cities to the new suburban areas. The suburbs were far more dependent on the automobile, signaling the shift from primary dependence on public transportation to private cars. Soon this led to the construction of better highways and freeways and the decline and even loss of public transportation. With all of these changes came a privatization of leisure. As more people owned their own homes, with more space inside and lovely yards outside, their recreation and leisure time was increasingly centered around the home or, at most, the neighborhood. One major activity of this home-based leisure was watching television. No longer did one have to ride the trolly to the theater to watch a movie; similar entertainment was available for free and more conveniently from television.",
		"Many people create and share pictures and videos on the Internet. The difficulty is finding what you want. Typically, people want to search using words (rather than, say, example sketches). Because most pictures don’t come with words attached, it is natural to try and build tagging systems that tag images with relevant words. The underlying machinery is straightforward―we apply image classification and object detection methods and tag the image with the output words. But tags aren’t a comprehensive description of what is happening in an image. It matters who is doing what, and tags don’t capture this. For example, tagging a picture of a cat in the street with the object categories “cat”, “street”, “trash can” and “fish bones” leaves out the information that the cat is pulling the fish bones out of an open trash can on the street.",
		"An invention or discovery that is too far ahead of its time is worthless; no one can follow. Ideally, an innovation opens up only the next step from what is known and invites the culture to move forward one hop. An overly futuristic, unconventional, or visionary invention can fail initially (it may lack essential not-yet-invented materials or a critical market or proper understanding) yet succeed later, when the ecology of supporting ideas catches up. Gregor Mendel’s 1865 theories of genetic heredity were correct but ignored for 35 years. His sharp insights were not accepted because they did not explain the problems biologists had at the time, nor did his explanation operate by known mechanisms, so his discoveries were out of reach even for the early adopters. Decades later science faced the urgent questions that Mendel’s discoveries could answer. Now his insights were only one step away. Within a few years of one another, three different scientists each independently rediscovered Mendel’s forgotten work, which of course had been there all along.",
		"Prior to photography, places did not travel well. While painters have always lifted particular places out of their ‘dwelling’ and transported them elsewhere, paintings were time-consuming to produce, relatively difficult to transport and one-of-a-kind. The multiplication of photographs especially took place with the introduction of the half-tone plate in the 1880s that made possible the mechanical reproduction of photographs in newspapers, periodicals, books and advertisements. Photography became coupled to consumer capitalism and the globe was now offered ‘in limitless quantities, figures, landscapes, events which had not previously been utilised either at all, or only as pictures for one customer’. With capitalism’s arrangement of the world as a ‘department store’, ‘the proliferation and circulation of representations ...... achieved a spectacular and virtually inescapable global magnitude’. Gradually photographs became cheap mass- produced objects that made the world visible, aesthetic and desirable. Experiences were ‘democratised’ by translating them into cheap images. Light, small and mass-produced photographs became dynamic vehicles for the spatiotemporal circulation of places.",
		"There’s reason to worry that an eyes-on­-the­-prize mentality could be a mistake. Lots of research shows that we tend to be over­confident about how easy it is to be self­-disciplined. This is why so many of us optimistically buy expensive gym memberships when paying per­-visit fees would be cheaper, register for online classes we’ll never complete, and purchase family­-size chips on discount to trim our monthly snack budget, only to consume every last crumb in a single sitting. We think “future me” will be able to make good choices, but too often “present me” gives in to temptation. People have a remarkable ability to ignore their own failures. Even when we flounder again and again, many of us manage to maintain a rosy optimism about our ability to do better next time rather than learning from our past mistakes. We cling to fresh starts and other reasons to stay upbeat, which may help us get out of bed in the morning but can prevent us from approaching change in the smartest possible way.",
		"The way we perceive the colors of the rainbow, and the universe in general, is influenced by the words we use to describe them. This is not limited to visual perception but also applies to smell, taste, touch, our perception of time and countless other human experiences. A wine or Scotch connoisseur, for example, has a much richer vocabulary at their disposal to describe the fullness, finish, flavors and aroma of the drink, which in turn improves their ability to recognize and remember subtle differences of which a non­-expert may be unaware. Similarly, a chef or perfumer has at their disposal labels for flavors and smells that allow them to perceive, differentiate among, prepare and remember subtle variations. The labels that we have at our disposal influence how we see the world around us. Regardless of where you place the limits of linguistic effects on cognition, there is evidence that at least some of the things that we perceive and remember differ depending on what labels we use.",
		"A connection with ancestors, especially remote ones, is useful for getting a wide­-angled, philosophical view of life. Whereas our immediate ancestors are notably skilled at helping us with the “little pictures,” namely the particular, the trees—say, a problem with a boss—our remote ones are best for seeing the “Big Picture,” namely the general, the forest—say, the meaning of our job. As modern people rush around blowing small problems out of proportion, thus contributing to a global anxiety epidemic, ancestral spirits have a broader perspective that can calm the disquieted soul. When it comes to a trivial problem, for example, they’ll just tell us, “This too will pass.” They appreciate how rapidly and often things change. According to American anthropologist Richard Katz, for instance, Fijians say that from the ancestral viewpoint whatever looks unfortunate may turn out to be fortunate after all: “What may seem to be a horrible outcome ...... is seen in another light by the ancestors.” The ancestors, it might be said, keep their heads when everyone around them is losing theirs.",
		"One of the criticisms of Stoicism by modern translators and teachers is the amount of repetition. Marcus Aurelius, for example, has been dismissed by academics as not being original because his writing resembles that of other, earlier Stoics. This criticism misses the point. Even before Marcus’s time, Seneca was well aware that there was a lot of borrowing and overlap among the philosophers. That’s because real philosophers weren’t concerned with authorship, but only what worked. More important, they believed that what was said mattered less than what was done. And this is true now as it was then. You’re welcome to take all of the words of the great philosophers and use them to your own liking (they’re dead; they don’t mind). Feel free to make adjustments and improvements as you like. Adapt them to the real conditions of the real world. The way to prove that you truly understand what you speak and write, that you truly are original, is to put them into practice.",
		"From about ages eight through sixteen, our manual dexterity has strengthened through continually improving eye­-hand coordination. There is considerable improvement in handwriting skills. We gain mastery over the mechanics of language. We also gradually eliminate the logical gaps in our stories―characteristic of our earlier stage of perception―as intense preoccupation with the whole vision gives way to preoccupation with correctness. As a result, our writing and oral storying become increasingly conventional and literal, with an accompanying loss of the spontaneity and originality that characterized our earlier efforts. At this stage our vocabulary is firmly grounded. We use words everyone else uses. We have little need to invent metaphors to communicate. By now we know that a star is “a hot gaseous mass floating in space” in contrast to our innocent stage, when we noticed, “Look that star is like a flower without a stem!”",
		"The commonsense understanding of the moral status of altruistic acts conforms to how most of us think about our responsibilities toward others. We tend to get offended when someone else or society determines for us how much of what we have should be given away; we are adults and should have the right to make such decisions for ourselves. Yet, when interviewed, altruists known for making the largest sacrifices—and bringing about the greatest benefits to their recipients—assert just the opposite. They insist that they had absolutely no choice but to act as they did. Organ donors, and everyday citizens who risk their own lives to save others in mortal danger are remarkably consistent in their explicit denials that they have done anything deserving of high praise as well as in their assurance that anyone in their shoes should have done exactly the same thing. To be sure, it seems that the more altruistic someone is, the more they are likely to insist that they have done no more than all of us would be expected to do, lest we shirk our basic moral obligation to humanity.",
		"Epictetus wrote, “A man’s master is he who is able to confirm or remove whatever that man seeks or shuns.” If you depend on no one except yourself to satisfy your desires, you will have no master other than yourself and you will be free. Stoic philosophy was about that―taking charge of your life, learning to work on those things that are within your power to accomplish or change and not to waste energy on things you cannot. In particular, the Stoics warned against reacting emotionally to what is outside your control. Often, Epictetus argued, it’s not our circumstances that get us down but rather the judgments we make about them. Consider anger. We don’t get angry at the rain if it spoils our picnic. That would be silly because we can’t do anything about the rain. But we often do get angry if someone mistreats us. We usually can’t control or change that person any more than we can stop the rain, so that is equally silly. More generally, it is just as pointless to tie our feelings of well­being to altering another individual’s behavior as it is to tie them to the weather. Epictetus wrote, “If it concerns anything not in our control, be prepared to say that it is nothing to you.”",
		"Japanese used to have a color word, ao, that spanned both green and blue. In the modern language, however, ao has come to be restricted mostly to blue shades, and green is usually expressed by the word midori. When the first traffic lights were imported from the United States and installed in Japan in the 1930s, they were just as green as anywhere else. Nevertheless, in common parlance the go light was called ao shingoo, perhaps because the three primary colors on Japanese artists’ palettes are traditionally aka(red), kiiro(yellow), and ao. The label ao for a green light did not appear so out of the ordinary at first, because of the remaining associations of the word ao with greenness. But over time, the difference between the green color and the dominant meaning of the word ao began to feel awkward. Nations that are less assertive might have opted for the solution of simply changing the official name of the go light to midori. Not so the Japanese. Rather than alter the name to fit reality, the Japanese government announced in 1973 that reality should be altered to fit the name: henceforth, go lights would be a color that better corresponded to the dominant meaning of ao.",
		"The concept of humans doing multiple things at a time has been studied by psychologists since the 1920s, but the term “multitasking” didn’t exist until the 1960s. It was used to describe computers, not people. Back then, ten megahertz was so fast that a new word was needed to describe a computer’s ability to quickly perform many tasks. In retrospect, they probably made a poor choice, for the expression “multitasking” is inherently deceptive. Multitasking is about multiple tasks alternately sharing one resource (the CPU), but in time the context was flipped and it became interpreted to mean multiple tasks being done simultaneously by one resource (a person). It was a clever turn of phrase that’s misleading, for even computers can process only one piece of code at a time. When they “multitask,” they switch back and forth, alternating their attention until both tasks are done. The speed with which computers tackle multiple tasks feeds the illusion that everything happens at the same time, so comparing computers to humans can be confusing.",
		"My friend was disappointed that scientific progress has not cured the world’s ills by abolishing wars and starvation; that gross human inequality is still widespread; that happiness is not universal. My friend made a common mistake―a basic misunderstanding in the nature of knowledge. Knowledge is amoral―not immoral but morality neutral. It can be used for any purpose, but many people assume it will be used to further their favorite hopes for society―and this is the fundamental flaw. Knowledge of the world is one thing; its uses create a separate issue. To be disappointed that our progress in understanding has not remedied the social ills of the world is a legitimate view, but to confuse this with the progress of knowledge is absurd. To argue that knowledge is not progressing because of the African or Middle Eastern conflicts misses the point. There is nothing inherent in knowledge that dictates any specific social or moral application.",
		"According to a renowned French scholar, the growth in the size and complexity of human populations was the driving force in the evolution of science. Early, small communities had to concentrate all their physical and mental effort on survival; their thoughts were focused on food and religion. As communities became larger, some people had time to reflect and debate. They found that they could understand and predict events better if they reduced passion and prejudice, replacing these with observation and inference. But while a large population may have been necessary, in itself it was not sufficient for science to germinate. Some empires were big, but the rigid social control required to hold an empire together was not beneficial to science, just as it was not beneficial to reason. The early nurturing and later flowering of science required a large and loosely structured, competitive community to support original thought and freewheeling incentive. The rise in commerce and the decline of authoritarian religion allowed science to follow reason in seventeenth-century Europe.",
		"Increased size affects group life in a number of ways. There is evidence that larger groups (five or six members) are more productive than smaller groups (two or three members). Members of larger groups tend to offer more suggestions than members of smaller groups, and although they seem to reach less agreement, they also show less tension. These differences may reflect the greater need of larger groups to solve organizational problems. Members may realize that their behavior must become more goal-directed, since it is unlikely that they can coordinate their actions without making a special effort to do so. Larger groups also put more pressure on their members to conform. In such groups, it is harder for everyone to take part equally in discussions or to have the same amount of influence on decisions. There is evidence that groups with an even number of members differ from groups with an odd number of members. The former disagree more than the latter and suffer more deadlocks as a result. Groups with an even number of members may split into halves. This is impossible in groups with an odd number of members―one side always has a numerical advantage. According to some researchers, the number five has special significance. Groups of this size usually escape the problems we have just outlined. Moreover, they are not plagued by the fragility and tensions found in groups of two or three. Groups of five rate high in member satisfaction; because of the odd number of members, deadlocks are unlikely when disagreements occur.",
		"When two cultures come into contact, they do not exchange every cultural item. If that were the case, there would be no cultural differences in the world today. Instead, only a small number of cultural elements ever spread from one culture to another. Which cultural item is accepted depends largely on the item’s use and compatibility with already existing cultural traits. For example, it is not likely that men’s hair dyes designed to “get out the gray” will spread into parts of rural Africa where a person’s status is elevated with advancing years. Even when a(n) innovation is consistent with a society’s needs, there is still no guarantee that it will be accepted. For example, most people in the United States using US customary units (e.g., inch, foot, yard, mile, etc.) have resisted adopting the metric system even though making such a change would enable US citizens to interface with the rest of the world more efficiently.",
		"Some distinctions between good and bad are hardwired into our biology. Infants enter the world ready to respond to pain as bad and to sweet (up to a point) as good. In many situations, however, the boundary between good and bad is a reference point that changes over time and depends on the immediate circumstances. Imagine that you are out in the country on a cold night, inadequately dressed for the pouring rain, your clothes soaked. A stinging cold wind completes your misery. As you wander around, you find a large rock that provides some shelter from the fury of the elements. The biologist Michel Cabanac would call the experience of that moment intensely pleasurable because it functions, as pleasure normally does, to indicate the direction of a biologically significant improvement of circumstances. The pleasant relief will not last very long, of course, and you will soon be shivering behind the rock again, driven by your renewed suffering to seek better shelter.",
		"Research and development for seed improvement has long been a public domain and government activity for the common good. However, private capital started to flow into seed production and took it over as a sector of the economy, creating an artificial split between the two aspects of the seed’s nature: its role as means of production and its role as product. This process gained pace after the invention of hybrid breeding of maize in the late 1920s. Today most maize seed cultivated are hybrids. The companies that sell them are able to keep the distinct parent lines from farmers, and the grain that they produce is not suited for seed saving and replanting. The combination guarantees that farmers will have to buy more seed from the company each season. In the 1990s the extension of patent laws as the only intellectual property rights tool into the area of seed varieties started to create a growing market for private seed companies.",
		"Long before Walt Whitman wrote Leaves of Grass, poets had addressed themselves to fame. Horace, Petrarch, Shakespeare, Milton, and Keats all hoped that poetic greatness would grant them a kind of earthly immortality. Whitman held a similar faith that for centuries the world would value his poems. But to this ancient desire to live forever on the page, he added a new sense of fame. Readers would not simply attend to the poet’s work; they would be attracted to the greatness of his personality. They would see in his poems a vibrant cultural performance, an individual springing from the book with tremendous charisma and appeal. Out of the political rallies and electoral parades that marked Jacksonian America, Whitman defined poetic fame in relation to the crowd. Other poets might look for their inspiration from the goddess of poetry. Whitman’s poet sought the approval of his contemporaries. In the instability of American democracy, fame would be dependent on celebrity, on the degree to which the people rejoiced in the poet and his work.",
		"We might describe science that has no known practical value as basic science or basic research. Our exploration of worlds such as Jupiter would be called basic science, and it is easy to argue that basic science is not worth the effort and expense because it has no known practical use. Of course, the problem is that we have no way of knowing what knowledge will be of use until we acquire that knowledge. In the middle of the 19th century, Queen Victoria is supposed to have asked physicist Michael Faraday what good his experiments with electricity and magnetism were. He answered, “Madam, what good is a baby?” Of course, Faraday’s experiments were the beginning of the electronic age. Many of the practical uses of scientific knowledge that fill our world―transistors, vaccines, plastics―began as basic research. Basic scientific research provides the raw materials that technology and engineering use to solve problems. Basic scientific research has yet one more important use that is so valuable it seems an insult to refer to it as merely functional. Science is the study of nature, and as we learn more about how nature works, we learn more about what our existence in this universe means for us. The seemingly impractical knowledge we gain from space probes to other worlds tells us about our planet and our own role in the scheme of nature. Science tells us where we are and what we are, and that knowledge is beyond value.",
		"The creativity that children possess needs to be cultivated throughout their development. Research suggests that over-structuring the child’s environment may actually limit creative and academic development. This is a central problem with much of science instruction. The exercises or activities are devised to eliminate different options and to focus on predetermined results. The answers are structured to fit the course assessments, and the wonder of science is lost along with cognitive intrigue. We define cognitive intrigue as the wonder that stimulates and intrinsically motivates an individual to voluntarily engage in an activity. The loss of cognitive intrigue may be initiated by the sole use of play items with predetermined conclusions and reinforced by rote instruction in school. This is exemplified by toys, games, and lessons that are a(n) end in and of themselves and require little of the individual other than to master the planned objective.",
		"Temporal resolution is particularly interesting in the context of satellite remote sensing. The temporal density of remotely sensed imagery is large, impressive, and growing. Satellites are collecting a great deal of imagery as you read this sentence. However, most applications in geography and environmental studies do not require extremely fine-grained temporal resolution. Meteorologists may require visible, infrared, and radar information at sub-hourly temporal resolution; urban planners might require imagery at monthly or annual resolution; and transportation planners may not need any time series information at all for some applications. Again, the temporal resolution of imagery used should meet the requirements of your inquiry. Sometimes researchers have to search archives of aerial photographs to get information from that past that pre-date the collection of satellite imagery.",
		"Grief is unpleasant. Would one not then be better off without it altogether? Why accept it even when the loss is real? Perhaps we should say of it what Spinoza said of regret: that whoever feels it is “twice unhappy or twice helpless.” Laurence Thomas has suggested that the utility of “negative sentiments” (emotions like grief, guilt, resentment, and anger, which there is seemingly a reason to believe we might be better off without) lies in their providing a kind of guarantee of authenticity for such dispositional sentiments as love and respect. No occurrent feelings of love and respect need to be present throughout the period in which it is true that one loves or respects. One might therefore sometimes suspect, in the absence of the positive occurrent feelings, that one no longer loves. At such times, negative emotions like grief offer a kind of testimonial to the authenticity of love or respect.",
		"Over a period of time the buildings which housed social, legal, religious, and other rituals evolved into forms that we subsequently have come to recognize and associate with those buildings’ function. This is a two-way process; the building provides the physical environment and setting for a particular social ritual such as traveling by train or going to the theater, as well as the symbolic setting. The meaning of buildings evolves and becomes established by experience and we in turn read our experience into buildings. Buildings arouse an empathetic reaction in us through these projected experiences, and the strength of these reactions is determined by our culture, our beliefs, and our expectations. They tell stories, for their form and spatial organization give us hints about how they should be used. Their physical layout encourages some uses and inhibits others; we do not go backstage in a theater unless especially invited. Inside a law court the precise location of those involved in the legal process is an integral part of the design and an essential part of ensuring that the law is upheld.",
		"Apocalypse Now, a film produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, gained widespread popularity, and for good reason. The film is an adaptation of Joseph Conrad’s novel Heart of Darkness, which is set in the African Congo at the end of the 19th century. Unlike the original novel, Apocalypse Now is set in Vietnam and Cambodia during the Vietnam War. The setting, time period, dialogue and other incidental details are changed but the fundamental narrative and themes of Apocalypse Now are the same as those of Heart of Darkness. Both describe a physical journey, reflecting the central character’s mental and spiritual journey, down a river to confront the deranged Kurtz character, who represents the worst aspects of civilisation. By giving Apocalypse Now a setting that was contemporary at the time of its release, audiences were able to experience and identify with its themes more easily than they would have if the film had been a literal adaptation of the novel.",
		"How many of the lunches that you ate over the last week can you recall? Do you remember what you ate today? I hope so. Yesterday? I bet it takes a moment’s effort. And what about the day before yesterday? What about a week ago? It’s not so much that your memory of last week’s lunch has disappeared; if provided with the right cue, like where you ate it, or whom you ate it with, you would likely recall what had been on your plate. Rather, it’s difficult to remember last week’s lunch because your brain has filed it away with all the other lunches you’ve ever eaten as just another lunch. When we try to recall something from a category that includes as many instances as “lunch” or “wine,” many memories compete for our attention. The memory of last Wednesday’s lunch isn’t necessarily gone; it’s that you lack the right hook to pull it out of a sea of lunchtime memories. But a wine that talks: That’s unique. It’s a memory without rivals.",
		"In the less developed world, the percentage of the population involved in agriculture is declining, but at the same time, those remaining in agriculture are not benefiting from technological advances. The typical scenario in the less developed world is one in which a very few commercial agriculturalists are technologically advanced while the vast majority are incapable of competing. Indeed, this vast majority have lost control over their own production because of larger global causes. As an example, in Kenya, farmers are actively encouraged to grow export crops such as tea and coffee at the expense of basic food production. The result is that a staple crop, such as maize, is not being produced in a sufficient amount. The essential argument here is that the capitalist mode of production is affecting peasant production in the less developed world in such a way as to limit the production of staple foods, thus causing a food problem.",
		"Over the past 60 years, as mechanical processes have replicated behaviors and talents we thought were unique to humans, we’ve had to change our minds about what sets us apart. As we invent more species of AI, we will be forced to surrender more of what is supposedly unique about humans. Each step of surrender─ we are not the only mind that can play chess, fly a plane, make music, or invent a mathematical law ─will be painful and sad. We’ll spend the next three decades─indeed, perhaps the next century─ in a permanent identity crisis, continually asking ourselves what humans are good for. If we aren’t unique toolmakers, or artists, or moral ethicists, then what, if anything, makes us special? In the grandest irony of all, the greatest benefit of an everyday, utilitarian AI will not be increased productivity or an economics of abundance or a new way of doing science─although all those will happen. The greatest benefit of the arrival of artificial intelligence is that AIs will help define humanity.",
		"In one sense, every character you create will be yourself. You’ve never murdered, but your murderer’s rage will be drawn from memories of your own extreme anger. Your love scenes will contain hints of your own past kisses and sweet moments. That scene in which your octogenarian feels humiliated will draw on your experience of humiliation in the eighth grade, even though the circumstances are totally different and you’re not even consciously thinking about your middle-school years. Our characters’ emotions, after all, draw on our own emotions. Sometimes, however, you will want to use your life more directly in your fiction, dramatizing actual incidents. Charles Dickens used his desperate experience as a child laborer in Victorian England to write David Copperfield. Should you create a protagonist based directly on yourself? The problem with this─and it is a very large problem─is that almost no one can view himself objectively on the page. As the writer, you’re too close to your own complicated makeup. It can thus be easier and more effective to use a situation or incident from your life but make it happen to a character who is not you. In fact, that’s what authors largely have done. You can still, of course, incorporate aspects of yourself: your love of Beethoven, your quick temper, your soccer injuries. But by applying your own experience to a different protagonist, you can take advantage of your insider knowledge of the situation, and yet gain an objectivity and control that the original intense situation, by definition, did not have.",
		"Finkenauer and Rimé investigated the memory of the unexpected death of Belgium’s King Baudouin in 1993 in a large sample of Belgian citizens. The data revealed that the news of the king’s death had been widely socially shared. By talking about the event, people gradually constructed a social narrative and a collective memory of the emotional event. At the same time, they consolidated their own memory of the personal circumstances in which the event took place, an effect known as “flashbulb memory.” The more an event is socially shared, the more it will be fixed in people’s minds. Social sharing may in this way help to counteract some natural tendency people may have. Naturally, people should be driven to “forget” undesirable events. Thus, someone who just heard a piece of bad news often tends initially to deny what happened. The repetitive social sharing of the bad news contributes to realism.",
		"Minorities tend not to have much power or status and may even be dismissed as troublemakers, extremists or simply ‘weirdos’. How, then, do they ever have any influence over the majority? The social psychologist Serge Moscovici claims that the answer lies in their behavioural style, i.e. the way the minority gets its point across. The crucial factor in the success of the suffragette movement was that its supporters were consistent in their views, and this created a considerable degree of social influence. Minorities that are active and organised, who support and defend their position consistently, can create social conflict, doubt and uncertainty among members of the majority, and ultimately this may lead to social change. Such change has often occurred because a minority has converted others to its point of view. Without the influence of minorities, we would have no innovation, no social change. Many of what we now regard as ‘major’ social movements (e.g. Christianity, trade unionism or feminism) were originally due to the influence of an outspoken minority.",
		"Heritage is concerned with the ways in which very selective material artefacts, mythologies, memories and traditions become resources for the present. The contents, interpretations and representations of the resource are selected according to the demands of the present; an imagined past provides resources for a heritage that is to be passed onto an imagined future. It follows too that the meanings and functions of memory and tradition are defined in the present. Further, heritage is more concerned with meanings than material artefacts. It is the former that give value, either cultural or financial, to the latter and explain why they have been selected from the near infinity of the past. In turn, they may later be discarded as the demands of present societies change, or even, as is presently occurring in the former Eastern Europe, when pasts have to be reinvented to reflect new presents. Thus heritage is as much about forgetting as remembering the past.",
		"The human species is unique in its ability to expand its functionality by inventing new cultural tools. Writing, arithmetic, science―all are recent inventions. Our brains did not have enough time to evolve for them, but I reason that they were made possible because we can mobilize our old areas in novel ways. When we learn to read, we recycle a specific region of our visual system known as the visual word-form area, enabling us to recognize strings of letters and connect them to language areas. Likewise, when we learn Arabic numerals we build a circuit to quickly convert those shapes into quantities―a fast connection from bilateral visual areas to the parietal quantity area. Even an invention as elementary as finger-counting changes our cognitive abilities dramatically. Amazonian people who have not invented counting are unable to make exact calculations as simple as, say, 6—2. This “cultural recycling” implies that the functional architecture of the human brain results from a complex mixture of biological and cultural constraints.",
		"The role of science can sometimes be overstated, with its advocates slipping into scientism. Scientism is the view that the scientific description of reality is the only truth there is. With the advance of science, there has been a tendency to slip into scientism, and assume that any factual claim can be authenticated if and only if the term ‘scientific’ can correctly be ascribed to it. The consequence is that non-scientific approaches to reality―and that can include all the arts, religion, and personal, emotional and value-laden ways of encountering the world―may become labelled as merely subjective, and therefore of little account in terms of describing the way the world is. The philosophy of science seeks to avoid crude scientism and get a balanced view on what the scientific method can and cannot achieve.",
		"The Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget frequently analyzed children’s conception of time via their ability to compare or estimate the time taken by pairs of events. In a typical experiment, two toy cars were shown running synchronously on parallel tracks, one running faster and stopping further down the track. The children were then asked to judge whether the cars had run for the same time and to justify their judgment. Preschoolers and young school-age children confuse temporal and spatial dimensions: Starting times are judged by starting points, stopping times by stopping points and durations by distance, though each of these errors does not necessitate the others. Hence, a child may claim that the cars started and stopped running together (correct) and that the car which stopped further ahead, ran for more time (incorrect).",
		"The future of our high-tech goods may lie not in the limitations of our minds, but in our ability to secure the ingredients to produce them. In previous eras, such as the Iron Age and the Bronze Age, the discovery of new elements brought forth seemingly unending numbers of new inventions. Now the combinations may truly be unending. We are now witnessing a fundamental shift in our resource demands. At no point in human history have we used more elements, in more combinations, and in increasingly refined amounts. Our ingenuity will soon outpace our material supplies. This situation comes at a defining moment when the world is struggling to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Fortunately, rare metals are key ingredients in green technologies such as electric cars, wind turbines, and solar panels. They help to convert free natural resources like the sun and wind into the power that fuels our lives. But without increasing today’s limited supplies, we have no chance of developing the alternative green technologies we need to slow climate change.",
		"There have been many attempts to define what music is in terms of the specific attributes of musical sounds. The famous nineteenth-century critic Eduard Hanslick regarded ‘the measurable tone’ as ‘the primary and essential condition of all music’. Musical sounds, he was saying, can be distinguished from those of nature by the fact that they involve the use of fixed pitches, whereas virtually all natural sounds consist of constantly fluctuating frequencies. And a number of twentieth-century writers have assumed, like Hanslick, that fixed pitches are among the defining features of music. Now it is true that in most of the world’s musical cultures, pitches are not only fixed, but organized into a series of discrete steps. However, this is a generalization about music and not a definition of it, for it is easy to put forward counter-examples. Japanese shakuhachi music and the sanjo music of Korea, for instance, fluctuate constantly around the notional pitches in terms of which the music is organized.",
		"In the classic model of the Sumerian economy, the temple functioned as an administrative authority governing commodity production, collection, and redistribution. The discovery of administrative tablets from the temple complexes at Uruk suggests that token use and consequently writing evolved as a tool of centralized economic governance. Given the lack of archaeological evidence from Uruk-period domestic sites, it is not clear whether individuals also used the system for personal agreements. For that matter, it is not clear how widespread literacy was at its beginnings. The use of identifiable symbols and pictograms on the early tablets is consistent with administrators needing a lexicon that was mutually intelligible by literate and non-literate parties. As cuneiform script became more abstract, literacy must have become increasingly important to ensure one understood what he or she had agreed to.",
		"Choosing similar friends can have a rationale. Assessing the survivability of an environment can be risky (if an environment turns out to be deadly, for instance, it might be too late by the time you found out), so humans have evolved the desire to associate with similar individuals as a way to perform this function efficiently. This is especially useful to a species that lives in so many different sorts of environments. However, the carrying capacity of a given environment places a limit on this strategy. If resources are very limited, the individuals who live in a particular place cannot all do the exact same thing (for example, if there are few trees, people cannot all live in tree houses, or if mangoes are in short supply, people cannot all live solely on a diet of mangoes). A rational strategy would therefore sometimes be to avoid similar members of one’s species.",
		"Thanks to newly developed neuro-imaging technology, we now have access to the specific brain changes that occur during learning. Even though all of our brains contain the same basic structures, our neural networks are as unique as our fingerprints. The latest developmental neuroscience research has shown that the brain is much more malleable throughout life than previously assumed; it develops in response to its own processes, to its immediate and distant “environments,” and to its past and current situations. The brain seeks to create meaning through establishing or refining existing neural networks. When we learn a new fact or skill, our neurons communicate to form networks of connected information. Using this knowledge or skill results in structural changes to allow similar future impulses to travel more quickly and efficiently than others. High-activity synaptic connections are stabilized and strengthened, while connections with relatively low use are weakened and eventually pruned. In this way, our brains are sculpted by our own history of experiences.",
		"Successful integration of an educational technology is marked by that technology being regarded by users as an unobtrusive facilitator of learning, instruction, or performance. When the focus shifts from the technology being used to the educational purpose that technology serves, then that technology is becoming a comfortable and trusted element, and can be regarded as being successfully integrated. Few people give a second thought to the use of a ball-point pen although the mechanisms involved vary―some use a twist mechanism and some use a push button on top, and there are other variations as well. Personal computers have reached a similar level of familiarity for a great many users, but certainly not for all. New and emerging technologies often introduce both fascination and frustration with users. As long as the user’s focus is on the technology itself rather than its use in promoting learning, instruction, or performance, then one ought not to conclude that the technology has been successfully integrated―at least for that user.",
		"Humour involves not just practical disengagement but cognitive disengagement. As long as something is funny, we are for the moment not concerned with whether it is real or fictional, true or false. This is why we give considerable leeway to people telling funny stories. If they are getting extra laughs by exaggerating the silliness of a situation or even by making up a few details, we are happy to grant them comic licence, a kind of poetic licence. Indeed, someone listening to a funny story who tries to correct the teller―‘No, he didn’t spill the spaghetti on the keyboard and the monitor, just on the keyboard’―will probably be told by the other listeners to stop interrupting. The creator of humour is putting ideas into people’s heads for the pleasure those ideas will bring, not to provide accurate information.",
		"News, especially in its televised form, is constituted not only by its choice of topics and stories but by its verbal and visual idioms or modes of address. Presentational styles have been subject to a tension between an informational-educational purpose and the need to engage us entertainingly. While current affairs programmes are often ‘serious’ in tone sticking to the ‘rules’ of balance, more popular programmes adopt a friendly, lighter, idiom in which we are invited to consider the impact of particular news items from the perspective of the ‘average person in the street’. Indeed, contemporary news construction has come to rely on an increased use of faster editing tempos and ‘flashier’ presentational styles including the use of logos, sound-bites, rapid visual cuts and the ‘star quality’ of news readers. Popular formats can be said to enhance understanding by engaging an audience unwilling to endure the longer verbal orientation of older news formats. However, they arguably work to reduce understanding by failing to provide the structural contexts for news events.",
		"Elinor Ostrom found that there are several factors critical to bringing about stable institutional solutions to the problem of the commons. She pointed out, for instance, that the actors affected by the rules for the use and care of resources must have the right to participate in decisions to change the rules. For that reason, the people who monitor and control the behavior of users should also be users and/or have been given a mandate by all users. This is a significant insight, as it shows that prospects are poor for a centrally directed solution to the problem of the commons coming from a state power in comparison with a local solution for which users assume personal responsibility. Ostrom also emphasizes the importance of democratic decision processes and that all users must be given access to local forums for solving problems and conflicts among themselves. Political institutions at central, regional, and local levels must allow users to devise their own regulations and independently ensure observance.",
		"Precision and determinacy are a necessary requirement for all meaningful scientific debate, and progress in the sciences is, to a large extent, the ongoing process of achieving ever greater precision. But historical representation puts a premium on a proliferation of representations, hence not on the refinement of one representation but on the production of an ever more varied set of representations. Historical insight is not a matter of a continuous “narrowing down” of previous options, not of an approximation of the truth, but, on the contrary, is an “explosion” of possible points of view. It therefore aims at the unmasking of previous illusions of determinacy and precision by the production of new and alternative representations, rather than at achieving truth by a careful analysis of what was right and wrong in those previous representations. And from this perspective, the development of historical insight may indeed be regarded by the outsider as a process of creating ever more confusion, a continuous questioning of certainty and precision seemingly achieved already, rather than, as in the sciences, an ever greater approximation to the truth.",
		"There is something deeply paradoxical about the professional status of sports journalism, especially in the medium of print. In discharging their usual responsibilities of description and commentary, reporters’ accounts of sports events are eagerly consulted by sports fans, while in their broader journalistic role of covering sport in its many forms, sports journalists are among the most visible of all contemporary writers. The ruminations of the elite class of ‘celebrity’ sports journalists are much sought after by the major newspapers, their lucrative contracts being the envy of colleagues in other ‘disciplines’ of journalism. Yet sports journalists do not have a standing in their profession that corresponds to the size of their readerships or of their pay packets, with the old saying (now reaching the status of cliché) that sport is the ‘toy department of the news media’ still readily to hand as a dismissal of the worth of what sports journalists do. This reluctance to take sports journalism seriously produces the paradoxical outcome that sports newspaper writers are much read but little admired.",
		"People have always wanted to be around other people and to learn from them. Cities have long been dynamos of social possibility, foundries of art, music, and fashion. Slang, or, if you prefer, “lexical innovation,” has always started in cities―an outgrowth of all those different people so frequently exposed to one another. It spreads outward, in a manner not unlike trans- missible disease, which itself typically “takes off” in cities. If, as the noted linguist Leonard Bloomfield argued, the way a person talks is a “composite result of what he has heard before,” then language innovation would happen where the most people heard and talked to the most other people. Cities drive taste change because they offer the greatest exposure to other people, who not surprisingly are often the creative people cities seem to attract. Media, ever more global, ever more far-reaching, spread language faster to more people.",
		"The entrance to a honeybee colony, often referred to as the dancefloor, is a market place for information about the state of the colony and the environment outside the hive. Studying interactions on the dancefloor provides us with a number of illustrative examples of how individuals changing their own behavior in response to local information allow the colony to regulate its workforce. For example, upon returning to their hive honeybees that have collected water search out a receiver bee to unload their water to within the hive. If this search time is short then the returning bee is more likely to perform a waggle dance to recruit others to the water source. Conversely, if this search time is long then the bee is more likely to give up collecting water. Since receiver bees will only accept water if they require it, either for themselves or to pass on to other bees and brood, this unloading time is correlated with the colony’s overall need of water. Thus the individual water forager’s response to unloading time (up or down) regulates water collection in response to the colony’s need.",
		"We understand that the segregation of our consciousness into present, past, and future is both a fiction and an oddly self-referential framework; your present was part of your mother’s future, and your children’s past will be in part your present. Nothing is generally wrong with structuring our consciousness of time in this conventional manner, and it often works well enough. In the case of climate change, however, the sharp division of time into past, present, and future has been desperately misleading and has, most importantly, hidden from view the extent of the responsibility of those of us alive now. The narrowing of our consciousness of time smooths the way to divorcing ourselves from responsibility for developments in the past and the future with which our lives are in fact deeply intertwined. In the climate case, it is not that we face the facts but then deny our responsibility. It is that the realities are obscured from view by the partitioning of time, and so questions of responsibility toward the past and future do not arise naturally.",
		"Over the last decade the attention given to how children learn to read has foregrounded the nature of textuality, and of the different, interrelated ways in which readers of all ages make texts mean. ‘Reading’ now applies to a greater number of representational forms than at any time in the past: pictures, maps, screens, design graphics and photographs are all regarded as text. In addition to the innovations made possible in picture books by new printing processes, design features also predominate in other kinds, such as books of poetry and information texts. Thus, reading becomes a more complicated kind of interpretation than it was when children’s attention was focused on the printed text, with sketches or pictures as an adjunct. Children now learn from a picture book that words and illustrations complement and enhance each other. Reading is not simply word recognition. Even in the easiest texts, what a sentence ‘says’ is often not what it means.",
		"A musical score within any film can add an additional layer to the film text, which goes beyond simply imitating the action viewed. In films that tell of futuristic worlds, composers, much like sound designers, have added freedom to create a world that is unknown and new to the viewer. However, unlike sound designers, composers often shy away from creating unique pieces that reflect these new worlds and often present musical scores that possess familiar structures and cadences. While it is possible that this may interfere with creativity and a sense of space and time, it in fact aids in viewer access to the film. Through recognizable scores, visions of the future or a galaxy far, far away can be placed within a recognizable context. Such familiarity allows the viewer to be placed in a comfortable space so that the film may then lead the viewer to what is an unfamiliar, but acceptable vision of a world different from their own.",
		"There have been psychological studies in which subjects were shown photographs of people’s faces and asked to identify the expression or state of mind evinced. The results are invariably very mixed. In the 17th century the French painter and theorist Charles Le Brun drew a series of faces illustrating the various emotions that painters could be called upon to represent. What is striking about them is that any number of them could be substituted for one another without loss. What is missing in all this is any setting or context to make the emotion determinate. We must know who this person is, who these other people are, what their relationship is, what is at stake in the scene, and the like. In real life as well as in painting we do not come across just faces; we encounter people in particular situations and our understanding of people cannot somehow be precipitated and held isolated from the social and human circumstances in which they, and we, live and breathe and have our being.",
		"Everyone who drives, walks, or swipes a transit card in a city views herself as a transportation expert from the moment she walks out the front door. And how she views the street tracks pretty closely with how she gets around. That’s why we find so many well-intentioned and civic-minded citizens arguing past one another. At neighborhood meetings in school auditoriums, and in back rooms at libraries and churches, local residents across the nation gather for often-contentious discussions about transportation proposals that would change a city’s streets. And like all politics, all transportation is local and intensely personal. A transit project that could speed travel for tens of thousands of people can be stopped by objections to the loss of a few parking spaces or by the simple fear that the project won’t work. It’s not a challenge of the data or the traffic engineering or the planning. Public debates about streets are typically rooted in emotional assumptions about how a change will affect a person’s commute, ability to park, belief about what is safe and what isn’t, or the bottom line of a local business.",
		"Suppose, on your wedding day, your best man delivers a heart‒warming, moving toast that makes you cry. You later learn he didn’t write it himself but bought it online. Then, would the toast mean less than it did at first, before you knew it was written by a paid professional? Most people would agree the bought wedding toast has less value than an authentic one. Although a bought toast might “work” in the sense of achieving its desired effect, that effect might depend on deception. That is, if you purchased a moving masterpiece of a toast online, you would probably cover it up! If a bought toast depends for its effect on concealing its origin, that’s a reason to suspect it’s a corrupt version of the real thing. Wedding toasts are goods that can, in a sense, be bought. But buying and selling them diminishes their value.",
		"One cool thing about my Uncle Arthur was that he could always pick the best places to camp. One time, we went to Garrison Rock. Uncle Arthur said that the Indians stayed there. On trips like this, he would always have a good story to tell. His stories were always aimed at helping us children use our brains to get out of trouble. For example, one story was about a guy being chased by a big dog. They ran into a field. We kids were thinking that the dog would catch him. But the guy saw a bathtub in the field. He ran to the bathtub and pulled it over himself. The dog just barked and barked until it went away. Then the guy came out of the bathtub, and went home.",
		"Ying Liu wanted to stop his six­-year­-old son, Jing, from watching so much TV. He also wanted to encourage Jing to play the piano and to do more math. The first thing Ying did was prepare. He made a list of his son’s interests. It included, in addition to watching TV, playing with Legos and going to the zoo. He then suggested to his son that he could trade TV time, piano time, and study time for Legos and visits to the zoo. They established a point system, where he got points whenever he watched less TV. Dad and son monitored the process together. As Jing got points, he felt valued and good about himself and spent quality time with Dad.",
		"Your parents may be afraid that you will not spend your allowance wisely. You may make some foolish spending choices, but if you do, the decision to do so is your own and hopefully you will learn from your mistakes. Much of learning occurs through trial and error. Explain to your parents that money is something you will have to deal with for the rest of your life. It is better that you make your mistakes early on rather than later in life. Explain that you will have a family someday and you need to know how to manage your money. Not everything is taught at school!",
		"Though he probably was not the first to do it, Dutch eyeglass maker Hans Lippershey gets credit for putting two lenses on either end of a tube in 1608 and creating a “spyglass.” Even then, it was not Lippershey but his children who discovered that the double lenses made a nearby weathervane look bigger. These early instruments were not much more than toys because their lenses were not very strong. The first person to turn a spyglass toward the sky was an Italian mathematician and professor named Galileo Galilei. Galileo, who heard about the Dutch spyglass and began making his own, realized right away how useful the device could be to armies and sailors. As he made better and better spyglasses, which were later named telescopes, Galileo decided to point one at the Moon.",
		"Foraging is a means of searching for wild food resources. This is a method that has been used for a long time and is possibly the longest method of food searching, tracing back to thousands of years ago. In the past, people commonly foraged for food in forests, riversides, caves, and virtually any place where food could possibly be found. Most of the foods foraged before were root crops, weeds, shrubs, and many more. Now, foraging has become a rising trend. People in today’s fast-paced society engage in this either for necessity or for entertainment. Whatever purpose it may be, people are now slowly but surely getting acquainted with foraging. More and more people find it quite a fulfilling task and very beneficial.",
		"Are you honest with yourself about your strengths and weaknesses? Get to really know yourself and learn what your weaknesses are. Accepting your role in your problems means that you understand the solution lies within you. If you have a weakness in a certain area, get educated and do what you have to do to improve things for yourself. If your social image is terrible, look within yourself and take the necessary steps to improve it, TODAY. You have the ability to choose how to respond to life. Decide today to end all the excuses, and stop lying to yourself about what is going on. The beginning of growth comes when you begin to personally accept responsibility for your choices.",
		"My dad worked very late hours as a musician ― until about three in the morning ― so he slept late on weekends. As a result, we didn’t have much of a relationship when I was young other than him constantly nagging me to take care of chores like mowing the lawn and cutting the hedges, which I hated. He was a responsible man dealing with an irresponsible kid. Memories of how we interacted seem funny to me today. For example, one time he told me to cut the grass and I decided to do just the front yard and postpone doing the back, but then it rained for a couple days and the backyard grass became so high I had to cut it with a sickle. That took so long that by the time I was finished, the front yard was too high to mow, and so on.",
		"The belief that humans have morality and animals don’t is such a longstanding assumption that it could well be called a habit of mind, and bad habits, as we all know, are extremely hard to break. A lot of people have caved in to this assumption because it is easier to deny morality to animals than to deal with the complex effects of the possibility that animals have moral behavior. The historical tendency, framed in the outdated dualism of us versus them, is strong enough to make a lot of people cling to the status quo. Denial of who animals are conveniently allows for maintaining false stereotypes about the cognitive and emotional capacities of animals. Clearly a major paradigm shift is needed, because the lazy acceptance of habits of mind has a strong influence on how animals are understood and treated.",
		"What could be wrong with the compliment “I’m so proud of you”? Plenty. Just as it is misguided to offer your child false praise, it is also a mistake to reward all of his accomplishments. Although rewards sound so positive, they can often lead to negative consequences. It is because they can take away from the love of learning. If you consistently reward a child for her accomplishments, she starts to focus more on getting the reward than on what she did to earn it. The focus of her excitement shifts from enjoying learning itself to pleasing you. If you applaud every time your child identifies a letter, she may become a praise lover who eventually becomes less interested in learning the alphabet for its own sake than for hearing you applaud.",
		"Bad lighting can increase stress on your eyes, as can light that is too bright, or light that shines directly into your eyes. Fluorescent lighting can also be tiring. What you may not appreciate is that the quality of light may also be important. Most people are happiest in bright sunshine―this may cause a release of chemicals in the body that bring a feeling of emotional well­being. Artificial light, which typically contains only a few wavelengths of light, does not seem to have the same effect on mood that sunlight has. Try experimenting with working by a window or using full spectrum bulbs in your desk lamp. You will probably find that this improves the quality of your working environment.",
		"Improved consumer water consciousness may be the cheapest way to save the most water, but it is not the only way consumers can contribute to water conservation. With technology progressing faster than ever before, there are plenty of devices that consumers can install in their homes to save more. More than 35 models of high-efficiency toilets are on the U.S. market today, some of which use less than 1.3 gallons per flush. Starting at $200, these toilets are affordable and can help the average consumer save hundreds of gallons of water per year. Appliances officially approved as most efficient are tagged with the Energy Star logo to alert the shopper. Washing machines with that rating use 18 to 25 gallons of water per load, compared with older machines that use 40 gallons. High-efficiency dishwashers save even more water. These machines use up to 50 percent less water than older models.",
		"Each species of animals can detect a different range of odours. No species can detect all the molecules that are present in the environment in which it lives―there are some things that we cannot smell but which some other animals can, and vice versa. There are also differences between individuals, relating to the ability to smell an odour, or how pleasant it seems. For example, some people like the taste of coriander― known as cilantro in the USA―while others find it soapy and unpleasant. This effect has an underlying genetic component due to differences in the genes controlling our sense of smell. Ultimately, the selection of scents detected by a given species, and how that odour is perceived, will depend upon the animal’s ecology. The response profile of each species will enable it to locate sources of smell that are relevant to it and to respond accordingly.",
		"Although there is usually a correct way of holding and playing musical instruments, the most important instruction to begin with is that they are not toys and that they must be looked after. Allow children time to explore ways of handling and playing the instruments for themselves before showing them. Finding different ways to produce sounds is an important stage of musical exploration. Correct playing comes from the desire to find the most appropriate sound quality and find the most comfortable playing position so that one can play with control over time. As instruments and music become more complex, learning appropriate playing techniques becomes increasingly relevant.",
		"We usually get along best with people who we think are like us. In fact, we seek them out. It’s why places like Little Italy, Chinatown, and Koreatown exist. But I’m not just talking about race, skin color, or religion. I’m talking about people who share our values and look at the world the same way we do. As the saying goes, birds of a feather flock together. This is a very common human tendency which is rooted in how our species developed. Imagine you are walking out in a forest. You would be conditioned to avoid something unfamiliar or foreign because there is a high likelihood that it would be interested in killing you. Similarities make us relate better to other people because we think they’ll understand us on a deeper level than other people.",
		"There is a reason the title “Monday Morning Quarterback” exists. Just read the comments on social media from fans discussing the weekend’s games, and you quickly see how many people believe they could play, coach, and manage sport teams more successfully than those on the field. This goes for the boardroom as well. Students and professionals with years of training and specialized degrees in sport business may also find themselves being given advice on how to do their jobs from friends, family, or even total strangers without any expertise. Executives in sport management have decades of knowledge and experience in their respective fields. However, many of them face criticism from fans and community members telling them how to run their business. Very few people tell their doctor how to perform surgery or their accountant how to prepare their taxes, but many people provide feedback on how sport organizations should be managed.",
		"Take time to read the comics. This is worthwhile not just because they will make you laugh but because they contain wisdom about the nature of life. Charlie Brown and Blondie are part of my morning routine and help me to start the day with a smile. When you read the comics section of the newspaper, cut out a cartoon that makes you laugh. Post it wherever you need it most, such as on your refrigerator or at work—so that every time you see it, you will smile and feel your spirit lifted. Share your favorites with your friends and family so that everyone can get a good laugh, too. Take your comics with you when you go to visit sick friends who can really use a good laugh.",
		"It would be hard to overstate how important meaningful work is to human beings—work that provides a sense of fulfillment and empowerment. Those who have found deeper meaning in their careers find their days much more energizing and satisfying, and count their employment as one of their greatest sources of joy and pride. Sonya Lyubomirsky, professor of psychology at the University of California, has conducted numerous workplace studies showing that when people are more fulfilled on the job, they not only produce higher quality work and a greater output, but also generally earn higher incomes. Those most satisfied with their work are also much more likely to be happier with their lives overall. For her book Happiness at Work, researcher Jessica Pryce­-Jones conducted a study of 3,000 workers in seventy­-nine countries, finding that those who took greater satisfaction from their work were 150 percent more likely to have a happier life overall.",
		"It’s important to remember that good decisions can still lead to bad outcomes. Here is an example. Soon after I got out of school, I was offered a job. I wasn’t sure that was a great fit for me. After carefully considering the opportunity, I decided to turn it down. I thought that I would be able to find another job that was a better match. Unfortunately, the economy soon grew worse quickly and I spent months looking for another job. I kicked myself for not taking that position, which started to look more and more appealing. I had made a good decision, based upon all the information I had at the time, but in the short run it didn’t lead to a great outcome.",
		"In perceiving changes, we tend to regard the most recent ones as the most revolutionary. This is often inconsistent with the facts. Recent progress in telecommunications technologies is not more revolutionary than what happened in the late nineteenth century in relative terms. Moreover, in terms of the consequent economic and social changes, the Internet revolution has not been as important as the washing machine and other household appliances. These things, by vastly reducing the amount of work needed for household chores, allowed women to enter the labor market and virtually got rid of professions like domestic service. We should not “put the telescope backward” when we look into the past and underestimate the old and overestimate the new. This leads us to make all sorts of wrong decisions about national economic policy, corporate policies, and our own careers.",
		"Plastic is extremely slow to degrade and tends to float, which allows it to travel in ocean currents for thousands of miles. Most plastics break down into smaller and smaller pieces when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light, forming microplastics. These microplastics are very difficult to measure once they are small enough to pass through the nets typically used to collect them. Their impacts on the marine environment and food webs are still poorly understood. These tiny particles are known to be eaten by various animals and to get into the food chain. Because most of the plastic particles in the ocean are so small, there is no practical way to clean up the ocean. One would have to filter enormous amounts of water to collect a relatively small amount of plastic.",
		"There are many methods for finding answers to the mysteries of the universe, and science is only one of these. However, science is unique. Instead of making guesses, scientists follow a system designed to prove if their ideas are true or false. They constantly reexamine and test their theories and conclusions. Old ideas are replaced when scientists find new information that they cannot explain. Once somebody makes a discovery, others review it carefully before using the information in their own research. This way of building new knowledge on older discoveries ensures that scientists correct their mistakes. Armed with scientific knowledge, people build tools and machines that transform the way we live, making our lives much easier and better.",
		"Non-verbal communication is not a substitute for verbal communication. Rather, it should function as a supplement, serving to enhance the richness of the content of the message that is being passed across. Non-verbal communication can be useful in situations where speaking may be impossible or inappropriate. Imagine you are in an uncomfortable position while talking to an individual. Non-verbal communication will help you get the message across to him or her to give you some time off the conversation to be comfortable again. Another advantage of non-verbal communication is that it offers you the opportunity to express emotions and attitudes properly. Without the aid of non-verbal communication, there are several aspects of your nature and personality that will not be adequately expressed. So, again, it does not substitute verbal communication but rather complements it.",
		"“You are what you eat.” That phrase is often used to show the relationship between the foods you eat and your physical health. But do you really know what you are eating when you buy processed foods, canned foods, and packaged goods? Many of the manufactured products made today contain so many chemicals and artificial ingredients that it is sometimes difficult to know exactly what is inside them. Fortunately, now there are food labels. Food labels are a good way to find the information about the foods you eat. Labels on food are like the table of contents found in books. The main purpose of food labels is to inform you what is inside the food you are purchasing.",
		"Positively or negatively, our parents and families are powerful influences on us. But even stronger, especially when we’re young, are our friends. We often choose friends as a way of expanding our sense of identity beyond our families. As a result, the pressure to conform to the standards and expectations of friends and other social groups is likely to be intense. Judith Rich Harris, who is a developmental psychologist, argues that three main forces shape our development: personal temperament, our parents, and our peers. The influence of peers, she argues, is much stronger than that of parents. “The world that children share with their peers,” she says, “is what shapes their behavior and modifies the characteristics they were born with, and hence determines the sort of people they will be when they grow up.”",
		"Although it is obvious that part of our assessment of food is its visual appearance, it is perhaps surprising how visual input can override taste and smell. People find it very difficult to correctly identify fruit­-flavoured drinks if the colour is wrong, for instance an orange drink that is coloured green. Perhaps even more striking is the experience of wine tasters. One study of Bordeaux University students of wine and wine making revealed that they chose tasting notes appropriate for red wines, such as ‘prune and chocolate’, when they were given white wine coloured with a red dye. Experienced New Zealand wine experts were similarly tricked into thinking that the white wine Chardonnay was in fact a red wine, when it had been coloured with a red dye.",
		"There have been occasions in which you have observed a smile and you could sense it was not genuine. The most obvious way of identifying a genuine smile from an insincere one is that a fake smile primarily only affects the lower half of the face, mainly with the mouth alone. The eyes don’t really get involved. Take the opportunity to look in the mirror and manufacture a smile using the lower half your face only. When you do this, judge how happy your face really looks―is it genuine? A genuine smile will impact on the muscles and wrinkles around the eyes and less noticeably, the skin between the eyebrow and upper eyelid is lowered slightly with true enjoyment. The genuine smile can impact on the entire face.",
		"An economic theory of Say’s Law holds that everything that’s made will get sold. The money from anything that’s produced is used to buy something else. There can never be a situation in which a firm finds that it can’t sell its goods and so has to dismiss workers and close its factories. Therefore, recessions and unemployment are impossible. Picture the level of spending like the level of water in a bath. Say’s Law applies because people use all their earnings to buy things. But what happens if people don’t spend all their money, saving some of it instead? Savings are a ‘leakage’ of spending from the economy. You’re probably imagining the water level now falling, so there’s less spending in the economy. That would mean firms producing less and dismissing some of their workers.",
		"The reduction of minerals in our food is the result of using pesticides and fertilizers that kill off beneficial bacteria, earthworms, and bugs in the soil that create many of the essential nutrients in the first place and prevent the uptake of nutrients into the plant. Fertilizing crops with nitrogen and potassium has led to declines in magnesium, zinc, iron and iodine. For example, there has been on average about a 30% decline in the magnesium content of wheat. This is partly due to potassium being a blocker against magnesium absorption by plants. Lower magnesium levels in soil also occur with acidic soils and around 70% of the farmland on earth is now acidic. Thus, the overall characteristics of soil determine the accumulation of minerals in plants. Indeed, nowadays our soil is less healthy and so are the plants grown on it.",
		"Despite all the high­-tech devices that seem to deny the need for paper, paper use in the United States has nearly doubled recently. We now consume more paper than ever: 400 million tons globally and growing. Paper is not the only resource that we are using more of. Technological advances often come with the promise of using fewer materials. However, the reality is that they have historically caused more materials use, making us dependent on more natural resources. The world now consumes far more “stuff” than it ever has. We use twenty­-seven times more industrial minerals, such as gold, copper, and rare metals, than we did just over a century ago. We also each individually use more resources. Much of that is due to our high­-tech lifestyle.",
		"The human brain, it turns out, has shrunk in mass by about 10 percent since it peak in size 15,000-30,000 years ago. One possible reason is that many thousands of years ago humans lived in a world of dangerous predators where they had to have their wits about them at all times to avoid being killed. Today, we have effectively domesticated ourselves and many of the tasks of survival ― from avoiding immediate death to building shelters to obtaining food ― has been outsourced to the wider society. We are smaller than our ancestors too, and it is a characteristic of domestic animals that they are generally smaller than their wild cousins. None of this may mean we are dumber― brain size is not necessarily an indicator of human intelligence ― but it may mean that our brains today are wired up differently, and perhaps more efficiently, than those of our ancestors.",
		"You may have seen headlines in the news about some of the things machines powered by artificial intelligence can do. However, if you were to consider all the tasks that AI-powered machines could actually perform, it would be quite mind-blowing! One of the key features of artificial intelligence is that it enables machines to learn new things, rather than requiring programming specific to new tasks. Therefore, the core difference between computers of the future and those of the past is that future computers will be able to learn and self-improve. In the near future, smart virtual assistants will know more about you than your closest friends and family members do. Can you imagine how that might change our lives? These kinds of changes are exactly why it is so important to recognize the implications that new technologies will have for our world.",
		"The most noticeable human characteristic projected onto animals is that they can talk in human language. Physically, animal cartoon characters and toys made after animals are also most often deformed in such a way as to resemble humans. This is achieved by showing them with humanlike facial features and deformed front legs to resemble human hands. In more recent animated movies the trend has been to show the animals in a more “natural” way. However, they still use their front legs like human hands (for example, lions can pick up and lift small objects with one paw), and they still talk with an appropriate facial expression. A general strategy that is used to make the animal characters more emotionally appealing, both to children and adults, is to give them enlarged and deformed childlike features.",
		"Although praise is one of the most powerful tools available for improving young children’s behavior, it is equally powerful for improving your child’s self­-esteem. Preschoolers believe what their parents tell them in a very profound way. They do not yet have the cognitive sophistication to reason analytically and reject false information. If a preschool boy consistently hears from his mother that he is smart and a good helper, he is likely to incorporate that information into his self­-image. Thinking of himself as a boy who is smart and knows how to do things is likely to make him endure longer in problem­-solving efforts and increase his confidence in trying new and difficult tasks. Similarly, thinking of himself as the kind of boy who is a good helper will make him more likely to volunteer to help with tasks at home and at preschool.",
		"Some countries have proposed tougher guidelines for determining brain death when transplantation―transferring organs to others ― is under consideration. In several European countries, there are legal requirements which specify that a whole team of doctors must agree over the diagnosis of death in the case of a potential donor. The reason for these strict regulations for diagnosing brain death in potential organ donors is, no doubt, to ease public fears of a premature diagnosis of brain death for the purpose of obtaining organs. But it is questionable whether these requirements reduce public suspicions as much as they create them. They certainly maintain mistaken beliefs that diagnosing brain death is an unreliable process lacking precision. As a matter of consistency, at least, criteria for diagnosing the deaths of organ donors should be exactly the same as for those for whom immediate burial or cremation is intended.",
		"Whenever I look into my daughter Emily’s face, I think about the power of fatherhood. Her face reminds me that I have given her more than just my name. Like me, she has freckles stretching across the bridge of her nose almost like a Band­Aid. The skin around her eyes forms small and thin lines, and the lines match mine. “When Emily smiles,” my mother tells me, “she looks just like you.” Other things in her are reflections of me. I see myself most clearly in her eyes, the windows to her soul. Like me, Emily has a drive to succeed and will try anything. “Who needs to wait for instructions?” she used to tell herself as she attempted to do the high bar in gymnastics class; more than once, she failed. Also, more than once, she succeeded.",
		"Jack Welch is considered to be one of the USA’s top business leaders. In a gesture that was at once symbolic and real, Welch directed the ceremonial burning of the old­-fashioned GE Blue Books. The Blue Books were a series of management training manuals that told how GE managers were to get tasks done in the organization. Despite the fact that these books for training had not been used for some 15 years, they still had great influence over the actions of GE managers. Citing the need for managers to write their own answers to day­-to­-day management challenges, Welch swept away the old order by removing the Blue Books from the organization’s culture. Now, GE managers are taught to find their own solutions rather than look them up in a dusty old book.",
		"Language is one of the primary features that distinguishes humans from other animals. Many animals, including dolphins, whales, and birds, do indeed communicate with one another through patterned systems of sounds, scents, and other chemicals, or movements. Furthermore, some nonhuman primates have been taught to use sign language to communicate with humans. However, the complexity of human language, its ability to convey nuanced emotions and ideas, and its importance for our existence as social animals set it apart from the communication systems used by other animals. In many ways, language is the essence of culture. It provides the single most common variable by which different cultural groups are identified. Language not only facilitates the cultural diffusion of innovations, it also helps to shape the way we think about, perceive, and name our environment.",
		"Debating is as old as language itself and has taken many forms throughout human history. In ancient Rome, debate in the Senate was critical to the conduct of civil society and the justice system. In Greece, advocates for policy changes would routinely make their cases before citizen juries composed of hundreds of Athenians. In India, debate was used to settle religious controversies and was a very popular form of entertainment. Indian kings sponsored great debating contests, offering prizes for the winners. China has its own ancient and distinguished tradition of debate. Beginning in the 2nd Century A.D., Taoist and Confucian scholars engaged in a practice known as ‘pure talk’ in which they debated spiritual and philosophical issues before audiences in contests that might last for a day and a night.",
		"Some researchers assumed early human beings ate mainly the muscle flesh of animals, as we do today. By “meat,” they meant the muscle of the animal. Yet focusing on the muscle appears to be a relatively recent phenomenon. In every history on the subject, the evidence suggests that early human populations preferred the fat and organ meat of the animal over its muscle meat. Vihjalmur Stefansson, an arctic explorer, found that the Inuit were careful to save fatty meat and organs for human consumption while giving muscle meat to the dogs. In this way, humans ate as other large, meat­-eating mammals eat. Lions and tigers, for instance, first eat the blood, hearts, livers, and brains of the animals they kill, often leaving the muscle meat for eagles. These organs tend to be much higher in fat.",
		"The process of job advancement in the field of sports is often said to be shaped like a pyramid. That is, at the wide base are many jobs with high school athletic teams, while at the narrow tip are the few, highly desired jobs with professional organizations. Thus there are many sports jobs altogether, but the competition becomes increasingly tough as one works their way up. The salaries of various positions reflect this pyramid model. For example, high school football coaches are typically teachers who are paid a little extra for their afterclass work. But coaches of the same sport at big universities can earn more than $1 million a year, causing the salaries of college presidents to look small in comparison. One degree higher up is the National Football League, where head coaches can earn many times more than their best­-paid campus counterparts.",
		"The ability to think about why things work and what may be causing problems when events do not go as expected seems like an obvious aspect of the way we think. It is interesting that this ability to think about why things happen is one of the key abilities that separates human abilities from those of just about every other animal on the planet. Asking why allows people to create explanations. Issac Newton didn’t just see an apple fall from a tree. He used that observation to help him figure out why it fell. Your car mechanic doesn’t just observe that your car is not working. He figures out why it is not working using knowledge about why it usually does work properly. And anyone who has spent time with a five­-year­-old knows that children this age can test the limits of your patience by trying to get explanations for why everything works as it does.",
		"When I was young, my parents worshipped medical doctors as if they were exceptional beings possessing godlike qualities. But I never dreamed of pursuing a career in medicine until I entered the hospital for a rare disease. I became a medical curiosity, attracting some of the area’s top specialists to look in on me and review my case. As a patient, and a teenager eager to return to college, I asked each doctor who examined me, “What caused my disease?” “How will you make me better?” The typical response was nonverbal. They shook their heads and walked out of my room. I remember thinking to myself, “Well, I could do that.” When it became clear to me that no doctor could answer my basic questions, I walked out of the hospital against medical advice. Returning to college, I pursued medicine with a great passion.",
		"Architecture is generally conceived, designed, and realized in response to an existing set of conditions. These conditions may be purely functional in nature, or they may also reflect in varying degrees the social, political, and economic climate. In any case, it is assumed that the existing set of conditions is much less satisfactory and that a new set of conditions would be desirable. The initial phase of any design process is the recognition of a problematic condition and the decision to find a solution to it. Design is above all a purposeful endeavor. A designer must first document the existing conditions of a problem and collect relevant data to be analyzed. This is the critical phase of the design process since the nature of a solution is related to how a problem is defined.",
		"Before the washing machine was invented, people used washboards to scrub, or they carried their laundry to riverbanks and streams, where they beat and rubbed it against rocks. Such backbreaking labor is still commonplace in parts of the world, but for most homeowners the work is now done by a machine that automatically regulates water temperature, measures out the detergent, washes, rinses, and spin­-dries. With its electrical and mechanical system, the washing machine is one of the most technologically advanced examples of a large household appliance. It not only cleans clothes, but it does so with far less water, detergent, and energy than washing by hand requires. Compared with the old washers that squeezed out excess water by feeding clothes through rollers, modern washers are indeed an electrical­-mechanical phenomenon.",
		"Why do we often feel that others are paying more attention to us than they really are? The spotlight effect means seeing ourselves at center stage, thus intuitively overestimating the extent to which others’ attention is aimed at us. Timothy Lawson explored the spotlight effect by having college students change into a sweatshirt with a big popular logo on the front before meeting a group of peers. Nearly 40 percent of them were sure the other students would remember what the shirt said, but only 10 percent actually did. Most observers did not even notice that the students changed sweatshirts after leaving the room for a few minutes. In another experiment, even noticeable clothes, such as a T-shirt with singer Barry Manilow on it, provoked only 23 percent of observers to notice―far fewer than the 50 percent estimated by the students sporting the 1970s soft rock singer on their chests.",
		"The competition to sell manuscripts to publishers is fierce. I would estimate that less than one percent of the material sent to publishers is ever published. Since so much material is being written, publishers can be very selective. The material they choose to publish must not only have commercial value, but be very competently written and free of editing and factual errors. Any manuscript that contains errors stands little chance at being accepted for publication. Most publishers will not want to waste time with writers whose material contains too many mistakes.",
		"Cutting costs can improve profitability but only up to a point. If the manufacturer cuts costs so deeply that doing so harms the product’s quality, then the increased profitability will be short­-lived. A better approach is to improve productivity. If businesses can get more production from the same number of employees, they’re basically tapping into free money. They get more product to sell, and the price of each product falls. As long as the machinery or employee training needed for productivity improvements costs less than the value of the productivity gains, it’s an easy investment for any business to make. Productivity improvements are as important to the economy as they are to the individual business that’s making them. Productivity improvements generally raise the standard of living for everyone and are a good indication of a healthy economy.",
		"What comes to mind when we think about time? Let us go back to 4,000 B.C. in ancient China where some early clocks were invented. To demonstrate the idea of time to temple students, Chinese priests used to dangle a rope from the temple ceiling with knots representing the hours. They would light it with a flame from the bottom so that it burnt evenly, indicating the passage of time. Many temples burnt down in those days. The priests were obviously not too happy about that until someone invented a clock made of water buckets. It worked by punching holes in a large bucket full of water, with markings representing the hours, to allow water to flow out at a constant rate. The temple students would then measure time by how fast the bucket drained. It was much better than burning ropes for sure, but more importantly, it taught the students that once time was gone, it could never be recovered.",
		"Although sports nutrition is a fairly new academic discipline, there have always been recommendations made to athletes about foods that could enhance athletic performance. One ancient Greek athlete is reported to have eaten dried figs to enhance training. There are reports that marathon runners in the 1908 Olympics drank cognac to improve performance. The teenage running phenomenon, Mary Decker, surprised the sports world in the 1970s when she reported that she ate a plate of spaghetti noodles the night before a race. Such practices may be suggested to athletes because of their real or perceived benefits by individuals who excelled in their sports. Obviously, some of these practices, such as drinking alcohol during a marathon, are no longer recommended, but others, such as a high­-carbohydrate meal the night before a competition, have stood the test of time.",
		"Are cats liquid or solid? That’s the kind of question that could win a scientist an Ig Nobel Prize, a parody of the Nobel Prize that honors research that “makes people laugh, then think.” But it wasn’t with this in mind that Marc­Antoine Fardin, a physicist at Paris Diderot University, set out to find out whether house cats flow. Fardin noticed that these furry pets can adapt to the shape of the container they sit in similarly to what fluids such as water do. So he applied rheology, the branch of physics that deals with the deformation of matter, to calculate the time it takes for cats to take up the space of a vase or bathroom sink. The conclusion? Cats can be either liquid or solid, depending on the circumstances. A cat in a small box will behave like a fluid, filling up all the space. But a cat in a bathtub full of water will try to minimize its contact with it and behave very much like a solid.",
		"Application of Buddhist-style mindfulness to Western psychology came primarily from the research of Jon Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center. He initially took on the difficult task of treating chronic-pain patients, many of whom had not responded well to traditional pain-management therapy. In many ways, such treatment seems completely paradoxical — you teach people to deal with pain by helping them to become more aware of it! However, the key is to help people let go of the constant tension that accompanies their fighting of pain, a struggle that actually prolongs their awareness of pain. Mindfulness meditation allowed many of these people to increase their sense of well-being and to experience a better quality of life. How so? Because such meditation is based on the principle that if we try to ignore or repress unpleasant thoughts or sensations, then we only end up increasing their intensity.",
		"If there’s one thing koalas are good at, it’s sleeping. For a long time many scientists suspected that koalas were so lethargic because the compounds in eucalyptus leaves kept the cute little animals in a drugged­-out state. But more recent research has shown that the leaves are simply so low in nutrients that koalas have almost no energy. Therefore they tend to move as little as possible—and when they do move, they often look as though they’re in slow motion. They rest sixteen to eighteen hours a day and spend most of that unconscious. In fact, koalas spend little time thinking; their brains actually appear to have shrunk over the last few centuries. The koala is the only known animal whose brain only fills half of its skull.",
		"Trying to produce everything yourself would mean you are using your time and resources to produce many things for which you are a high­-cost provider. This would translate into lower production and income. For example, even though most doctors might be good at record keeping and arranging appointments, it is generally in their interest to hire someone to perform these services. The time doctors use to keep records is time they could have spent seeing patients. Because the time spent with their patients is worth a lot, the opportunity cost of record keeping for doctors will be high. Thus, doctors will almost always find it advantageous to hire someone else to keep and manage their records. Moreover, when the doctor specializes in the provision of physician services and hires someone who has a comparative advantage in record keeping, costs will be lower and joint output larger than would otherwise be achievable.",
		"Not only are humans unique in the sense that they began to use an ever­widening tool set, we are also the only species on this planet that has constructed forms of complexity that use external energy sources. This was a fundamental new development, for which there were no precedents in big history. This capacity may first have emerged between 1.5 and 0.5 million years ago, when humans began to control fire. From at least 50,000 years ago, some of the energy stored in air and water flows was used for navigation and, much later, also for powering the first machines. Around 10,000 years ago, humans learned to cultivate plants and tame animals and thus control these important matter and energy flows. Very soon, they also learned to use animal muscle power. About 250 years ago, fossil fuels began to be used on a large scale for powering machines of many different kinds, thereby creating the virtually unlimited amounts of artificial complexity that we are familiar with today.",
		"There is a reason why so many of us are attracted to recorded music these days, especially considering personal music players are common and people are listening to music through headphones a lot. Recording engineers and musicians have learned to create special effects that tickle our brains by exploiting neural circuits that evolved to discern important features of our auditory environment. These special effects are similar in principle to 3-D art, motion pictures, or visual illusions, none of which have been around long enough for our brains to have evolved special mechanisms to perceive them. Rather, 3-D art, motion pictures, and visual illusions leverage perceptual systems that are in place to accomplish other things. Because they use these neural circuits in novel ways, we find them especially interesting. The same is true of the way that modern recordings are made.",
		"Commercial airplanes generally travel airways similar to roads, although they are not physical structures. Airways have fixed widths and defined altitudes, which separate traffic moving in opposite directions. Vertical separation of aircraft allows some flights to pass over airports while other processes occur below. Air travel usually covers long distances, with short periods of intense pilot activity at takeoff and landing and long periods of lower pilot activity while in the air, the portion of the flight known as the “long haul.” During the long­haul portion of a flight, pilots spend more time assessing aircraft status than searching out nearby planes. This is because collisions between aircraft usually occur in the surrounding area of airports, while crashes due to aircraft malfunction tend to occur during long­haul flight.",
		"Every farmer knows that the hard part is getting the field prepared. Inserting seeds and watching them grow is easy. In the case of science and industry, the community prepares the field, yet society tends to give all the credit to the individual who happens to plant a successful seed. Planting a seed does not necessarily require overwhelming intelligence; creating an environment that allows seeds to prosper does. We need to give more credit to the community in science, politics, business, and daily life. Martin Luther King Jr. was a great man. Perhaps his greatest strength was his ability to inspire people to work together to achieve, against all odds, revolutionary changes in society’s perception of race and in the fairness of the law. But to really understand what he accomplished requires looking beyond the man. Instead of treating him as the manifestation of everything great, we should appreciate his role in allowing America to show that it can be great.",
		"All social interactions require some common ground upon which the involved parties can coordinate their behavior. In the interdependent groups in which humans and other primates live, individuals must have even greater common ground to establish and maintain social relationships. This common ground is morality. This is why morality often is defined as a shared set of standards for judging right and wrong in the conduct of social relationships. No matter how it is conceptualized―whether as trustworthiness, cooperation, justice, or caring―morality is always about the treatment of people in social relationships. This is likely why there is surprising agreement across a wide range of perspectives that a shared sense of morality is necessary to social relations. Evolutionary biologists, sociologists, and philosophers all seem to agree with social psychologists that the interdependent relationships within groups that humans depend on are not possible without a shared morality.",
		"One of the keys to insects’ successful survival in the open air lies in their outer covering—a hard waxy layer that helps prevent their tiny bodies from dehydrating. To take oxygen from the air, they use narrow breathing holes in the body-segments, which take in air passively and can be opened and closed as needed. Instead of blood contained in vessels, they have free-flowing hemolymph, which helps keep their bodies rigid, aids movement, and assists the transportation of nutrients and waste materials to the appropriate parts of the body. The nervous system is modular—in a sense, each of the body segments has its own individual and autonomous brain —and some other body systems show a similar modularization. These are just a few of the many ways in which insect bodies are structured and function completely differently from our own.",
		"While reflecting on the needs of organizations, leaders, and families today, we realize that one of the unique characteristics is inclusivity. Why? Because inclusivity supports what everyone ultimately wants from their relationships: collaboration. Yet the majority of leaders, organizations, and families are still using the language of the old paradigm in which one person—typically the oldest, most educated, and/or wealthiest—makes all the decisions, and their decisions rule with little discussion or inclusion of others, resulting in exclusivity. Today, this person could be a director, CEO, or other senior leader of an organization. There is no need for others to present their ideas because they are considered inadequate. Yet research shows that exclusivity in problem solving, even with a genius, is not as effective as inclusivity, where everyone’s ideas are heard and a solution is developed through collaboration.",
		"While working as a research fellow at Harvard, B. F. Skinner carried out a series of experiments on rats, using an invention that later became known as a “Skinner box.” A rat was placed in one of these boxes, which had a special bar fitted on the inside. Every time the rat pressed this bar, it was presented with food. The rate of bar‑pressing was automatically recorded. Initially, the rat might press the bar accidentally, or simply out of curiosity, and as a consequence receive some food. Over time, the rat learned that food appeared whenever the bar was pressed, and began to press it purposefully in order to be fed. Comparing results from rats given the “positive reinforcement” of food for their bar‑pressing behavior with those that were not, or were presented with food at different rates, it became clear that when food appeared as a consequence of the rat’s actions, this influenced its future behavior.",
		"Organisms living in the deep sea have adapted to the high pressure by storing water in their bodies, some consisting almost entirely of water. Most deep­sea organisms lack gas bladders. They are cold­blooded organisms that adjust their body temperature to their environment, allowing them to survive in the cold water while maintaining a low metabolism. Many species lower their metabolism so much that they are able to survive without food for long periods of time, as finding the sparse food that is available expends a lot of energy. Many predatory fish of the deep sea are equipped with enormous mouths and sharp teeth, enabling them to hold on to prey and overpower it. Some predators hunting in the residual light zone of the ocean have excellent visual capabilities, while others are able to create their own light to attract prey or a mating partner.",
		"Anchoring bias describes the cognitive error you make when you tend to give more weight to information arriving early in a situation compared to information arriving later―regardless of the relative quality or relevance of that initial information. Whatever data is presented to you first when you start to look at a situation can form an “anchor” and it becomes significantly more challenging to alter your mental course away from this anchor than it logically should be. A classic example of anchoring bias in emergency medicine is “triage bias,” where whatever the first impression you develop, or are given, about a patient tends to influence all subsequent providers seeing that patient. For example, imagine two patients presenting for emergency care with aching jaw pain that occasionally extends down to their chest. Differences in how the intake providers label the chart—“jaw pain” vs. “chest pain,” for example— create anchors that might result in significant differences in how the patients are treated.",
		"Despite abundant warnings that we shouldn’t measure ourselves against others, most of us still do. We’re not only meaning­-seeking creatures but social ones as well, constantly making interpersonal comparisons to evaluate ourselves, improve our standing, and enhance our self­-esteem. But the problem with social comparison is that it often backfires. When comparing ourselves to someone who’s doing better than we are, we often feel inadequate for not doing as well. This sometimes leads to what psychologists call malignant envy, the desire for someone to meet with misfortune (“I wish she didn’t have what she has”). Also, comparing ourselves with someone who’s doing worse than we are risks scorn, the feeling that others are something undeserving of our beneficence (“She’s beneath my notice”). Then again, comparing ourselves to others can also lead to benign envy, the longing to reproduce someone else’s accomplishments without wishing them ill (“I wish I had what she has”), which has been shown in some circumstances to inspire and motivate us to increase our efforts in spite of a recent failure.",
		"Even though institutions like the World Bank use wealth to differentiate between “developed” and “developing” countries, they also agree that development is more than economic growth. “Development” can also include the social and environmental changes that are caused by or accompany economic growth, some of which are positive and thus may be negative. Awareness has grown—and continues to grow—that the question of how economic growth is affecting people and the planet needs to be addressed. Countries are slowly learning that it is cheaper and causes much less suffering to try to reduce the harmful effects of an economic activity or project at the beginning, when it is planned, than after the damage appears. To do this is not easy and is always imperfect. But an awareness of the need for such an effort indicates a greater understanding and moral concern than did the previous widespread attitude that focused only on creating new products and services.",
		"By noticing the relation between their own actions and resultant external changes, infants develop self‐efficacy, a sense that they are agents of the perceived changes. Although infants can notice the effect of their behavior on the physical environment, it is in early social interactions that infants most readily perceive the consequence of their actions. People have perceptual characteristics that virtually assure that infants will orient toward them. They have visually contrasting and moving faces. They produce sound, provide touch, and have interesting smells. In addition, people engage with infants by exaggerating their facial expressions and inflecting their voices in ways that infants find fascinating. But most importantly, these antics are responsive to infants’ vocalizations, facial expressions, and gestures; people vary the pace and level of their behavior in response to infant actions. Consequentially, early social interactions provide a context where infants can easily notice the effect of their behavior.",
		"Pre-emption means that a strategy is designed to prevent a rival from starting some particular activity. In some case a pre-emptive move may simply be an announcement of some intent that might discourage rivals from doing the same. The idea of pre-emption implies that timing is sometimes very important—a decision or an action at one point in time might be much more rewarding than doing it at a different time point. Pre-emption may involve up-weighting advertising for a period before and during when a new entrant launches into a market. The intent is to make it more difficult for the new entrant’s advertising to make an impression on potential buyers. Product proliferation is another potential pre-emption strategy. The general idea is to launch a large variety of product variants so that there is very little in the way of market demand that is not accommodated. Arguably, if a market is already filled with product variants it is more difficult for competitors to find untapped pockets of market demand.",
		"Human beings like certainty. This liking stems from our ancient ancestors who needed to survive alongside saber‑toothed tigers and poisonous berries. Our brains evolved to help us attend to threats, keep away from them, and remain alive afterward. In fact, we learned that the more certain we were about something, the better chance we had of making the right choice. Is this berry the same shape as last time? The same size? If I know for certain it is, my brain will direct me to eat it because I know it’s safe. And if I’m uncertain, my brain will send out a danger alert to protect me. The dependence on certainty all those millennia ago ensured our survival to the present day, and the danger‑alert system continues to protect us. This is achieved by our brains labeling new, vague, or unpredictable everyday events and experiences as uncertain. Our brains then generate sensations, thoughts, and action plans to keep us safe from the uncertain element, and we live to see another day.",
		"Research psychologists often work with self­report data, made up of participants’ verbal accounts of their behavior. This is the case whenever questionnaires, interviews, or personality inventories are used to measure variables. Self­report methods can be quite useful. They take advantage of the fact that people have a unique opportunity to observe themselves full­-time. However, self­reports can be plagued by several kinds of distortion. One of the most problematic of these distortions is the social desirability bias, which is a tendency to give socially approved answers to questions about oneself. Subjects who are influenced by this bias work overtime trying to create a favorable impression, especially when subjects are asked about sensitive issues. For example, many survey respondents will report that they voted in an election or gave to a charity when in fact it is possible to determine that they did not.",
		"There is little doubt that we are driven by the sell­-by date. Once an item is past that date it goes into the waste stream, further increasing its carbon footprint. Remember those items have already travelled hundreds of miles to reach the shelves and once they go into waste they start a new carbon mile journey. But we all make our own judgement about sell­-by dates; those brought up during the Second World War are often scornful of the terrible waste they believe such caution encourages. The manufacturer of the food has a view when making or growing something that by the time the product reaches the shelves it has already been travelling for so many days and possibly many miles. The manufacturer then decides that a product can reasonably be consumed within say 90 days and 90 days minus so many days for travelling gives the sell­-by date. But whether it becomes toxic is something each individual can decide. It would seem to make sense not to buy large packs of perishable goods but non­perishable items may become cost­-effective.",
		"Lectins are large proteins that serve as a crucial weapon that plants use to defend themselves. The lectins in most plants bind to carbohydrates as we consume the plant. They also bind to sugar molecules found in the gut, in the brain, between nerve endings, in joints and in all bodily fluids. According to Dr. Steven Gundry, these sticky proteins can interrupt messaging between cells and cause toxic and inflammatory reactions. Brain fog is just one result of lectins interrupting communication between nerves. An upset stomach is another common symptom of lectin overload. Dr. Gundry lists a wide range of other health problems including aching joints, dementia, headaches and infertility that have been resolved in his patients once they eliminated lectins from their diets. Dr. Paul Saladino writes that the hypothesis that lectins are involved in Parkinson’s disease is also gaining support, with animal studies showing that ‘lectins, once eaten, may be damaging the gut and travelling to the brain, where they appear to be toxic to dopaminergic neurons’.",
		"For years, many psychologists have held strongly to the belief that the key to addressing negative health habits is to change behavior. This, more than values and attitudes, is the part of personality that is easiest to change. Ingestive habits such as smoking, drinking and various eating behaviors are the most common health concerns targeted for behavioral changes. Process­-addiction behaviors (workaholism, shopaholism, and the like) fall into this category as well. Mental imagery combined with power of suggestion was taken up as the premise of behavioral medicine to help people change negative health behaviors into positive ones. Although this technique alone will not produce changes, when used alongside other behavior modification tactics and coping strategies, behavioral changes have proved effective for some people. What mental imagery does is reinforce a new desired behavior. Repeated use of images reinforces the desired behavior more strongly over time.",
		"I remember one of the smartest I.T. executives for whom I ever worked strongly resisting the movement to measure programmer productivity that was popular at the time. He was fond of saying that the biggest problem with managing computer programmers is that you can never tell whether they are working by looking at them. Picture two programmers working side by side. One is leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his feet on the desk. The other is working hard, typing code into his computer. The one with his feet up could be thinking, and the other one may be too busy typing to give it enough thought. In the end, the busy typist could well produce ten times as many lines of code as the thinker, which contain twice as many new problems as the thinker’s. Unfortunately, most of the productivity measurement schemes I have encountered measure effort or apparent activity. They would reward him and punish his thoughtful neighbor.",
		"In some communities, music and performance have successfully transformed whole neighborhoods as profoundly as The Guggenheim Museum did in Bilbao. In Salvador, Brazil, musician Carlinhos Brown established several music and culture centers in formerly dangerous neighborhoods. In Candeal, where Brown was born, local kids were encouraged to join drum groups, sing, and stage performances. The kids, energized by these activities, began to turn away from dealing drugs. Being a young criminal was no longer their only life option. Being musicians and playing together in a group looked like more fun and was more satisfying. Little by little, the crime rate dropped in those neighborhoods; the hope returned. In another slum area, possibly inspired by Brown’s example, a culture center began to encourage the local kids to stage musical events, some of which dramatized the tragedy that they were still recovering from.",
		"In the twentieth century, advances in technology, from refrigeration to sophisticated ovens to air transportation that carries fresh ingredients around the world, contributed immeasurably to baking and pastry making. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the popularity of fine breads and pastries is growing even faster than new chefs can be trained. Interestingly enough, many of the technological advances in bread making have sparked a reaction among bakers and consumers alike. They are looking to reclaim some of the flavors of old-fashioned breads that were lost as baking became more industrialized and baked goods became more refined, standardized, and―some would say―flavorless. Bakers are researching methods for producing the handmade sourdough breads of the past, and they are experimenting with specialty flours in their search for flavor.",
		"Not many years ago, schoolchildren were taught that carbon dioxide is the naturally occurring lifeblood of plants, just as oxygen is ours. Today, children are more likely to think of carbon dioxide as a poison. That’s because the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased substantially over the past one hundred years, from about 280 parts per million to 380. But what people don’t know is that the carbon dioxide level some 80 million years ago ― back when our mammalian ancestors were evolving ― was at least 1,000 parts per million. In fact, that is the concentration of carbon dioxide you regularly breathe if you work in a new energy­efficient office building, for that is the level established by the engineering group that sets standards for heating and ventilation systems. So not only is carbon dioxide plainly not poisonous, but changes in carbon dioxide levels don’t necessarily mirror human activity. Nor has atmospheric carbon dioxide necessarily been the trigger for global warming historically.",
		"In most wilderness, the majority of groups visiting the area are small―usually between two and four people. But large groups do visit wilderness, and their potential to disturb campsites differs from that of small groups. Although the effect of party size on campsites has never been formally studied, it makes sense that a large group can cause impacts on an undisturbed site more rapidly than a small group. For example, along the New River in West Virginia, the area of vegetation loss on sites used by large commercial rafting companies was more than four times larger than the area on sites used by small groups of fishermen. At well­established campsites, however, a big group need not be a problem, as long as activities are confined within the boundaries of the existing site.",
		"Coming home from work the other day, I saw a woman trying to turn onto the main street and having very little luck because of the constant stream of traffic. I slowed and allowed her to turn in front of me. I was feeling pretty good until, a couple of blocks later, she stopped to let a few more cars into the line, causing us both to miss the next light. I found myself completely irritated with her. How dare she slow me down after I had so graciously let her into the traffic! As I was sitting there stewing, I realized how ridiculous I was being. Suddenly, a phrase I once read came floating into my mind: ‘You must do him or her a kindness for inner reasons, not because someone is keeping score or because you will be punished if you don’t.’ I realized that I had wanted a reward: If I do this nice thing for you, you (or someone else) will do an equally nice thing for me.",
		"An independent artist is probably the one who lives closest to an unbounded creative situation. Many artists have considerable freedom from external requirements about what to do, how to do it, when to do it, and why. At the same time, however, we know that artists usually limit themselves quite forcefully by choice of material and form of expression. To make the choice to express a feeling by carving a specific form from a rock, without the use of high technology or colors, restricts the artist significantly. Such choices are not made to limit creativity, but rather to cultivate it. When everything is possible, creativity has no tension. Creativity is strange in that it finds its way in any kind of situation, no matter how restricted, just as the same amount of water flows faster and stronger through a narrow strait than across the open sea.",
		"It has been proposed that sleep functions to conserve energy. This may be particularly relevant for warm‒blooded animals (mammals and birds) that must expend a lot of energy to maintain a body temperature higher than that of their surroundings. Indeed, many small mammals living in cold climates, who lose heat easily by having an unfavorable surface area to body weight ratio, tend to sleep a lot, often in insulating burrows. Yet sleep does not appear to have evolved only in warm‒blooded animals. Some studies on reptiles and amphibians indicate that they also sleep, and there are now strong indications of a sleep ‒like state in some invertebrates, such as crayfish, fruit flies, and honey bees. Also, though it is true that the overall use of energy is reduced during sleep, as compared with the active waking state, there is almost as much reduction in energy use from just resting quietly. The additional energy conservation in going from the resting state to sleep is minimal.",
		"The Internet and communication technologies play an ever-increasing role in the social lives of young people in developed societies. Adolescents have been quick to immerse themselves in technology with most using the Internet to communicate. Young people treat the mobile phone as an essential necessity of life and often prefer to use text messages to communicate with their friends. Young people also increasingly access social networking websites. As technology and the Internet are a familiar resource for young people, it is logical what they would seek assistance from this source. This has been shown by the increase in websites that provide therapeutic information for young people. A number of ‘youth friendly’ mental health websites have been developed. The information present often takes the form of Frequently Asked Questions, fact sheets and suggested links. It would seem, therefore, logical to provide online counselling for young people.",
		"In professional sports these days, it is not unusual to hear players and coaches talking about process. They talk about focusing on the process and following the process. Rarely do they talk about scoring a goal, a touchdown, a home run, a point, or achieving a good shot. It’s all about process. So, what do they mean by this? What they mean by focusing on the process is that they focus on the actions they need to take in order to achieve their desired result. They don’t focus on the result itself. The reasoning here is that if you follow the steps required, then the result will look after itself. This is one of the big differences between professional and amateur sportspeople. Amateurs often focus on the result and forget about doing all the things that would almost automatically lead to the result.",
		"We all want to believe that our brains sort through information in the most rational way possible. On the contrary, countless studies show that there are many weaknesses of human reasoning. Common weaknesses in reasoning exist across people of all ages and educational backgrounds. For example, confirmation bias is ubiquitous. People pay attention to information that supports their viewpoints, while ignoring evidence to the contrary. Confirmation bias is not the same as being stubborn, and is not constrained to issues about which people have strong opinions. Instead, it acts at a subconscious level to control the way we gather and filter information. Most of us are not aware of these types of flaws in our reasoning processes, but professionals who work to convince us of certain viewpoints study the research on human decision making to determine how to exploit our weaknesses to make us more susceptible to their messages.",
		"If an animal is innately programmed for some type of behaviour, then there are likely to be biological clues. It is no accident that fish have bodies which are streamlined and smooth, with fins and a powerful tail. Their bodies are structurally adapted for moving fast through the water. Similarly, if you found a dead bird or mosquito, you could guess by looking at its wings that flying was its normal mode of transport. However, we must not be over-optimistic. Biological clues are not essential. The extent to which they are found varies from animal to animal and from activity to activity. For example, it is impossible to guess from their bodies that birds make nests, and, sometimes, animals behave in a way quite contrary to what might be expected from their physical form: ghost spiders have tremendously long legs, yet they weave webs out of very short threads. To a human observer, their legs seem a great hindrance as they spin and move about the web.",
		"Humans usually experience sound as the result of vibrations in air or water. Although sound that humans can sense is usually carried through these media, vibrations can also travel through soil, including rocks. Thus, sound can travel through a variety of substances with different densities, and the physical characteristics of the medium through which the sound travels have a major influence on how the sound can be used. For instance, it requires more energy to make water vibrate than to vibrate air, and it requires a great deal of energy to make soil vibrate. Thus, the use of vibrations in communication depends on the ability of the sender to make a substance vibrate. Because of this, large animals such as elephants are more likely than small animals to use vibrations in the soil for communication. In addition, the speed at which sound travels depends on the density of the medium which it is traveling through.",
		"One of the simplest and most effective ways to build empathy in children is to let them play more on their own. Unsupervised kids are not reluctant to tell one another how they feel. In addition, children at play often take on other roles, pretending to be Principal Walsh or Josh’s mom, happily forcing themselves to imagine how someone else thinks and feels. Unfortunately, free play is becoming rare. Boston College research professor Peter Gray has documented a continuous and ultimately dramatic decline in children’s opportunities to play and explore in their own chosen ways over the past fifty years in the United States and other developed countries. The effects have been especially damaging, he argues, to empathy. He concludes that a decline of empathy and a rise in narcissism are exactly what we would expect to see in children who have little opportunity to play socially.",
		"In early modern Europe, transport by water was usually much cheaper than transport by land. An Italian printer calculated in 1550 that to send a load of books from Rome to Lyons would cost 18 scudi by land compared with 4 by sea. Letters were normally carried overland, but a system of transporting letters and newspapers, as well as people, by canal boat developed in the Dutch Republic in the seventeenth century. The average speed of the boats was a little over four miles an hour, slow compared to a rider on horseback. On the other hand, the service was regular, frequent and cheap, and allowed communication not only between Amsterdam and the smaller towns, but also between one small town and another, thus equalizing accessibility to information. It was only in 1837, with the invention of the electric telegraph, that the traditional link between transport and the communication of messages was broken.",
		"Though most bees fill their days visiting flowers and collecting pollen, some bees take advantage of the hard work of others. These thieving bees sneak into the nest of an unsuspecting “normal” bee (known as the host), lay an egg near the pollen mass being gathered by the host bee for her own offspring, and then sneak back out. When the egg of the thief hatches, it kills the host’s offspring and then eats the pollen meant for its victim. Sometimes called brood parasites, these bees are also referred to as cuckoo bees, because they are similar to cuckoo birds, which lay an egg in the nest of another bird and leaves it for that bird to raise. They are more technically called cleptoparasites. Clepto means “thief” in Greek, and the term cleptoparasite refers specifically to an organism that lives off another by stealing its food. In this case the cleptoparasite feeds on the host’s hard-earned pollen stores.",
		"The most dramatic and significant contacts between civilizations were when people from one civilization conquered and eliminated the people of another. These contacts normally were not only violent but brief, and they occurred only occasionally. Beginning in the seventh century A.D., relatively sustained and at times intense intercivilizational contacts did develop between Islam and the West and Islam and India. Most commercial, cultural, and military interactions, however, were within civilizations. While India and China, for instance, were on occasion invaded and subjected by other peoples (Moguls, Mongols), both civilizations have extensive times of “warring states” within their own civilization as well. Similarly, the Greeks fought each other and traded with each other far more often than they did with Persians or other non­Greeks.",
		"The lack of real, direct experience in and with nature has caused many children to regard the natural world as mere abstraction, that fantastic, beautifully filmed place filled with endangered rainforests and polar bears in peril. This overstated, often fictionalized version of nature is no more real―and yet no less real―to them than the everyday nature right outside their doors, waiting to be discovered in a child’s way, at a child’s pace. Consider the University of Cambridge study which found that a group of eight-year-old children was able to identify substantially more characters from animations than common wildlife species. One wonders whether our children’s inherent capacity to recognize, classify, and order information about their environment―abilities once essential to our very survival―is slowly devolving to facilitate life in their increasingly virtualized world. It’s all part of what Robert Pyle first called “the extinction of experience.”",
		"People seeking legal advice should be assured, when discussing their rights or obligations with a lawyer, that the latter will not disclose to third parties the information provided. Only if this duty of confidentiality is respected will people feel free to consult lawyers and provide the information required for the lawyer to prepare the client’s defense. Regardless of the type of information disclosed, clients must be certain that it will not be used against them in a court of law, by the authorities or by any other party. It is generally considered to be a condition of the good functioning of the legal system and, thus, in the general interest. Legal professional privilege is much more than an ordinary rule of evidence, limited in its application to the facts of a particular case. It is a fundamental condition on which the administration of justice as a whole rests.",
		"According to Pierre Pica, understanding quantities approximately in terms of estimating ratios is a universal human intuition. In fact, humans who do not have numbers have no choice but to see the world in this way. By contrast, understanding quantities in terms of exact numbers is not a universal intuition; it is a product of culture. The precedence of approximations and ratios over exact numbers, Pica suggests, is due to the fact that ratios are much more important for survival in the wild than the ability to count. Faced with a group of spear-wielding adversaries, we needed to know instantly whether there were more of them than us. When we saw two trees we needed to know instantly what had more fruit hanging from it. In neither case was it necessary to enumerate every enemy or every fruit individually. The crucial thing was to be able to make quick estimates of the relative amounts.",
		"Humans are so averse to feeling that they’re being cheated that they often respond in ways that seemingly make little sense. Behavioral economists―the economists who actually study what people do as opposed to the kind who simply assume the human mind works like a calculator―have shown again and again that people reject unfair offers even if it costs them money to do so. The typical experiment uses a task called the ultimatum game. It’s pretty straightforward. One person in a pair is given some money―say $10. She then has the opportunity to offer some amount of it to her partner. The partner only has two options. He can take what’s offered or refuse to take anything. There’s no room for negotiation; that’s why it’s called the ultimatum game. What typically happens? Many people offer an equal split to the partner, leaving both individuals happy and willing to trust each other in the future.",
		"When it comes to medical treatment, patients see choice as both a blessing and a burden. And the burden falls primarily on women, who are typically the guardians not only of their own health, but that of their husbands and children. “It is an overwhelming task for women, and consumers in general, to be able to sort through the information they find and make decisions,” says Amy Allina, program director of the National Women’s Health Network. And what makes it overwhelming is not only that the decision is ours, but that the number of sources of information from which we are to make the decisions has exploded. It’s not just a matter of listening to your doctor lay out the options and making a choice. We now have encyclopedic lay­people’s guides to health, “better health” magazines, and the Internet. So now the prospect of medical decisions has become everyone’s worst nightmare of a term paper assignment, with stakes infinitely higher than a grade in a course.",
		"Not all organisms are able to find sufficient food to survive, so starvation is a kind of disvalue often found in nature. It also is part of the process of selection by which biological evolution functions. Starvation helps filter out those less fit to survive, those less resourceful in finding food for themselves and their young. In some circumstances, it may pave the way for genetic variants to take hold in the population of a species and eventually allow the emergence of a new species in place of the old one. Thus starvation is a disvalue that can help make possible the good of greater diversity. Starvation can be of practical or instrumental value, even as it is an intrinsic disvalue. That some organisms must starve in nature is deeply regrettable and sad. The statement remains implacably true, even though starvation also may sometimes subserve ends that are good.",
		"The Internet allows information to flow more freely than ever before. We can communicate and share ideas in unprecedented ways. These developments are revolutionizing our self­expression and enhancing our freedom. But there’s a problem. We’re heading toward a world where an extensive trail of information fragments about us will be forever preserved on the Internet, displayed instantly in a search result. We will be forced to live with a detailed record beginning with childhood that will stay with us for life wherever we go, searchable and accessible from anywhere in the world. This data can often be of dubious reliability; it can be false; or it can be true but deeply humiliating. It may be increasingly difficult to have a fresh start or a second chance. We might find it harder to engage in self­exploration if every false step and foolish act is preserved forever in a permanent record.",
		"Baylor University researchers investigated whether different types of writing could ease people into sleep. To find out, they had 57 young adults spend five minutes before bed writing either a to­do list for the days ahead or a list of tasks they’d finished over the past few days. The results confirm that not all pre­sleep writing is created equally. Those who made to­do lists before bed were able to fall asleep nine minutes faster than those who wrote about past events. The quality of the lists mattered, too; the more tasks and the more specific the to­do lists were, the faster the writers fell asleep. The study authors figure that writing down future tasks unloads the thoughts so you can stop turning them over in your mind. You’re telling your brain that the task will get done ― just not right now.",
		"The present moment feels special. It is real. However much you may remember the past or anticipate the future, you live in the present. Of course, the moment during which you read that sentence is no longer happening. This one is. In other words, it feels as though time flows, in the sense that the present is constantly updating itself. We have a deep intuition that the future is open until it becomes present and that the past is fixed. As time flows, this structure of fixed past, immediate present and open future gets carried forward in time. Yet as natural as this way of thinking is, you will not find it reflected in science. The equations of physics do not tell us which events are occurring right now―they are like a map without the “you are here” symbol. The present moment does not exist in them, and therefore neither does the flow of time.",
		"An interesting aspect of human psychology is that we tend to like things more and find them more appealing if everything about those things is not obvious the first time we experience them. This is certainly true in music. For example, we might hear a song on the radio for the first time that catches our interest and decide we like it. Then the next time we hear it, we hear a lyric we didn’t catch the first time, or we might notice what the piano or drums are doing in the background. A special harmony emerges that we missed before. We hear more and more and understand more and more with each listening. Sometimes, the longer it takes for a work of art to reveal all of its subtleties to us, the more fond of that thing ― whether it’s music, art, dance, or architecture ― we become.",
		"The idea that hypnosis can put the brain into a special state, in which the powers of memory are dramatically greater than normal, reflects a belief in a form of easily unlocked potential. But it is false. People under hypnosis generate more “memories” than they do in a normal state, but these recollections are as likely to be false as true. Hypnosis leads them to come up with more information, but not necessarily more accurate information. In fact, it might actually be people’s beliefs in the power of hypnosis that lead them to recall more things: If people believe that they should have better memory under hypnosis, they will try harder to retrieve more memories when hypnotized. Unfortunately, there’s no way to know whether the memories hypnotized people retrieve are true or not—unless of course we know exactly what the person should be able to remember. But if we knew that, then we’d have no need to use hypnosis in the first place!",
		"To begin with a psychological reason, the knowledge of another’s personal affairs can tempt the possessor of this information to repeat it as gossip because as unrevealed information it remains socially inactive. Only when the information is repeated can its possessor turn the fact that he knows something into something socially valuable like social recognition, prestige, and notoriety. As long as he keeps his information to himself, he may feel superior to those who do not know it. But knowing and not telling does not give him that feeling of “superiority that, so to say, latently contained in the secret, fully actualizes itself only at the moment of disclosure.” This is the main motive for gossiping about well-known figures and superiors. The gossip producer assumes that some of the “fame” of the subject of gossip, as whose “friend” he presents himself, will rub off on him.",
		"The modern adult human brain weighs only 1/50 of the total body weight but uses up to 1/5 of the total energy needs. The brain’s running costs are about eight to ten times as high, per unit mass, as those of the body’s muscles. And around 3/4 of that energy is expended on neurons, the specialized brain cells that communicate in vast networks to generate our thoughts and behaviours. An individual neuron sending a signal in the brain uses as much energy as a leg muscle cell running a marathon. Of course, we use more energy overall when we are running, but we are not always on the move, whereas our brains never switch off. Even though the brain is metabolically greedy, it still outclasses any desktop computer both in terms of the calculations it can perform and the efficiency at which it does this. We may have built computers that can beat our top Grand Master chess players, but we are still far away from designing one that is capable of recognizing and picking up one of the chess pieces as easily as a typical three­-year­-old child can.",
		"When children are young, much of the work is demonstrating to them that they do have control. One wise friend of ours who was a parent educator for twenty years advises giving calendars to preschool­age children and writing down all the important events in their life, in part because it helps children understand the passage of time better, and how their days will unfold. We can’t overstate the importance of the calendar tool in helping kids feel in control of their day. Have them cross off days of the week as you come to them. Spend time going over the schedule for the day, giving them choice in that schedule wherever possible. This communication expresses respect ―they see that they are not just a tagalong to your day and your plans, and they understand what is going to happen, when, and why. As they get older, children will then start to write in important things for themselves, which further helps them develop their sense of control.",
		"People from more individualistic cultural contexts tend to be motivated to maintain self-focused agency or control as these serve as the basis of one’s self-worth. With this form of agency comes the belief that individual successes depend primarily on one’s own abilities and actions, and thus, whether by influencing the environment or trying to accept one’s circumstances, the use of control ultimately centers on the individual. The independent self may be more driven to cope by appealing to a sense of agency or control. However, people from more interdependent cultural contexts tend to be less focused on issues of individual success and agency and more motivated towards group goals and harmony. Research has shown that East Asians prefer to receive, but not seek, more social support rather than seek personal control in certain cases. Therefore, people who hold a more interdependent self-construal may prefer to cope in a way that promotes harmony in relationships.",
		"Metacognition simply means “thinking about thinking,” and it is one of the main distinctions between the human brain and that of other species. Our ability to stand high on a ladder above our normal thinking processes and evaluate why we are thinking as we are thinking is an evolutionary marvel. We have this ability because the most recently developed part of the human brain―the prefrontal cortex― enables self­reflective, abstract thought. We can think about ourselves as if we are not part of ourselves. Research on primate behavior indicates that even our closest cousins, the chimpanzees, lack this ability (although they possess some self­reflective abilities, like being able to identify themselves in a mirror instead of thinking the reflection is another chimp). The ability is a double­edged sword, because while it allows us to evaluate why we are thinking what we are thinking, it also puts us in touch with difficult existential questions that can easily become obsessions.",
		"Competitive activities can be more than just performance showcases where the best is recognized and the rest are overlooked. The provision of timely, constructive feedback to participants on performance is an asset that some competitions and contests offer. In a sense, all competitions give feedback. For many, this is restricted to information about whether the participant is an award-or prizewinner. The provision of that type of feedback can be interpreted as shifting the emphasis to demonstrating superior performance but not necessarily excellence. The best competitions promote excellence, not just winning or “beating” others. The emphasis on superiority is what we typically see as fostering a detrimental effect of competition. Performance feedback requires that the program go beyond the “win, place, or show” level of feedback. Information about performance can be very helpful, not only to the participant who does not win or place but also to those who do.",
		"Mathematical practices and discourses should be situated within cultural contexts, student interests, and real­life situations where all students develop positive identities as mathematics learners. Instruction in mathematics skills in isolation and devoid of student understandings and identities renders them helpless to benefit from explicit instruction. Thus, we agree that explicit instruction benefits students but propose that incorporating culturally relevant pedagogy and consideration of nonacademic factors that promote learning and mastery must enhance explicit instruction in mathematics instruction. Furthermore, teachers play a critical role in developing environments that encourage student identities, agency, and independence through discourses and practices in the classroom. Students who are actively engaged in a contextualized learning process are in control of the learning process and are able to make connections with past learning experiences to foster deeper and more meaningful learning.",
		"The formats and frequencies of traditional trade encompass a spectrum. At the simplest level are the occasional trips made by individual !Kung and Dani to visit their individual trading partners in other bands or villages. Suggestive of our open­-air markets and flea markets were the occasional markets at which Sio villagers living on the coast of northeast New Guinea met New Guineans from inland villages. Up to a few dozen people from each side sat down in rows facing each other. An inlander pushed forward a net bag containing between 10 and 35 pounds of taro and sweet potatoes, and the Sio villager sitting opposite responded by offering a number of pots and coconuts judged equivalent in value to the bag of food. Trobriand Island canoe traders conducted similar markets on the islands that they visited, exchanging utilitarian goods (food, pots, and bowls) by barter, at the same time as they and their individual trade partners gave each other reciprocated gifts of luxury items (shell necklaces and armbands).",
		"The world’s first complex writing form, Sumerian cuneiform, followed an evolutionary path, moving around 3500 BCE from pictographic to ideographic representations, from the depiction of objects to that of abstract notions. Sumerian cuneiform was a linear writing system, its symbols usually set in columns, read from top to bottom and from left to right. This regimentation was a form of abstraction: the world is not a linear place, and objects do not organize themselves horizontally or vertically in real life. Early rock paintings, thought to have been created for ritual purposes, were possibly shaped and organized to follow the walls of the cave, or the desires of the painters, who may have organized them symbolically, or artistically, or even randomly. Yet after cuneiform, virtually every form of script that has emerged has been set out in rows with a clear beginning and endpoint. So uniform is this expectation, indeed, that the odd exception is noteworthy, and generally established for a specific purpose.",
		"Most historians of science point to the need for a reliable calendar to regulate agricultural activity as the motivation for learning about what we now call astronomy, the study of stars and planets. Early astronomy provided information about when to plant crops and gave humans their first formal method of recording the passage of time. Stonehenge, the 4,000-year-old ring of stones in southern Britain, is perhaps the best-known monument to the discovery of regularity and predictability in the world we inhabit. The great markers of Stonehenge point to the spots on the horizon where the sun rises at the solstices and equinoxes―the dates we still use to mark the beginnings of the seasons. The stones may even have been used to predict eclipses. The existence of Stonehenge, built by people without writing, bears silent testimony both to the regularity of nature and to the ability of the human mind to see behind immediate appearances and discover deeper meanings in events.",
		"The idea that people selectively expose themselves to news content has been around for a long time, but it is even more important today with the fragmentation of audiences and the proliferation of choices. Selective exposure is a psychological concept that says people seek out information that conforms to their existing belief systems and avoid information that challenges those beliefs. In the past when there were few sources of news, people could either expose themselves to mainstream news—where they would likely see beliefs expressed counter to their own—or they could avoid news altogether. Now with so many types of news constantly available to a full range of niche audiences, people can easily find a source of news that consistently confirms their own personal set of beliefs. This leads to the possibility of creating many different small groups of people with each strongly believing they are correct and everyone else is wrong about how the world works.",
		"Accepting whatever others are communicating only pays off if their interests correspond to ours―think cells in a body, bees in a beehive. As far as communication between humans is concerned, such commonality of interests is rarely achieved; even a pregnant mother has reasons to mistrust the chemical signals sent by her fetus. Fortunately, there are ways of making communication work even in the most adversarial of relationships. A prey can convince a predator not to chase it. But for such communication to occur, there must be strong guarantees that those who receive the signal will be better off believing it. The messages have to be kept, on the whole, honest. In the case of humans, honesty is maintained by a set of cognitive mechanisms that evaluate communicated information. These mechanisms allow us to accept most beneficial messages―to be open―while rejecting most harmful messages―to be vigilant.",
		"According to its dictionary definition, an anthem is both a song of loyalty, often to a country, and a piece of ‘sacred music’, definitions that are both applicable in sporting contexts. This genre is dominated, although not exclusively, by football and has produced a number of examples where popular songs become synonymous with the club and are enthusiastically adopted by the fans. More than this they are often spontaneous expressions of loyalty and identity and, according to Desmond Morris, have ‘reached the level of something approaching a local art form’. A strong element of the appeal of such sports songs is that they feature ‘memorable and easily sung choruses in which fans can participate’. This is a vital part of the team’s performance as it makes the fans’ presence more tangible. This form of popular culture can be said to display pleasure and emotional excess in contrast to the dominant culture which tends to maintain ‘respectable aesthetic distance and control’.",
		"We don’t know what ancient Greek music sounded like, because there are no examples of it in written or notated form, nor has it survived in oral tradition. Much of it was probably improvised anyway, within certain rules and conventions. So we are forced largely to guess at its basis from the accounts of writers such as Plato and Aristotle, who were generally more concerned with writing about music as a philosophical and ethical exercise than with providing a technical primer on its practice. It seems Greek music was predominantly a vocal form, consisting of sung verse accompanied by instruments such as the lyre or the plucked kithara (the root of ‘guitar’). In fact, Plato considered music in which the lyre and flute played alone and not as the accompaniment of dance or song to be ‘exceedingly coarse and tasteless’. The melodies seem to have had a very limited pitch range, since the instruments generally span only an octave, from one E (as we’d now define it) to the next.",
		"The actual problems with monopolies are caused by statism, not capitalism. Under a statist social system, taxes, subsidies, tariffs, and regulations often serve to protect existing large players in the marketplace. Those players often use crony tactics to retain or expand the protections: a new tariff preventing foreign competition, a subsidy making it harder for new players to compete with them, or a regulatory measure that a large company has the resources to comply with. Under a capitalist social system, on the other hand, the government has no say in how dominant a company may become in its industry or how companies take over and merge with one another. Furthermore, a capitalist society doesn’t have rights-violating taxes, tariffs, subsidies, or regulations favoring anybody nor does it have antitrust laws. Under capitalism, dominance can only be achieved by becoming really good at what you’re doing. And to maintain dominance, you have to continue to stay ahead of the competition, which sees your dominance and profits as a sign that there is money to be made by others as well.",
		"Ecosystems differ in composition and extent. They can be defined as ranging from the communities and interactions of organisms in your mouth or those in the canopy of a rain forest to all those in Earth’s oceans. The processes governing them differ in complexity and speed. There are systems that turn over in minutes, and there are others whose rhythmic time extends to hundreds of years. Some ecosystems are extensive (‘biomes’, such as the African savanna); some cover regions (river basins); many involve clusters of villages (micro-watersheds); others are confined to the level of a single village (the village pond). In each example there is an element of indivisibility. Divide an ecosystem into parts by creating barriers, and the sum of the productivity of the parts will typically be found to be lower than the productivity of the whole, other things being equal. The mobility of biological populations is a reason. Safe passages, for example, enable migratory species to survive.",
		"The spider chart, also called a radar chart, is a form of line graph. It helps the researcher to represent their data in a chart that shows the relative size of a response on one scale for interrelated variables. Like the bar chart, the data needs to have one scale which is common to all variables. The spider chart is drawn with the variables spanning the chart, creating a spider web. An example of this is seen in a research study looking at self­-reported confidence in year 7 students across a range of subjects taught in their first term in secondary school. The researcher takes the responses from a sample group and calculates the mean to plot on the spider chart. The spider chart allows the researcher to easily compare and contrast the confidence level in different subjects for the sample group. The chart, like the pie chart, can then be broken down for different groups of students within the study to elicit further analysis of findings.",
		"Recognizing ethical issues is the most important step in understanding business ethics. An ethical issue is an identifiable problem, situation, or opportunity that requires a person to choose from among several actions that may be evaluated as right or wrong, ethical or unethical. Learning how to choose from alternatives and make a decision requires not only good personal values, but also knowledge competence in the business area of concern. Employees also need to know when to rely on their organizations’ policies and codes of ethics or have discussions with co-workers or managers on appropriate conduct. Ethical decision making is not always easy because there are always gray areas that create dilemmas, no matter how decisions are made. For instance, should an employee report on a co-worker engaging in time theft? Should a salesperson leave out facts about a product’s poor safety record in his presentation to a customer? Such questions require the decision maker to evaluate the ethics of his or her choice and decide whether to ask for guidance.",
		"The idea that leaders inherently possess certain physical, intellectual, or personality traits that distinguish them from nonleaders was the foundational belief of the trait‑based approach to leadership. This approach dominated leadership research from the late 1800s until the mid‑1940s and has experienced a resurgence of interest in the last couple of decades. Early trait theorists believed that some individuals are born with the traits that allow them to become great leaders. Thus, early research in this area often presented the widely stated argument that “leaders are born, not made.” Also, some of the earliest leadership studies were grounded in what was referred to as the “great man” theory because researchers at the time focused on identifying traits of highly visible leaders in history who were typically male and associated with the aristocracy or political or military leadership. In more recent history, numerous authors have acknowledged that there are many enduring qualities, whether innate or learned, that contribute to leadership potential. These traits include such things as drive, self-confidence, cognitive ability, conscientiousness, determination, intelligence, and integrity.",
		"From the 8th to the 12th century CE, while Europe suffered the perhaps overdramatically named Dark Ages, science on planet Earth could be found almost exclusively in the Islamic world. This science was not exactly like our science today, but it was surely antecedent to it and was nonetheless an activity aimed at knowing about the world. Muslim rulers granted scientific institutions tremendous resources, such as libraries, observatories, and hospitals. Great schools in all the cities covering the Arabic Near East and Northern Africa (and even into Spain) trained generations of scholars. Almost every word in the modern scientific lexicon that begins with the prefix “al” owes its origins to Islamic science—algorithm, alchemy, alcohol, alkali, algebra. And then, just over 400 years after it started, it ground to an apparent halt, and it would be a few hundred years, give or take, before what we would today unmistakably recognize as science appeared in Europe—with Galileo, Kepler, and, a bit later, Newton.",
		"Providing feedback to students is a critical task of teachers. General psychology has shown that knowledge of results is necessary for improving a skill. Advanced musicians are able to self-critique their performances, but developing music students rely on teachers to supply evaluative feedback. The most constructive feedback is that which expresses the discrepancies between a student’s performance of a piece of music and an optimal version. Expert teachers give more detailed feedback than general appraisals, and music educators generally recognize that more specific teacher feedback facilitates student performance improvement. Researchers also have explored whether the feedback of effective teachers is more often positively or negatively expressed, that is, constituting praise or criticism. One might intuitively think that positive comments are more motivating to students and, as a result, are more associated with effective teaching. The research, however, paints a slightly different picture. Although positive feedback is likely more helpful with younger learners and in one-on-one instruction, more advanced music students seem to accept and benefit from greater levels of criticism in lessons.",
		"Consider The Wizard of Oz as a psychological study of motivation. Dorothy and her three friends work hard to get to the Emerald City, overcoming barriers, persisting against all adversaries. They do so because they expect the Wizard to give them what they are missing. Instead, the wonderful (and wise) Wizard makes them aware that they, not he, always had the power to fulfill their wishes. For Dorothy, home is not a place but a feeling of security, of comfort with people she loves; it is wherever her heart is. The courage the Lion wants, the intelligence the Scarecrow longs for, and the emotions the Tin Man dreams of are attributes they already possess. They need to think about these attributes not as internal conditions but as positive ways in which they are already relating to others. After all, didn’t they demonstrate those qualities on the journey to Oz, a journey motivated by little more than an expectation, an idea about the future likelihood of getting something they wanted?",
		"The intelligence of monkeys pales in comparison with that of our closest relatives, the great apes: orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos, whose brains are twice as large relative to their body weight. Most primatologists believe the apes acquired their larger brains to help them communicate with and manipulate their peers. And they certainly do exhibit complex social interactions within their group; they seem capable of feeling empathy, have a self­image, and exhibit a degree of consciousness as they can recognize themselves in a mirror. But this “social hypothesis” does not explain why it was the great apes that became so clever, rather than monkeys or a group of terrestrial mammals. Nor does it explain why orangutans, who seldom encounter their neighbors, are so intelligent. It seems likely that some other factor must have been in play that caused apes to become more intelligent in the first place, and which could subsequently have enabled some members of the group to develop high­level sociality.",
		"Viewing the stress response as a resource can transform the physiology of fear into the biology of courage. It can turn a threat into a challenge and can help you do your best under pressure. Even when the stress doesn’t feel helpful―as in the case of anxiety―welcoming it can transform it into something that is helpful: more energy, more confidence, and a greater willingness to take action. You can apply this strategy in your own life anytime you notice signs of stress. When you feel your heart beating or your breath quickening, realize that it is your body’s way of trying to give you more energy. If you notice tension in your body, remind yourself that the stress response gives you access to your strength. Sweaty palms? Remember what it felt like to go on your first date―palms sweat when you’re close to something you want.",
		"Dr. Joseph Bell was a professor of medicine at the University of Edinburgh. His students were amazed by his astonishing powers of observation. He seemed able to determine what patients did for a living, or what illness they might have, simply by glancing in their direction. One time he concluded that a patient had walked across a golf course on the way to the doctor, simply by looking at his shoes. One of Bell’s students was particularly impressed with his teacher’s abilities. He filled up notebooks with examples of what he called Bell’s “eerie trick of spotting details.” The student eventually went into practice himself outside London. When business was slow he filled his spare moments by writing stories. He took Dr. Bell’s powers of perception, and gave them to a character of his own making— a character who made the young doctor, Arthur Conan Doyle, famous around the world. And so the professor who made even the most complex diagnosis seem “elementary” became the inspiration for fiction’s greatest detective, Sherlock Holmes.",
		"The process of crossing cultures challenges the very basis of who we are as cultural beings. It offers opportunities for new learning and growth. Being “uprooted” from our home brings us understanding not only of the people and their culture in our new environment, but of ourselves and our home culture. Although the difficulties that can arise from crossing cultures are often shocking, success stories are everywhere. Despite, or rather because of, the suffering and ambivalence we undergo when we cross cultures, we gradually find ourselves uniquely privileged to define ourselves and others anew with clarity and insight that we could not have cultivated without leaving home. Adapting to a new and unfamiliar culture, then, is more than survival. It is a life­-changing journey. It is a process of “becoming”— personal reinvention, transformation, growth, reaching out beyond the boundaries of our own existence. The process does not require that we abandon our former personalities and the cultures into which we were born. Rather, it compels us to find ourselves as if for the first time, particularly those “cultural invariants” within us—aspects that we hold dear and refuse to compromise.",
		"During the early stages when the aquaculture industry was rapidly expanding, mistakes were made and these were costly both in terms of direct losses and in respect of the industry’s image. High-density rearing led to outbreaks of infectious diseases that in some cases devastated not just the caged fish, but local wild fish populations too. The negative impact on local wildlife inhabiting areas close to the fish farms continues to be an ongoing public relations problem for the industry. Furthermore, a general lack of knowledge and insufficient care being taken when fish pens were initially constructed meant that pollution from excess feed and fish waste created huge barren underwater deserts. These were costly lessons to learn, but now stricter regulations are in place to ensure that fish pens are placed in sites where there is good water flow to remove fish waste. This, in addition to other methods that decrease the overall amount of uneaten food, has helped aquaculture to clean up its act.",
		"The Greeks’ focus on the salient object and its attributes led to their failure to understand the fundamental nature of causality. Aristotle explained that a stone falling through the air is due to the stone having the property of “gravity.” But of course a piece of wood tossed into water floats instead of sinking. This phenomenon Aristotle explained as being due to the wood having the property of “levity”! In both cases the focus is exclusively on the object, with no attention paid to the possibility that some force outside the object might be relevant. But the Chinese saw the world as consisting of continuously interacting substances, so their attempts to understand it caused them to be oriented toward the complexities of the entire “field,” that is, the context or environment as a whole. The notion that events always occur in a field of forces would have been completely intuitive to the Chinese.",
		"When people face real adversity─disease, unemployment, or the disabilities of age─affection from a pet takes on new meaning. A pet’s continuing affection becomes crucially important for those enduring hardship because it reassures them that their core essence has not been damaged. Thus pets are important in the treatment of depressed or chronically ill patients. In addition, pets are used to great advantage with the institutionalized aged. In such institutions it is difficult for the staff to retain optimism when all the patients are declining in health. Children who visit cannot help but remember what their parents or grandparents once were and be depressed by their incapacities. Animals, however, have no expectations about mental capacity. They do not worship youth. They have no memories about what the aged once were and greet them as if they were children. An old man holding a puppy can relive a childhood moment with complete accuracy. His joy and the animal’s response are the same.",
		"Psychologists who study giving behavior have noticed that some people give substantial amounts to one or two charities, while others give small amounts to many charities. Those who donate to one or two charities seek evidence about what the charity is doing and whether it is really having a positive impact. If the evidence indicates that the charity is really helping others, they make a substantial donation. Those who give small amounts to many charities are not so interested in whether what they are doing helps others─ psychologists call them warm glow givers. Knowing that they are giving makes them feel good, regardless of the impact of their donation. In many cases the donation is so small─ $10 or less─that if they stopped to think, they would realize that the cost of processing the donation is likely to exceed any benefit it brings to the charity.",
		"“Monumental” is a word that comes very close to expressing the basic characteristic of Egyptian art. Never before and never since has the quality of monumentality been achieved as fully as it was done in Egypt. The reason for this is not the external size and massiveness of their works, although the Egyptians admittedly achieved some amazing things in this respect. Many modern structures exceed those of Egypt in terms of purely physical size. But massiveness has nothing to do with monumentality. An Egyptian sculpture no bigger than a person’s hand is more monumental than that gigantic pile of stones that constitutes the war memorial in Leipzig, for instance. Monumentality is not a matter of external weight, but of “inner weight.” This inner weight is the quality which Egyptian art possesses to such a degree that everything in it seems to be made of primeval stone, like a mountain range, even if it is only a few inches across or carved in wood.",
		"Speculations about the meaning and purpose of prehistoric art rely heavily on analogies drawn with modern-day hunter-gatherer societies. Such primitive societies, as Steven Mithen emphasizes in The Prehistory of the Modern Mind, tend to view man and beast, animal and plant, organic and inorganic spheres, as participants in an integrated, animated totality. The dual expressions of this tendency are anthropomorphism (the practice of regarding animals as humans) and totemism (the practice of regarding humans as animals), both of which spread through the visual art and the mythology of primitive cultures. Thus the natural world is conceptualized in terms of human social relations. When considered in this light, the visual preoccupation of early humans with the nonhuman creatures inhabiting their world becomes profoundly meaningful. Among hunter-gatherers, animals are not only good to eat, they are also good to think about, as Claude Lévi-Strauss has observed. In the practice of totemism, he has suggested, an unlettered humanity “broods upon itself and its place in nature.”",
		"Regulations covering scientific experiments on human subjects are strict. Subjects must give their informed, written consent, and experimenters must submit their proposed experiments to thorough examination by overseeing bodies. Scientists who experiment on themselves can, functionally if not legally, avoid the restrictions associated with experimenting on other people. They can also sidestep most of the ethical issues involved: nobody, presumably, is more aware of an experiment’s potential hazards than the scientist who devised it. Nonetheless, experimenting on oneself remains deeply problematic. One obvious drawback is the danger involved; knowing that it exists does nothing to reduce it. A less obvious drawback is the limited range of data that the experiment can generate. Human anatomy and physiology vary, in small but significant ways, according to gender, age, lifestyle, and other factors. Experimental results derived from a single subject are, therefore, of limited value; there is no way to know that the subject’s responses are typical or atypical of the response of humans as a group.",
		"Like whole individuals, cells have a life span. During their life cycle (cell cycle), cell size, shape, and metabolic activities can change dramatically. A cell is “born” as a twin when its mother cell divides, producing two daughter cells. Each daughter cell is smaller than the mother cell, and except for unusual cases, each grows until it becomes as large as the mother cell was. During this time, the cell absorbs water, sugars, amino acids, and other nutrients and assembles them into new, living protoplasm. After the cell has grown to the proper size, its metabolism shifts as it either prepares to divide or matures and differentiates into a specialized cell. Both growth and development require a complex and dynamic set of interactions involving all cell parts. That cell metabolism and structure should be complex would not be surprising, but actually, they are rather simple and logical. Even the most complex cell has only a small number of parts, each responsible for a distinct, well-defined aspect of cell life.",
		"Trends constantly suggest new opportunities for individuals to restage themselves, representing occasions for change. To understand how trends can ultimately give individuals power and freedom, one must first discuss fashion’s importance as a basis for change. The most common explanation offered by my informants as to why fashion is so appealing is that it constitutes a kind of theatrical costumery. Clothes are part of how people present themselves to the world, and fashion locates them in the present, relative to what is happening in society and to fashion’s own history. As a form of expression, fashion contains a host of ambiguities, enabling individuals to recreate the meanings associated with specific pieces of clothing. Fashion is among the simplest and cheapest methods of self-expression: clothes can be inexpensively purchased while making it easy to convey notions of wealth, intellectual stature, relaxation or environmental consciousness, even if none of these is true. Fashion can also strengthen agency in various ways, opening up space for action.",
		"A number of studies provide substantial evidence of an innate human disposition to respond differentially to social stimuli. From birth, infants will orient preferentially towards the human face and voice, seeming to know that such stimuli are particularly meaningful for them. Moreover, they register this connection actively, imitating a variety of facial gestures that are presented to them―tongue protrusions, lip tightenings, mouth openings. They will even try to match gestures with which they have some difficulty, experimenting with their own faces until they succeed. When they do succeed, they show pleasure by a brightening of their eyes; when they fail, they show distress. In other words, they not only have an innate capacity for matching their own kinaesthetically experienced bodily movements with those of others that are visually perceived; they have an innate drive to do so. That is, they seem to have an innate drive to imitate others whom they judge to be ‘like me’.",
		"While the eye sees at the surface, the ear tends to penetrate below the surface. Joachim-Ernst Berendt points out that the ear is the only sense that fuses an ability to measure with an ability to judge. We can discern different colors, but we can give a precise number to different sounds. Our eyes do not let us perceive with this kind of precision. An unmusical person can recognize an octave and, perhaps once instructed, a quality of tone, that is, a C or an F-sharp. Berendt points out that there are few ‘acoustical illusions’―something sounding like something that in fact it is not―while there are many optical illusions. The ears do not lie. The sense of hearing gives us a remarkable connection with the invisible, underlying order of things. Through our ears we gain access to vibration, which underlies everything around us. The sense of tone and music in another’s voice gives us an enormous amount of information about that person, about her stance toward life, about her intentions.",
		"I had the habit of telling my sons what they wanted to hear in the moment and making a promise in order to avoid a fight. Then, when I said something different and broke the promise, there was a much bigger battle. They lost trust in me. Now I make efforts to correct this habit. Even if it’s not what they want to hear, I try to be honest and say it anyway. I know that is a sure way to decrease conflict between us. As I am honest with them, our trust builds.",
		"Pests and diseases are part of nature. In the ideal system there is a natural balance between predators and pests. If the system is imbalanced, one population can increase because it is not being preyed upon by another. The aim of natural control is not to eradicate pests and diseases. It is to restore a natural balance between pest and predator and keep pests and diseases down to an acceptable level. However, pesticides, another option to natural pest and disease control, do not solve the pest problem. In the past 50 years, pesticide use has increased ten times while crop losses from pest damage have doubled. Here lies the reason why natural control is chosen more than pesticide use.",
		"It’s no surprise that labels are becoming the “go to” place when people have questions about how food is produced. But new Cornell University research finds that consumers crave more information, especially for the potentially harmful ingredients that aren’t included in the product. The laboratory study of 351 shoppers found consumers willing to pay a premium when a product label says “free of” something, but only if the package provides “negative” information on whatever the product is “free of.” For example, a food labeled “free” of a food dye will compel some consumers to buy that product. But even more people will buy that product if that same label includes information about the risks of ingesting such dyes. “When they get more information about ingredients, consumers are more confident about their decisions and value the product more,” Harry M. Kaiser, a Cornell professor, said.",
		"The laser pointer, which became popular in the 1990s, was at first typically thick to hold in the hand. Before long, such pointers came in slimmer pocket models and became easier to handle. Still, the laser pointer had its own weaknesses. Batteries were required and had to be replaced, and the shaky hand movements of a nervous lecturer were shown in the sudden motion of the glowing red dot. Moreover, the red dot could be difficult to see against certain backgrounds, thus making the laser pointer inferior even to a simple stick. To correct this problem, more advanced and thus more expensive green­beam laser pointers came to be introduced.",
		"In Ontario, there is an old-growth forest near Temagami. Some people want to cut down the trees for lumber. Others want to keep it as it is: they believe it is unique and must be protected for coming generations. Many people are somewhere in the middle, wanting some use and some protection. Most people are in favor of using our resources wisely. They prefer practices that make our resources sustainable. That is, we should use our resources wisely now and we will still have more for the future. We are all responsible for looking after the environment. We can learn from First Nations’ people who have long known the importance of preserving the environment for future generations. What you inherited and live with will become the inheritance of future generations.",
		"Some species use alarm calls to share information about potential predators. Their alarm calls seem to convey very specific information about the nature of the predator that has been detected as they become more mature. When a young vervet monkey spots a bird in the sky above it, it will give an alarm call. In this case a sort of “cough­cough” noise. At this stage, the call appears to be an innate possible­danger­above signal because it is given as a response to any large flying object, dangerous or otherwise. But as the monkey matures, the range of stimuli that will trigger the call narrows. Eventually the use of this alarm call will be restricted to those situations when an eagle is spotted in the skies above. Upon hearing the call the members of the group will scan the sky to locate the threat and then make a dash for the cover provided by dense vegetation.",
		"Suppose we wish to create a yellow by mixing red and green paints. If we mixed the paints together, we would fail in getting the intended result, probably getting a reddish color instead. This is because the paints were mixed together so that their effects on light interfered with each other. But suppose the red were painted as many small dots of paint. From a distance, it would look like a solid red. Similarly, the green could be painted as many small dots on the same paper, never overlapping the red dots. From up close the many small red and green dots would be seen. From a distance, far enough back so that the individual dots could be invisible , the eye would receive a mixture of red and green light. The light would look yellow.",
		"In most people, emotions are situational. Something in the here and now makes you mad. The emotion itself is tied to the situation in which it originates. As long as you remain in that emotional situation, you’re likely to stay angry. If you leave the situation, the opposite is true. The emotion begins to disappear as soon as you move away from the situation. Moving away from the situation prevents it from taking hold of you. Counselors often advise clients to get some emotional distance from whatever is bothering them. One easy way to do that is to geographically separate yourself from the source of your anger.",
		"How soon is too soon to start kids on a computer? If your baby is less than a year old, the answer is clear. That is because a baby’s vision has not developed enough to focus on the screen, and they can’t even sit up on their own. But after their first birthday, people have different answers to the question. Some people disagree with the idea of exposing three­year­olds to computers. They insist that parents stimulate their children in the traditional ways through reading, sports, and play―instead of computers. Others argue that early exposure to computers is helpful in adapting to our digital world. They believe the earlier kids start to use computers, the more familiarity they will have when using other digital devices.",
		"When we don’t want to believe a certain claim, we ask ourselves, “Must I believe it?” Then we search for contrary evidence, and if we find a single reason to doubt the claim, we can dismiss the claim. Psychologists now have numerous findings on “motivated reasoning,” showing the many tricks people use to reach the conclusions they want to reach. When subjects are told that an intelligence test gave them a low score, they choose to read articles criticizing the validity of IQ tests. When people read a (fictitious) scientific study reporting heavy caffeine consumption is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, women who are heavy coffee drinkers find more errors in the study than do less caffeinated women.",
		"Feeling and emotion are crucial for everyday decision making. The neuroscientist Antonio Damasio studied people who were perfectly normal in every way except for brain injuries that damaged their emotional systems. As a result, they were unable to make decisions or function effectively in the world. While they could describe exactly how they should have been functioning, they couldn’t determine where to live, what to eat, and what products to buy and use. This finding contradicts the common belief that decision making is the heart of rational, logical thought. But modern research shows that the affective system provides critical assistance to your decision making by helping you make rapid selections between good and bad, reducing the number of things to be considered.",
		"New technologies create new interactions and cultural rules. As a way to encourage TV viewing, social television systems now enable social interaction among TV viewers in different locations. These systems are known to build a greater sense of connectedness among TV­using friends. One field study focused on how five friends between the ages of 30-36 communicated while watching TV at their homes. The technology allowed them to see which of the friends were watching TV and what they were watching. They chose how to communicate via social television—whether through voice chat or text chat. The study showed a strong preference for text over voice. Users offered two key reasons for favoring text chat. First, text chat required less effort and attention, and was more enjoyable than voice chat. Second, study participants viewed text chat as more polite.",
		"Many successful people tend to keep a good bedtime routine. They take the time just before bed to reflect on or write down three things that they are thankful for that happened during the day. Keeping a diary of things that they appreciate reminds them of the progress they made that day in any aspect of their lives. It serves as a key way to stay motivated, especially when they experience a hardship. In such case, many people fall easily into the trap of replaying negative situations from a hard day. But regardless of how badly their day went, successful people typically avoid that trap of negative self-talk. That is because they know it will only create more stress.",
		"From the beginning of human history, people have asked questions about the world and their place within it. For early societies, the answers to the most basic questions were found in religion. Some people, however, found the traditional religious explanations inadequate, and they began to search for answers based on reason. This shift marked the birth of philosophy, and the first of the great thinkers that we know of was Thales of Miletus. He used reason to inquire into the nature of the universe, and encouraged others to do likewise. He passed on to his followers not only his answers but also the process of thinking rationally, together with an idea of what kind of explanations could be considered satisfactory.",
		"Everyone knows a young person who is impressively “street smart” but does poorly in school. We think it is a waste that one who is so intelligent about so many things in life seems unable to apply that intelligence to academic work. What we don’t realize is that schools and colleges might be at fault for missing the opportunity to draw such street smarts and guide them toward good academic work. Nor do we consider one of the major reasons why schools and colleges overlook the intellectual potential of street smarts: the fact that we associate those street smarts with anti-intellectual concerns. We associate the educated life, the life of the mind, too narrowly with subjects and texts that we consider inherently weighty and academic.",
		"People have higher expectations as their lives get better. However, the higher the expectations, the more difficult it is to be satisfied. We can increase the satisfaction we feel in our lives by controlling our expectations. Adequate expectations leave room for many experiences to be pleasant surprises. The challenge is to find a way to have proper expectations. One way to do this is by keeping wonderful experiences rare. No matter what you can afford, save great wine for special occasions. Make an elegantly styled silk blouse a special treat. This may seem like an act of denying your desires, but I don’t think it is. On the contrary, it’s a way to make sure that you can continue to experience familiarity. What’s the point of great wines and great blouses if they don’t make you feel great?",
		"We notice repetition among confusion, and the opposite: we notice a break in a repetitive pattern. But how do these arrangements make us feel? And what about “perfect” regularity and “perfect” chaos? Some repetition gives us a sense of security, in that we know what is coming next. We like some predictability. We arrange our lives in largely repetitive schedules. Randomness, in organization or in events, is more challenging and more frightening for most of us. With “perfect” chaos we are frustrated by having to adapt and react again and again. But “perfect” regularity is perhaps even more horrifying in its monotony than randomness is. It implies a cold, unfeeling, mechanical quality. Such perfect order does not exist in nature; there are too many forces working against each other. Either extreme, therefore, feels threatening.",
		"How does a leader make people feel important? First, by listening to them. Let them know you respect their thinking, and let them voice their opinions. As an added bonus, you might learn something! A friend of mine once told me about the CEO of a large company who told one of his managers, “There’s nothing you could possibly tell me that I haven’t already thought about before. Don’t ever tell me what you think unless I ask you. Is that understood?” Imagine the loss of self­esteem that manager must have felt. It must have discouraged him and negatively affected his performance. On the other hand, when you make a person feel a great sense of importance, he or she will feel on top of the world—and the level of energy will increase rapidly.",
		"School assignments have typically required that students work alone. This emphasis on individual productivity reflected an opinion that independence is a necessary factor for success. Having the ability to take care of oneself without depending on others was considered a requirement for everyone. Consequently, teachers in the past less often arranged group work or encouraged students to acquire teamwork skills. However, since the new millennium, businesses have experienced more global competition that requires improved productivity. This situation has led employers to insist that newcomers to the labor market provide evidence of traditional independence but also interdependence shown through teamwork skills. The challenge for educators is to ensure individual competence in basic skills while adding learning opportunities that can enable students to also perform well in teams.",
		"Intellectual humility is admitting you are human and there are limits to the knowledge you have. It involves recognizing that you possess cognitive and personal biases, and that your brain tends to see things in such a way that your opinions and viewpoints are favored above others. It is being willing to work to overcome those biases in order to be more objective and make informed decisions. People who display intellectual humility are more likely to be receptive to learning from others who think differently than they do. They tend to be well-liked and respected by others because they make it clear that they value what other people bring to the table. Intellectually humble people want to learn more and are open to finding information from a variety of sources. They are not interested in trying to appear or feel superior to others.",
		"Social connections are so essential for our survival and well­being that we not only cooperate with others to build relationships, we also compete with others for friends. And often we do both at the same time. Take gossip. Through gossip, we bond with our friends, sharing interesting details. But at the same time, we are creating potential enemies in the targets of our gossip. Or consider rival holiday parties where people compete to see who will attend their party. We can even see this tension in social media as people compete for the most friends and followers. At the same time, competitive exclusion can also generate cooperation. High school social clubs and country clubs use this formula to great effect: It is through selective inclusion and exclusion that they produce loyalty and lasting social bonds.",
		"Recent research suggests that evolving humans’ relationship with dogs changed the structure of both species’ brains. One of the various physical changes caused by domestication is a reduction in the size of the brain: 16 percent for horses, 34 percent for pigs, and 10 to 30 percent for dogs. This is because once humans started to take care of these animals, they no longer needed various brain functions in order to survive. Animals who were fed and protected by humans did not need many of the skills required by their wild ancestors and lost the parts of the brain related to those capacities. A similar process occurred for humans, who seem to have been domesticated by wolves. About 10,000 years ago, when the role of dogs was firmly established in most human societies, the human brain also shrank by about",
		"It was once considered an amazing achievement to reach the summit of Mount Everest. It was even a national honor to have a climber waving a national flag there. But now that almost 4,000 people have reached its summit, the achievement means less than it did a half century ago. In 1963, six people reached the top, but in the spring of 2012, the summit was crowded with more than 500 people. Then what makes it possible for so many people to reach the summit? One important factor is improved weather forecasting. In the past, lack of information led expeditions to attempt the summit whenever their team members were ready. Today, with hyper­accurate satellite forecasts, all teams know exactly when the weather will be perfect for climbing, and they often go for the top on the same days.",
		"While women work long hours every day at home, since this work does not produce a wage, this is often ignored in considering the respective contributions of women and men in the family’s joint prosperity. When, however, a woman works outside the home and earns a wage, she contributes to the family’s prosperity more visibly. The woman also has more voice, because of being less dependent on of others. The higher status of women even affects ideas on the female child’s ‘due.’ So the freedom to seek and hold outside jobs can contribute to the reduction of women’s relative and absolute difficulties. Freedom in one area (that of being able to work outside the household) seems to help to foster freedom in others (in enhancing freedom from hunger, illness, and relative difficulties).",
		"Even before we were born, we were compared with others. Through the latest medical technology parents may begin comparing their children with other babies before birth. For the rest of our lives, we are compared with others, and rather than celebrating our uniqueness, comparisons usually point up who is stronger, brighter, or more beautiful. Comparisons such as “He has more money than I have” or “She looks better than I look” are likely to deflate our self-worth. Rather than finding others who seemingly are better off, focus on the unique attributes that make you who you are. Avoid judging your own value by comparing yourself with others. A healthy, positive self-concept is fueled not by judgments of others, but by a genuine sense of worth that you recognize in yourself.",
		"Most of us play it safe by putting our needs aside when faced with the possibility of feeling guilty or disappointing others. At work you may allow a complaining coworker to keep stealing your energy to avoid conflict― ending up hating your job. At home you may say yes to family members who give you a hard time to avoid their emotional rejection, only to feel frustrated by the lack of quality time that you have for yourself. We work hard to manage the perceptions of others, ignoring our own needs, and in the end we give up the very thing that will enable us to live meaningful lives.",
		"The best thing I did as a manager was to make every person in the company responsible for doing just one thing. I had started doing this just to simplify the task of managing people. But then I noticed a deeper result: defining roles reduced conflict. Most fights inside a company happen when colleagues compete for the same responsibilities. Startup companies face an especially high risk of this since job roles are fluid at the early stages. Eliminating competition makes it easier for everyone to build the kinds of long­term relationships that transcend mere professionalism. More than that, internal peace is what enables a startup to survive at all. When a startup fails, we often imagine it surrendering to predatory rivals in a competitive ecosystem. But every company is also its own ecosystem, and internal conflict makes it vulnerable to outside threats.",
		"Traditionally, most ecologists assumed that community stability―the ability of a community to withstand environmental disturbances―is a consequence of community complexity. That is, a community with considerable species richness may function better and be more stable than a community with less species richness. According to this view, the greater the species richness, the less critically important any single species should be. With many possible interactions within the community, it is unlikely that any single disturbance could affect enough components of the system to make a significant difference in its functioning. Evidence for this hypothesis includes the fact that destructive outbreaks of pests are more common in cultivated fields, which are low-diversity communities, than in natural communities with greater species richness.",
		"Do you know one of the best remedies for coping with family tension? Two words: “I’m sorry.” It’s amazing how hard some people find them to say. They think it implies weakness or defeat. Nothing of the kind. In fact, it is exactly the opposite. Another good way of relieving tension is a row! The sea is ever so much calmer after a storm. A row has another advantage. When tempers are raised, unspoken truths usually come out. They may hurt a bit, especially at the time. Yet, at the end, you know each other a bit better. Lastly, most of the tensions and quarrels between children are natural. Even when they seem to be constant, wise parents don’t worry too much.",
		"The discovery that attitudes don’t always reflect actions came as a great surprise. Richard LaPiere, a professor at Standford University, gave a powerful demonstration of the disconnect between attitude and behavior in the 1930s. He traveled around the US with some colleagues from China. At the time, many people in the US had a negative opinion of Chinese people. LaPiere wrote to hotels and restaurants along the route, asking whether they would accommodate him and his Chinese guests. Of the 128 who wrote back, 92 percent told him that they would refuse to serve Chinese customers. But when he traveled around the country, visiting the same hotels and restaurants, the Chinese travelers were treated with courtesy in 249 out of 250 establishments. Remarkably, the powerful unfavorable attitudes didn’t predict actual behavior.",
		"Sadness in our culture is often considered an unnecessary and undesirable emotion. Numerous self­help books promote the benefits of positive thinking and positive behaviors, assigning negative affect in general, and sadness in particular, to the category of “problem emotions” that need to be eliminated. Much of the psychology profession is employed in managing and relieving sadness. Yet some degree of sadness and depression has been far more accepted in previous historical ages than is the case today. From the classic philosophers through Shakespeare to the works of Chekhov, Ibsen, and the great novels of the 19th century, exploring the emotions of sadness, longing, and depression has long been considered instructive. It is only recently that a thriving industry promoting positivity has managed to remove this earlier and more balanced view of human affectivity.",
		"Even if lying doesn’t have any harmful effects in a particular case, it is still morally wrong because, if discovered, lying weakens the general practice of truth telling on which human communication relies. For instance, if I were to lie about my age on grounds of vanity, and my lying were discovered, even though no serious harm would have been done, I would have undermined your trust generally. In that case you would be far less likely to believe anything I might say in the future. Thus all lying, when discovered, has indirect harmful effects. However, very occasionally, these harmful effects might possibly be outweighed by the benefits which arise from a lie. For example, if someone is seriously ill, lying to them about their life expectancy might probably give them a chance of living longer. On the other hand, telling them the truth could possibly induce a depression that would decelerate their physical decline.",
		"Sometimes our judgments of ourselves are unreasonably negative. This is especially true for people with low self­esteem. Several studies have shown that such people tend to magnify the importance of their failures. They often underestimate their abilities. And when they get negative feedback, such as a bad evaluation at work or a disrespectful remark from someone they know, they are likely to believe that it accurately reflects their self­worth. People with low self­esteem also have a higher­than­average risk of being depressed. This hurts not only an individual’s mental and emotional well­being but also his or her physical health and the quality of his or her social relationships.",
		"Dworkin suggests a classic argument for a certain kind of equality of opportunity. From Dworkin’s view, justice requires that a person’s fate be determined by things that are within that person’s control, not by luck. If differences in well­being are determined by circumstances lying outside of an individual’s control, they are unjust. According to this argument, inequality of well­being that is driven by differences in individual choices or tastes is acceptable. But we should seek to eliminate inequality of well­being that is driven by factors that are not an individual’s responsibility and which prevent an individual from achieving what he or she values. We do so by ensuring equality of opportunity or equality of access to fundamental resources.",
		"A lot of people find that physical movement can sometimes dispel negative feelings. If we are feeling negative, it can be very easy for us to stop wanting to stay active in our everyday life. This is why many people who suffer from depression are also found sleeping in and having no motivation to go outside or exercise. Unfortunately, this lack of exercise can actually compound many negative emotions. Exercise and movement is a great way for us to start getting rid of negative energies. Many people find that when they are angry, they go into a state where they want to exercise or clean. This is actually a very healthy and positive thing for you to do and a great way for you to begin to deconstruct your negative emotions so that they no longer affect your life and harm your relationships.",
		"A phenomenon in social psychology, the Pratfall Effect states that an individual’s perceived attractiveness increases or decreases after he or she makes a mistake―depending on the individual’s perceived competence. As celebrities are generally considered to be competent individuals, and often even presented as flawless or perfect in certain aspects, committing blunders will make one’s humanness endearing to others. Basically, those who never make mistakes are perceived as being less attractive and “likable” than those who make occasional mistakes. Perfection, or the attribution of that quality to individuals, creates a perceived distance that the general public cannot relate to―making those who never make mistakes perceived as being less attractive or likable. However, this can also have the opposite effect―if a perceived average or less than average competent person makes a mistake, he or she will be less attractive and likable to others.",
		"The ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians were the Western world’s philosophical forebears. In their concept of the world, nature was not an opponent in life’s struggles. Rather, man and nature were in the same boat, companions in the same story. Man thought of the natural world in the same terms as he thought of himself and other men. The natural world had thoughts, desires, and emotions, just like humans. Thus, the realms of man and nature were indistinguishable and did not have to be understood in cognitively different ways. Natural phenomena were imagined in the same terms as human experience. These ancients of the Near East did recognize the relation of cause and effect, but when speculating about it they came from a “who” rather than a “what” perspective. When the Nile rose, it was because the river wanted to, not because it had rained.",
		"Our culture is biased toward the fine arts—those creative products that have no function other than pleasure. Craft objects are less worthy; because they serve an everyday function, they’re not purely creative. But this division is culturally and historically relative. Most contemporary high art began as some sort of craft. The composition and performance of what we now call “classical music” began as a form of craft music satisfying required functions in the Catholic mass, or the specific entertainment needs of royal patrons. For example, chamber music really was designed to be performed in chambers—small intimate rooms in wealthy homes—often as background music. The dances composed by famous composers from Bach to Chopin originally did indeed accompany dancing. But today, with the contexts and functions they were composed for gone, we listen to these works as fine art.",
		"A story is only as believable as the storyteller. For story to be effective, trust must be established. Yes, trust. Whenever someone stops to listen to you, an element of unspoken trust exists. Your listener unconsciously trusts you to say something worthwhile to him, something that will not waste his time. The few minutes of attention he is giving you is sacrificial. He could choose to spend his time elsewhere, yet he has stopped to respect your part in a conversation. This is where story comes in. Because a story illustrates points clearly and often bridges topics easily, trust can be established quickly, and recognizing this time element to story is essential to trust. Respecting your listener’s time is the capital letter at the beginning of your sentence―it leads the conversation into a sentence worth listening to if trust is earned and not taken for granted.",
		"On projects in the built environment, people consider safety and functionality nonnegotiable. But the aesthetics of a new project— how it is designed— is too often considered irrelevant. The question of how its design affects human beings is rarely asked. People think that design makes something highfalutin, called architecture, and that architecture differs from building, just as surely as the Washington National Cathedral differs from the local community church. This distinction between architecture and building—or more generally, between design and utility— couldn’t be more wrong. More and more we are learning that the design of all our built environments matters so profoundly that safety and functionality must not be our only urgent priorities. All kinds of design elements influence people’s experiences, not only of the environment but also of themselves. They shape our cognitions, emotions, and actions, and even our well-being. They actually help constitute our very sense of identity.",
		"When discussing the animal kingdom, each creature belongs to a species scale of generalists to specialists. Specialist creatures like the koala bear can only survive on an extremely limited set of conditions: diet (eucalyptus), climate (warm), environment (trees). Generalists, on the other hand (think mice), are able to survive just about anywhere. They can withstand heat and cold, eat your organic breakfast cereal or seeds and berries in the wild. So, specialist species thrive only when conditions are perfect. They serve a very specific purpose within their particular ecosystem and are good at navigating it. However, should those conditions change—as a result of nature or, more commonly, an outside force— specialist species often become extinct. In contrast, mice can move from spot to spot on the globe, adapt to different cultures, diets and weather systems. And most importantly, they stay alive.",
		"Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness. Physicists have given a fully quantitative definition to entropy that allows one to describe something’s entropy by using a definite numerical value: larger numbers mean greater entropy, smaller numbers mean less entropy. Although the details are a little complicated, this number, roughly speaking, counts the possible rearrangements of the ingredients in a given physical system that leave its overall appearance intact. When your desk is neat and clean, almost any arrangement―changing the order of the newspapers, books, or articles, moving the pens from their holders―will upset its highly ordered organization. This accounts for its having low entropy. On the contrary, when your desk is a mess, numerous rearrangements of the newspapers, articles, and junk mail will leave it a mess and therefore will not disturb its overall look. This accounts for its having high entropy.",
		"Although children watch television at various times, the programming that they view alone tends to be specifically aimed at children. In the United States particularly, most of the advertising during this segment consists of ads for food, particularly sugared food. During the run-up to Christmas, increasing numbers of ads concern toys and games. Such practices are believed to put pressure on parents to yield to what the media have dubbed “pester power.” This has led to calls for legislation to regulate advertising in Europe and the United States. Indeed, the Swedish government has outlawed television advertising of products aimed at children under 12, and recently in the United States, 50 psychologists signed a petition calling for a ban on the advertising of children’s goods.",
		"In “The Frog Prince” story, a princess loses her favorite ball in a pond. However, a frog appears and promises to retrieve her ball if she lets him eat at her table, drink from her cup, and sleep in her bed. Desperate to have her ball back, the princess agrees, but when the frog appears at her door the next day she is disgusted by the prospect of being truthful and fulfilling her promise. But her father, the king, gives her no choice and she is compelled to carry out her promise. When the promise has been fulfilled the frog disappears, its place being taken by a handsome prince with whom she falls in love. Grateful that she has been truthful and kept her promise, even if it was at her father’s insistence , the prince marries the princess and they live happily ever after.",
		"It is often believed that an active person can make friends more easily than a shy person, and that a conscientious person may meet more deadlines than a person who is not conscientious. Walter Mischel found, however, that the typical correlation between personality traits and behavior was quite modest . This news was really shocking, because it essentially said that the traits personality psychologists were measuring were just slightly better at predicting behavior than astrological signs. Mischel did not simply point out the problem; he diagnosed the reasons for it. He argued that personality psychologists had underestimated the extent to which the social situation shapes people’s behavior, independently of their personality. To predict whether a person will meet a deadline, for example, knowing something about the situation may be more useful than knowing the person’s score on a measure of conscientiousness. Situational influences can be very powerful, sometimes overwhelming individual differences in personality.",
		"The desert locust lives in two remarkably different styles depending on the availability of food sources and the density of the local locust population. When food is scarce, as it usually is in their native desert habitat, locusts are born with coloring designed for camouflage and lead solitary lives. But when rare periods of significant rain produce major vegetation growth, everything changes. At first, the locusts continue to be loners, just feasting off the abundant food supply. But as the extra vegetation starts to die off, the locusts find themselves crowded together. Suddenly, baby locusts are born with bright colors and a preference for company. Instead of avoiding one another and hiding from predators through camouflage and inactivity, these locusts gather in vast groups, feed together, and overwhelm their predators simply through numbers.",
		"Until the mid­20th century, only a few immigrants paid a visit to their homeland once or twice before they died, but most never returned to the land of their birth. This pattern has completely changed with the advent of globalization, coupled with the digital revolution that has enhanced communication. As a result, immigration is a very different experience from what it was in the past. The ability of immigrant families to reconnect to their old culture via phone, television, and the Internet has changed their approach to integration into mainstream American society. This has also greatly influenced immigrant practices of socialization with children. Contacts with the country of origin are now more frequent, and result in more immigrant families being influenced to maintain cultural patterns from the homeland, and to attempt to influence their children to keep them.",
		"With a power gap, the more hierarchical your culture or background, the greater the power gap is apt to be. This is because hierarchical cultures reinforce the differences between managers and employees. If you tend to be more hierarchical in your orientation, you tend to put those in positions of authority at a higher level, and there is more respect for that status or position, divorced even from the person who occupies it. Distance is seen as good if you have a hierarchical preference. It wouldn’t be proper for a manager to be too familiar with his employees. The effect is that any power gap that exists is magnified through the lens of this dimension. A greater power gap can result in decreased communication as well as increased misunderstandings and conflict, potentially leading to missed opportunities for building significant business and career relationships.",
		"In 2001, researchers at Wayne State University asked a group of college volunteers to exercise for twenty minutes at a self-selected pace on each of three machines: a treadmill, a stationary bike, and a stair climber. Measurements of heart rate, oxygen consumption, and perceived effort were taken throughout all three workouts. The researchers expected to find that the subjects unconsciously targeted the same relative physiological intensity in each activity. Perhaps they would automatically exercise at 65 percent of their maximum heart rate regardless of which machine they were using. Or maybe they would instinctively settle into rhythm at 70 percent of their maximum rate of oxygen consumption in all three workouts. But that’s not what happened. There was, in fact, no consistency in measurements of heart rate and oxygen consumption across the three disciplines. Instead, the subjects were found to have chosen the same level of perceived effort on the treadmill, the bike, and the stair climber.",
		"The theory of E­prime argues that if you wrote and spoke English without the verb to be, you’d describe events more accurately. For example, when you say, “Johnny is a failure,” the verb is implies that “failure” is in Johnny rather than in your observation of Johnny. The verb to be (in forms such as is, are, and am) also implies permanence; the implication is that because failure is in Johnny, it will always be there; Johnny will always be a failure. A more precise statement might be “Johnny failed his last two math exams.” Consider this theory as applied to your thinking about yourself. When you say, for example, “I’m not good at public speaking” or “I’m unpopular” or “I’m lazy,” you imply that these qualities are in you. But these are simply evaluations that may be incorrect or, if at least partly accurate, may change over time.",
		"You can’t have a democracy if you can’t talk with your neighbors about matters of mutual interest or concern. Thomas Jefferson, who had an enduring interest in democracy, came to a similar conclusion. He was prescient in understanding the dangers of concentrated power, whether in corporations or in political leaders or exclusionary political institutions. Direct involvement of citizens was what had made the American Revolution possible and given the new republic vitality and hope for the future. Without that involvement, the republic would die. Eventually, he saw a need for the nation to be subdivided into “wards”―political units so small that everyone living there could participate directly in the political process. The representatives for each ward in the capital would have to be responsive to citizens organized in this way. A vibrant democracy conducted locally would then provide the active basic unit for the democratic life of the republic. With that kind of involvement, the republic might survive and prosper.",
		"Until the twentieth century, when composers began experimenting freely with form and design, classical music continued to follow basic rules relating to structure, not to mention harmony. There still was room for individuality ―the great composers didn’t follow the rules, but made the rules follow them―yet there was always a fundamental proportion and logic behind the design. Even after many of the rules were overturned by radical concepts in more recent times, composers, more often than not, still organized their thoughts in ways that produced an overall, unifying structure. That’s one reason the atonal, incredibly complex works by Arnold Schönberg or Karlheinz Stockhausen, to name two twentieth­century Modernists, are nonetheless approachable. The sounds might be very strange, but the results are still decidedly classical in terms of organization.",
		"Some coaches erroneously believe that mental skills training (MST) can only help perfect the performance of highly skilled competitors. As a result, they shy away from MST, rationalizing that because they are not coaching elite athletes, mental skills training is less important. It is true that mental skills become increasingly important at high levels of competition. As athletes move up the competitive ladder, they become more homogeneous in terms of physical skills. In fact, at high levels of competition, all athletes have the physical skills to be successful. Consequently, any small difference in mental factors can play a huge role in determining performance outcomes. However, we can anticipate that personal growth and performance will progress faster in young, developing athletes who are given mental skills training than in athletes not exposed to MST. In fact, the optimal time for introducing MST may be when athletes are first beginning their sport. Introducing MST early in athletes’ careers may lay the foundation that will help them develop to their full potential.",
		"Why does the “pure” acting of the movies not seem unnatural to the audience, who, after all, are accustomed in real life to people whose expression is more or less indistinct? Most people’s perception in these matters is not very sharp. They are not in the habit of observing closely the play of features of their fellow men―either in real life or at the movies. They are satisfied with grasping the meaning of what they see. Thus, they often take in the overemphasized expression of film actors more easily than any that is too naturalistic. And as far as lovers of art are concerned, they do not look at the movies for imitations of nature but for art. They know that artistic representation is always explaining, refining, and making clear the object depicted. Things that in real life are imperfectly realized, merely hinted at, and entangled with other things appear in a work of art complete, entire, and free from irrelevant matters. This is also true of acting in film.",
		"In literature as distinct from journalism, the ablest writers will never assume that the bare bones of a story can be enough to win over their audience. They will not suppose that an attack or a flood or a theft must in and of itself carry some intrinsic degree of interest which will cause the reader to be appropriately moved or outraged. These writers know that no event, however shocking, can ever guarantee involvement ; for this latter prize, they must work harder, practicing their distinctive craft, which means paying attention to language and keeping a tight rein on pace and structure. In certain situations, creative writers may even choose to sacrifice strict accuracy, and rather than feel that they are thereby carrying out a criminal act, they will instead understand that falsifications may occasionally need to be committed in the service of a goal higher still than accuracy.",
		"Hypothesis is a tool which can cause trouble if not used properly. We must be ready to abandon or modify our hypothesis as soon as it is shown to be inconsistent with the facts. This is not as easy as it sounds. When delighted by the way one’s beautiful idea offers promise of further advances, it is tempting to overlook an observation that does not fit into the pattern woven, or to try to explain it away. It is not at all rare for investigators to adhere to their broken hypotheses, turning a blind eye to contrary evidence, and not altogether unknown for them to deliberately suppress contrary results. If the experimental results or observations are definitely opposed to the hypothesis or if they necessitate overly complicated or improbable subsidiary hypotheses to accommodate them, one has to discard the idea with as few regrets as possible. It is easier to drop the old hypothesis if one can find a new one to replace it. The feeling of disappointment too will then vanish.",
		"According to Derek Bickerton, human ancestors and relatives such as the Neanderthals may have had a relatively large lexicon of words, each of which related to a mental concept such as ‘meat’, ‘fire’, ‘hunt’ and so forth. They were able to string such words together but could do so only in a nearly arbitrary fashion. Bickerton recognizes that this could result in some ambiguity. For instance, would ‘man killed bear’ have meant that a man has killed a bear or that a bear has killed a man? Ray Jackendoff, a cognitive scientist, suggests that simple rules such as ‘agent­first’ (that is, the man killed the bear) might have reduced the potential ambiguity. Nevertheless, the number and complexity of potential utterances would have been severely limited. The transformation of such proto­language into language required the evolution of grammar― rules that define the order in which a finite number of words can be strung together to create an infinite number of utterances, each with a specific meaning.",
		"For every toxic substance, process, or product in use today, there is a safer alternative―either already in existence, or waiting to be discovered through the application of human intellect, ingenuity, and effort. In almost every case, the safer alternative is available at a comparable cost. Industry may reject these facts and complain about the high cost of acting, but history sets the record straight. The chemical industry denied that there were practical alternatives to ozone-depleting chemicals, predicting not only economic disaster but numerous deaths because food and vaccines would spoil without refrigeration. They were wrong. The motor vehicle industry initially denied that cars caused air pollution, then claimed that no technology existed to reduce pollution from vehicles, and later argued that installing devices to reduce air pollution would make cars extremely expensive. They were wrong every time. The pesticide industry argues that synthetic pesticides are absolutely necessary to grow food. Thousands of organic farmers are proving them wrong.",
		"The conscious preference for apparent simplicity in the early-twentieth-century modernist movement in prose and poetry was echoed in what is known as the International Style of architecture. The new literature avoided old-fashioned words, elaborate images, grammatical inversions, and sometimes even meter and rhyme. In the same way, one of the basic principles of early modernist architecture was that every part of a building must be functional, without any unnecessary or fancy additions. Most International Style architecture aggressively banned moldings and sometimes even window and door frames. Like the prose of Hemingway or Samuel Beckett, it proclaimed, and sometimes proved, that less was more. But some modern architects, unfortunately, designed buildings that looked simple and elegant but didn’t in fact function very well: their flat roofs leaked in wet climates and their metal railings and window frames rusted. Absolute simplicity, in most cases, remained an ideal rather than a reality, and in the early twentieth century complex architectural decorations continued to be used in many private and public buildings.",
		"One factor contributing to students’ difficulty in making accurate judgments of their own knowledge is hindsight bias: the tendency to assume once something happens that one knew all along that it was going to happen. When students receive feedback suggesting that their knowledge is incomplete, such as getting an exam item incorrect, they may respond by telling themselves that they actually did know the information. Although they do not have a strong grasp of the material, they feel as if they do because they recognize something about the item content. Looking back, once they know the answer, the solution seems obvious. This feeling of familiarity can lead students to have an exaggerated sense of what they know. Hindsight bias therefore reinforces the feeling that their failure was due to the nature of the assessment rather than the nature of their knowledge―which makes it more difficult for them to learn from feedback.",
		"To the extent that an agent relies on the prior knowledge of its designer rather than on its own percepts, we say that the agent lacks autonomy. A rational agent should be autonomous― it should learn what it can to compensate for partial or incorrect prior knowledge. For example, a vacuum-cleaning agent that learns to foresee where and when additional dirt will appear will dobetter than one that does not. As a practical matter, one seldom requires complete autonomy from the start: when the agent has had little or no experience, it would have to act randomly unless the designer gave some assistance. So, just as evolution provides animals with enough built-in reflexes to survive long enough to learn for themselves, it would be reasonable to provide an artificial intelligent agent with some initial knowledge as well as an ability to learn. After sufficient experience of its environment, the behavior of a rational agent can become effectively independent of its prior knowledge. Hence, the incorporation of learning allows one to design a single rational agent that will succeed in a vast variety of environments.",
		"The Atitlán Giant Grebe was a large, flightless bird that had evolved from the much more widespread and smaller Pied-billed Grebe. By 1965 there were only around 80 birds left on Lake Atitlán. One immediate reason was easy enough to spot: the local human population was cutting down the reed beds at a furious rate. This destruction was driven by the needs of a fast growing mat-making industry. But there were other problems. An American airline was intent on developing the lake as a tourist destination for fishermen. However, there was a major problem with this idea: the lake lacked any suitable sporting fish! To compensate for this rather obvious defect, a specially selected species of fish called the Large-mouthed Bass was introduced. The introduced individuals immediately turned their attentions to the crabs and small fish that lived in the lake, thus competing with the few remaining grebes for food. There is also little doubt that they sometimes gobbled up the zebra-striped Atitlán Giant Grebe’s chicks.",
		"When teachers work in isolation, they tend to see the world through one set of eyes─their own. The fact that there might be someone somewhere in the same building or district who may be more successful at teaching this or that subject or lesson is lost on teachers who close the door and work their way through the school calendar virtually alone. In the absence of a process that allows them to benchmark those who do things better or at least differently, teachers are left with that one perspective─their own. I taught various subjects under the social studies umbrella and had very little idea of how my peers who taught the same subject did what they did. The idea of meeting regularly to compare notes, plan common assessments, and share what we did well never occurred to us. Rather, we spent much time in the social studies office complaining about a lack of time and playing the blame game.",
		"The brain makes up just two percent of our body weight but uses 20 percent of our energy. In newborns, it’s no less than 65 percent. That’s partly why babies sleep all the time —their growing brains exhaust them—and have a lot of body fat, to use as an energy reserve when needed. Our muscles use even more of our energy, about a quarter of the total, but we have a lot of muscle. Actually, per unit of matter, the brain uses by far more energy than our other organs. That means that the brain is the most expensive of our organs. But it is also marvelously efficient. Our brains require only about four hundred calories of energy a day—about the same as we get from a blueberry muffin. Try running your laptop for twenty‒four hours on a muffin and see how far you get.",
		"You can use a third party to compliment a person you want to befriend and still get the “credit” for making the target of your compliment feel good about themselves and, by extension, feel good about you. When you directly compliment other people, particularly anybody who suspects you might want something from them, they tend to discount your efforts because they suspect you are intentionally trying to influence them through flattery. A third-party compliment eliminates this skepticism. To construct a third-party compliment you will need to find a mutual friend or acquaintance who knows both you and your person of interest. Further, you should be relatively certain that the third-party individual you choose will be likely to pass along your compliment to the person for whom it was intended. If this clarification of information is successful, the next time you meet your person of interest, he or she will see you from a positive perspective.",
		"Frank Conroy was an American author born in New York, New York to an American father and a Danish mother. He published five books, including the highly acclaimed memoir Stop‒Time. Published in 1967, this ultimately made Conroy a noted figure in the literary world. Conroy graduated from Haverford College and was the director of the influential Iowa Writers’ Workshop at the University of Iowa for 18 years, from 1987 until 2005. In addition to writing, Conroy was an accomplished jazz pianist, winning a Grammy Award in 1986. Conroy died of colon cancer on April 6, 2005, in Iowa City, Iowa, at the age of 69.

		"The addax is a kind of antelope found in some areas in the Sahara Desert. It has twisted horns and short, thick legs. It is an endangered mammal and there are only about 500 left in the wild. The head and body length of the addax measures 150-170 centimeters. Males are slightly taller than females. The coat of the addax changes in color depending on the season. In winter, the addax is grayish­brown with white legs. During summer, their coat gets lighter, and is almost completely white. The addax prefers sandy desert areas and stony deserts. The addax is mostly active at night due to the heat of the desert.",
		"Kaspar Fürstenau was a German flutist and composer. After he was orphaned, Anton Romberg took care of him and taught him to play the bassoon, but Fürstenau was more interested in the flute. At the age of 15, he was already a skilled flutist and played in a military band. In 1793-94, Fürstenau made his first concert tour in Germany. In 1794, he became a member of the “Chamber Orchestra of Oldenburg,” where he played until the orchestra was abolished in 1811. Kaspar Fürstenau continued his career as a flutist performing together with his son Anton Fürstenau in the major cities of Europe.",
		"Deep within the jungle of the southeast Indonesian province of Papua lives the Korowai tribe. Until their discovery by a Dutch man in 1974, the Korowai had hardly any contact with the outside world. The Korowai are still self-sufficient, producing almost everything themselves. Korowai families have their own gardens nearby, in which they cultivate sweet potatoes and vegetables. They live off whatever nature provides in their immediate surroundings. They raise pigs as a means of exchange and dogs for hunting. The Korowai people live in houses high up in the trees. The houses protect families not only against a mass of mosquitoes below but also against annoying neighbors and evil spirits.",
		"Clara Barton was born on Christmas Day in 1821 in Massachusetts. At the age of seventeen, Barton began to work as a schoolteacher in a summer school and later decided to get a degree in education. She went to college in New York and graduated in 1851. She worked at a private school and eventually opened her own school in New Jersey in 1853. After that, she worked for a government office in Washington D.C., where she was fired just because she was a woman. It made her fight for the rights of women to be treated equally in the work place. Throughout the Civil War, Barton nursed wounded soldiers back to health and became known as the “Angel of the Battlefield.” While traveling overseas Barton learned of an organization called the International Red Cross. She wanted to bring the organization to America. It took a lot of effort, but Barton finally founded the American Red Cross in 1881.",
		"Nathaniel Adams Cole was born in Alabama on March 17, 1919. Cole learned piano from his mother, and both he and his older brother Eddie became professional musicians by their teens. As a teenager Cole organized two musical groups, the Rogues of Rhythm and the Royal Dukes. At 15, he dropped out of school to become a full-time jazz piano player. After he found a job as a pianist at the Century Club in Santa Monica, he formed a trio with Oscar Moore and Wesley Prince in 1939. In 1951, however, the trio officially broke up. After that, Cole emerged as a popular solo vocalist. He released more than forty albums and contributed to the introduction of “race music” to the larger American musical scene.",
		"Nauru is an island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. It is located about 800 miles to the northeast of the Solomon Islands; its closest neighbor is the island of Banaba, some 200 miles to the east. Nauru has no official capital, but government buildings are located in Yaren. With a population of about 10,000, Nauru is the smallest country in the South Pacific and the third smallest country by area in the world. The native people of Nauru consist of 12 tribes, as symbolized by the 12-pointed star on the Nauru flag, and are believed to be a mixture of Micronesian, Polynesian, and Melanesian. Their native language is Nauruan, but English is widely spoken as it is used for government and business purposes.",
		"Eddie Adams was born in New Kensington, Pennsylvania. He developed his passion for photography in his teens, when he became a staff photographer for his high school paper. After graduating, he joined the United States Marine Corps, where he captured scenes from the Korean War as a combat photographer. In 1958, he became staff at the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin, a daily evening newspaper published in Philadelphia. In 1962, he joined the Associated Press (AP), and after 10 years, he left the AP to work as a freelancer for Time magazine.

He shot more than 350 covers of magazines with portraits of political leaders such as Deng Xiaoping, Richard Nixon, and George Bush.",
		"Born in 1867 in Cincinnati, Ohio, Charles Henry Turner was an early pioneer in the field of insect behavior. His father owned an extensive library where Turner became fascinated with reading about the habits and behavior of insects. Proceeding with his study, Turner earned a doctorate degree in zoology, the first African American to do so. Even after receiving his degree, Turner was unable to get a teaching or research position at any major universities, possibly as a result of racism. He moved to St. Louis and taught biology at Sumner High School, focusing on research there until 1922. Turner was the first person to discover that insects are capable of learning, illustrating that insects can alter behavior based on previous experience. He died of cardiac disease in Chicago in 1923. During his 33-year career, Turner published more than 70 papers. His last scientific paper was published the year after his death.",
		"Edith Wharton was born into a wealthy family in 1862 in New York City. Educated by private tutors at home, she enjoyed reading and writing early on. After her first novel, The Valley of Decision, was published in 1902, she wrote many novels and some gained her a wide audience. Wharton also had a great love of architecture, and she designed and built her first real home. During World War I, she devoted much of her time to assisting orphans from France and Belgium and helped raise funds to support them. After the war, she settled in Provence, France, and she finished writing The Age of Innocence there. This novel won Wharton the 1921 Pulitzer Prize, making her the first woman to win the award.",
		"Joshua trees are evergreen, with numerous, sharp­pointed leaves at the ends of their branches. The unique appearance of the Joshua tree makes it a very desirable decoration. Unfortunately, many Joshua trees have been dug up to be planted in urban areas, despite a very low rate of survival when removed and planted in other places. Native Americans roasted and ate their flower buds. Young seeds were eaten raw or cooked (and said to taste like bananas). Alcoholic drinks were made from their flowers, too. But Joshua trees are hard to eat by today’s standards, and have little possibility of ever becoming a commercial food crop because they are protected by law.",
		"James Van Der Zee was born on June 29, 1886, in Lenox, Massachusetts. The second of six children, James grew up in a family of creative people. At the age of fourteen he received his first camera and took hundreds of photographs of his family and town. By 1906, he had moved to New York, married, and was taking jobs to support his growing family. In 1907, he moved to Phoetus, Virginia, where he worked in the dining room of the Hotel Chamberlin. During this time he also worked as a photographer on a part­time basis. He opened his own studio in 1916. World WarⅠhad begun and many young soldiers came to the studio to have their pictures taken. In 1969, the exhibition, Harlem On My Mind, brought him international recognition. He died in 1983.",
		"Dorothy West, born on June 2, 1907, is remembered as one of the Harlem Renaissance writers. West’s subject matter primarily focused on the life of rich African Americans. Her first novel, The Living Is Easy, published in 1948, received positive responses from critics, but failed to attract a large audience. She wrote her second novel, The Wedding, in 1950, but left it incomplete because she was unable to find a publisher. Jacqueline Onassis took note of the short stories that West had been submitting to the Daily News, the local paper at Martha’s Vineyard. Onassis encouraged West to complete her novel and subsequently served as her editor. Her second novel was published in 1995 and was made into a television movie produced by Oprah Winfrey, airing in 1998. West died on August 16, 1998.",
		"Born in 1867, Sarah Breedlove was an American businesswoman and social activist. Orphaned at the age of seven, her early life was marked by hardship. In 1888, she moved to St. Louis, where she worked as a washerwoman for more than a decade, earning barely more than a dollar a day. During this time, long hours of backbreaking labor and a poor diet caused her hair to fall out. She tried everything that was available but had no success. After working as a maid for a chemist, she invented a successful hair care product and sold it across the country. Not only did she sell, she also recruited and trained lots of women as sales agents for a share of the profits. In the process she became America’s first self-made female millionaire and she gave Black women everywhere an opportunity for financial independence.",

Evans’ expressive piano works and his unique harmonic approach inspired a whole generation of musicians.",
		"Chuckwallas are fat lizards, usually 20-25cm long, though they may grow up to 45cm. They weigh about 1.5kg when mature. Most chuckwallas are mainly brown or black. Just after the annual molt, the skin is shiny. Lines of dark brown run along the back and continue down the tail. As the males grow older, these brown lines disappear and the body color becomes lighter; the tail becomes almost white. It is not easy to distinguish between male and female chuckwallas, because young males look like females and the largest females resemble males.",
		"Jaroslav Heyrovsky was born in Prague on December 20, 1890, as the fifth child of Leopold Heyrovsky. In 1901 Jaroslav went to a secondary school called the Akademicke Gymnasium. Rather than Latin and Greek, he showed a strong interest in the natural sciences. At Czech University in Prague he studied chemistry, physics, and mathematics. From 1910 to 1914 he continued his studies at University College, London. Throughout the First World War, Jaroslav served in a military hospital.

Warthogs can reach 4 to 6 feet in length and between 110 and 260 pounds in weight. Males are 20 to 50 pounds heavier than females. Warthogs keep their tails in the upright position when they are running. In that position, their tails look like flags in the wind. Warthogs have poor eyesight, but excellent senses of smell and hearing.",
		"orothy Hodgkin was born in Cairo in 1910, where her father worked in the Egyptian Education Service. Her interest in chemistry started when she was just ten years old. In 1949, she worked on the structure of penicillin with her colleagues. Her work on vitamin B12 was published in 1954, which led to her being awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964. She also became the first woman to receive the Copley Medal and was a winner of the Lenin Peace Prize. Hodgkin showed great concern for social inequalities and resolving conflicts. As a result, she was president of the Pugwash Conferences from 1976 to 1988.",
		"Elsie Inglis, the second daughter of John Inglis, was born in India on 16th August, 1864. She had the good fortune to have enlightened parents who considered the education of a daughter as important as that of a son. With the support of her father, she began to train as a doctor. Terrified by the poor medical treatment for female patients, she founded a hospital for women in Edinburgh in which the staff consisted only of women. She was also actively engaged in politics and worked for women’s voting rights. The outbreak of the First World War turned her attention to helping the troops, and she organized fourteen medical units to send to battlefields throughout Europe. Caring for both soldiers and civilians suffering from sickness, Inglis became ill in Russia and was forced to return to Britain, where she died in 1917. She is still remembered as a wonderful woman of enthusiasm, strength, and kindliness.",

Her family did not approve when she decided to become an artist, but her desire was so strong, she bravely took the steps to make art her career. She studied first in Philadelphia and then went to Paris to study painting. She admired the work of Edgar Degas and was able to meet him in Paris, which was a great inspiration. Though she never had children of her own, she loved children and painted portraits of the children of her friends and family. Cassatt lost her sight at the age of seventy, and, sadly, was not able to paint during the later years of her life.",
		"George Boole was born in Lincoln, England in 1815. Boole was forced to leave school at the age of sixteen after his father’s business collapsed. He taught himself mathematics, natural philosophy and various languages. He began to produce original mathematical research and made important contributions to areas of mathematics. For those contributions, in 1844, he was awarded a gold medal for mathematics by the Royal Society. Boole was deeply interested in expressing the workings of the human mind in symbolic form, and his two books on this subject, The Mathematical Analysis of Logic and An Investigation of the Laws of Thought form the basis of today’s computer science. In 1849, he was appointed the first professor of mathematics at Queen’s College in Cork, Ireland and taught there until his death in 1864.",
		"Ellen Church was born in Iowa in 1904. After graduating from Cresco High School, she studied nursing and worked as a nurse in San Francisco. She suggested to Boeing Air Transport that nurses should take care of passengers during flights because most people were frightened of flying. In 1930, she became the first female flight attendant in the U.S. and worked on a Boeing 80A from Oakland, California to Chicago, Illinois. Unfortunately, a car accident injury forced her to end her career after only eighteen months. Church started nursing again at Milwaukee County Hospital after she graduated from the University of Minnesota with a degree in nursing education. During World War II, she served as a captain in the Army Nurse Corps and received an Air Medal. Ellen Church Field Airport in her hometown, Cresco, was named after her.",

In addition to writing novels, poetry, short stories, and essays, Fauset taught French in public schools in Washington, D.C. and worked as a journal editor. While working as an editor, she encouraged many well­known writers of the Harlem Renaissance. Though she is more famous for being an editor than for being a fiction writer, many critics consider her novel Plum Bun Fauset’s strongest work. In it, she tells the story of a black girl who could pass for white but ultimately claims her racial identity and pride. Fauset died of heart disease April 30, 1961, in Philadelphia.",
		"Lithops are plants that are often called ‘living stones’ on account of their unique rock­like appearance. They are native to the deserts of South Africa but commonly sold in garden centers and nurseries. Lithops grow well in compacted, sandy soil with little water and extreme hot temperatures. Lithops are small plants, rarely getting more than an inch above the soil surface and usually with only two leaves. The thick leaves resemble the cleft in an animal’s foot or just a pair of grayish brown stones gathered together. The plants have no true stem and much of the plant is underground. Their appearance has the effect of conserving moisture.",
		"Paul Laurence Dunbar, an African­American poet, was born on June 27, 1872. By the age of fourteen, Dunbar had poems published in the Dayton Herald. While in high school he edited his high school newspaper. Despite being a fine student, Dunbar was financially unable to attend college and took a job as an elevator operator. In 1893, Dunbar published his first book, Oak and Ivy, at his own expense. In 1895, he published the second book, Majors and Minors, which brought him national and international recognition. The poems written in standard English were called “majors,” and those in dialect were termed “minors.” Although the “major” poems in standard English outnumber those written in dialect, it was the dialect poems that brought Dunbar the most attention.",
		"Bessie Coleman was born in Texas in 1892. When she was eleven, she was told that the Wright brothers had flown their first plane. Since that moment, she dreamed about the day she would soar through the sky. At the age of 23, Coleman moved to Chicago, where she worked at a restaurant to save money for flying lessons. However, she had to travel to Paris to take flying lessons because American flight schools at the time admitted neither women nor Black people. In 1921, she finally became the first Black woman to earn an international pilot’s license. She also studied flying acrobatics in Europe and made her first appearance in an airshow in New York in 1922. As a female pioneer of flight, she inspired the next generation to pursue their dreams of flying.",

		"Margaret Knight was an exceptionally prolific inventor in the late 19th century; journalists occasionally compared her to Thomas Edison by nicknaming her “a woman Edison.” From a young age, she built toys for her older brothers. After her father died, Knight’s family moved to Manchester. Knight left school in 1850, at age 12, to earn money for her family at a nearby textile factory, where she witnessed a fellow worker injured by faulty equipment. That led her to create her first invention, a safety device for textile equipment, but she never earned money from the invention. She also invented a machine that cut, folded and glued flat-bottomed paper bags and was awarded her first patent in 1871 for it. It eliminated the need for workers to assemble them slowly by hand. Knight received 27 patents in her lifetime and entered the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2006.",
		"Lilian Bland was born in Kent, England in 1878. Unlike most other girls at the time she wore trousers and spent her time enjoying adventurous activities like horse riding and hunting. Lilian began her career as a sports and wildlife photographer for British newspapers. In 1910 she became the first woman to design, build, and fly her own airplane. In order to persuade her to try a slightly safer activity, Lilian’s dad bought her a car. Soon Lilian was a master driver and ended up working as a car dealer. She never went back to flying but lived a long and exciting life nonetheless. She married, moved to Canada, and had a kid. Eventually, she moved back to England, and lived there for the rest of her life.",
		"Gary Becker was born in Pottsville, Pennsylvania in 1930 and grew up in Brooklyn, New York City. His father, who was not well educated, had a deep interest in financial and political issues. After graduating from high school, Becker went to Princeton University, where he majored in economics. He was dissatisfied with his economic education at Princeton University because “it didn’t seem to be handling real problems.” He earned a doctor’s degree in economics from the University of Chicago in 1955. His doctoral paper on the economics of discrimination was mentioned by the Nobel Prize Committee as an important contribution to economics. Since 1985, Becker had written a regular economics column in Business Week, explaining economic analysis and ideas to the general public. In 1992, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in economic science.",
		"Frederick Douglass was born into slavery at a farm in Maryland. His full name at birth was Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey. He changed his name to Frederick Douglass after he successfully escaped from slavery in 1838. He became a leader of the Underground Railroad―a network of people, places, and routes that helped enslaved people escape to the north. He assisted other runaway slaves until they could safely get to other areas in the north. As a slave, he had taught himself to read and write and he spread that knowledge to other slaves as well. Once free, he became a well-known abolitionist and strong believer in equality for all people including Blacks, Native Americans, women, and recent immigrants. He wrote several autobiographies describing his experiences as a slave. In addition to all this, he became the first African-American candidate for vice president of the United States.",
		"Lotte Laserstein was born into a Jewish family in East Prussia. One of her relatives ran a private painting school, which allowed Lotte to learn painting and drawing at a young age. Later, she earned admission to the Berlin Academy of Arts and completed her master studies as one of the first women in the school. In 1928 her career skyrocketed as she gained widespread recognition, but after the seizure of power by the Nazi Party, she was forbidden to exhibit her artwork in Germany. In 1937 she emigrated to Sweden. She continued to work in Sweden but never recaptured the fame she had enjoyed before. In her work, Lotte repeatedly portrayed Gertrud Rose, her closest friend. To Lotte, she embodied the type of the “New Woman” and was so represented.",
		"Vera Rubin was born in 1928 in Philadelphia and grew up in Washington, D.C. It was in Washington, D.C. that she started to develop an interest in astronomy. She earned a master’s degree from Cornell University in 1951 and a doctor’s degree from Georgetown University in 1954. At the age of 22, she made headlines and shocked scientists with her theory about the motion of galaxies. In 1965, Rubin started as a researcher at the Carnegie Institution and became the first woman permitted to use the Hale Telescope. She made groundbreaking observations that provided evidence for the existence of a vast amount of dark matter in the universe. She won many prizes for her work, but never the Nobel Prize. She died in 2016 and is celebrated as someone who worked to lead the way for women in astronomy and physics.",
		"Alice Coachman was born in 1923, in Albany, Georgia, U.S.A. Since she was unable to access athletic training facilities because of the racism of the time, she trained using what was available to her, running barefoot along the dirt roads near her home and using homemade equipment to practice her jumping. Her talent in track and field was noticeable as early as elementary school. Coachman kept practicing hard and gained attention with her achievements in several competitions during her time in high school and college. In the 1948 London Olympics, Coachman competed in the high jump, reaching 5 feet, 6.5 inches, setting both an Olympic and an American record. This accomplishment made her the first black woman to win an Olympic gold medal. She is in nine different Halls of Fame, including the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame. Coachman died in 2014, at the age of 90 in Georgia after she had dedicated her life to education.",
		"Ingrid Bergman was born in Stockholm, Sweden on August 29, 1915. Her mother was German and her father Swedish. Her mother died when she was three, and her father passed away when she was 12. Eventually she was brought up by her Uncle Otto and Aunt Hulda. She was interested in acting from an early age. When she was 17, she attended the Royal Dramatic Theater School in Stockholm. She made her debut on the stage but was more interested in working in films. In the early 1940s, she gained star status in Hollywood, playing many roles as the heroine of the film. Bergman was considered to have tremendous acting talent, an angelic natural beauty and the willingness to work hard to get the best out of films. She was fluent in five languages and appeared in a range of films, plays and TV productions.",
		"Gordon Parks was a photographer, author, film director, and musician. He documented the everyday lives of African Americans at a time when few people outside the black community were familiar with their lives. Parks was born the youngest of 15 children and grew up on his family’s farm. After the death of his mother, he went to live with a sister in Minnesota. Parks eventually dropped out of school and worked at various jobs. His interest in photography was inspired by a photo­essay he read about migrant farm workers. After he moved to Chicago, Parks began taking photos of poor African Americans. In 1949, he became the first African American to be a staff photographer for Life magazine. He also wrote music pieces in his life and in 1956 the Vienna Orchestra performed a piano concerto he wrote. Parks was an inspiring artist until he died in 2006.  15명의 자녀 중 막내로 태어났다.",
		"The brothers Howard and Theodore Lydecker were responsible for the wonderful special effects in movie serials made by Republic Pictures from the 1930s to the 1950s. They specialized in creating extremely realistic effects on very low budgets. Among the qualities that made their effects so believable were carefully constructed models and an insistence that their effects be created “in camera.” This means that they were achieved during the original filming. Because the effects were shot simultaneously on the same film stock, the image quality was very high. The Lydeckers developed a technique for flying model aircraft that produced very realistic results. It gave them complete control over the movement of the aircraft and is still used today.",
		"Olaudah Equiano was born in the area that is now southern Nigeria. He was kidnapped with his younger sister at the age of 11, sold by local slave traders and shipped to the British colony of Virginia. He was bought by a Royal Navy officer, Michael Pascal. Equiano traveled the oceans with Pascal for eight years, during which time he learned to read and write. Later Equiano was sold to the prominent merchant Robert King. While working for him, Equiano earned money by trading on the side. In three years, with his master’s permission, Equiano bought his freedom for the price of 40 pounds. Equiano then spent much of the next 20 years traveling the world. Coming to London, he became involved in the movement to abolish slavery. In 1789 he published his autobiography, which became immensely popular and made Equiano a wealthy man. It depicts the horrors of slavery and influenced the establishment of the Slave Trade Act of 1807.",
		"The Icelandic horse is a breed of horse developed in Iceland. Although the horse is small, at times pony-sized, it’s a sturdy animal perfectly suited to the rough Icelandic terrain. The first horses were introduced by the early settlers and, since no other horses have been imported recently, the breeding stock remains pure. From the first years of settlement in Iceland to the early part of this century, these horses were the primary form of transportation in the country. Horsefights were organized as a source of entertainment and the meat was consumed as a staple. Even today the horse is still used for traditional farm work, as well as for leisure activities.",
		"Pocket gophers include several species that range across the western half of the United States. They prefer habitats where the earth is soft and easy to dig in, and they spend most of their time underground. As many as seven young are born in the spring. As soon as they are weaned, they dig burrows of their own and begin life alone. Mature gophers are 6-13 inches long and weigh up to a pound. Their bodies are fur covered except for a short thick tail. Gophers eat roots and other parts of plants they encounter while digging underground.",
		"Theodore von Kármán, a Hungarian­American engineer, was one of the greatest minds of the twentieth century. He was born in Hungary and at an early age, he showed a talent for math and science. In 1908, he received a doctoral degree in engineering at the University of Göttingen in Germany. In the 1920s, he began traveling as a lecturer and consultant to industry. He was invited to the United States to advise engineers on the design of a wind tunnel at California Institute of Technology (Caltech). He became the director of the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at Caltech in 1930. Later, he was awarded the National Medal of Science for his leadership in science and engineering.",
		"An American naturalist and marine biologist, William Beebe was born in 1877 in Brooklyn as the son of newspaper executive Charles Beebe, and although some sources have described William Beebe as an only child, he had a younger brother who died in infancy. During his high school years Beebe developed an interest in animals and published his first article about a bird known as a Brown Creeper. He attended Columbia University, but he never officially graduated. Beebe gradually developed an interest in marine biology and began to consider the possibility of diving with a deep-sea vessel to study marine creatures in their natural habitat. In 1928 he met an American deep-sea diver named Otis Barton, who had been working on a design for a deep diving sphere. After several test dives, in 1934 he and Barton made history with a record descent to 3,028 feet off the coast of Bermuda. In 1949, he founded a tropical research station in Trinidad and continued his research there until his death in 1962.",
		"Teak is among the most prized of the tropical hardwoods. It is native to India, Thailand, and Vietnam. It is a leaf­losing species that requires an annual dry season, so it is not found in the true rainforests. The wood of teak is particularly attractive, having a golden or reddish brown color. Teak is strong, making it a valued wood in shipbuilding and for high­quality furniture. One problem with harvesting teak is that the wood is very dense, so that when it is first felled and has not been dried it sinks in water. It cannot be moved out of forests by floating down rivers unless the wood has been dried first.",
		"The Gunnison Tunnel, constructed between 1905 and 1909, was designed to supply water to parts of western Colorado, diverting water from the Gunnison River to the Uncompahgre Valley around Montrose, Colorado. At the time of its completion, it was the longest irrigation tunnel in the world. Workers encountered a number of difficulties during the construction period, including soft ground and pockets of gas. Soft ground caused a sudden collapse that killed six workers in early 1905. Despite these obstacles, the tunnelers made good progress, achieving a record by cutting through 449 feet of granite in one month. President William Howard Taft conducted the opening on September 23, 1909, pressing the switch that released the first water. The completed tunnel, which is 30,583 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 10 feet deep at the sides, is still in operation.",
		"Thomas Nast was born on September 27, 1840, in Landau, Germany, and moved with his mother and sister to New York in 1846. Young Nast was a poor student—he never learned to read or write—but showed an early talent for drawing. When he was about 13 years old, he quit regular school and the next year he studied art with Theodore Kaufmann, a photographer and painter. In 1862 he joined the staff of Harper’s Weekly, where he focused his efforts on political cartoons. Nast made lasting contributions to the American political and cultural scene. He created the elephant as the symbol for the Republican Party and the modern version of Santa Claus. He also played an important role in the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1864.",
		"Born in 1895, Carol Ryrie Brink was orphaned by age 8 and raised by her grandmother. Her grandmother’s life and storytelling abilities inspired her writing. She married Raymond Woodard Brink, a young mathematics professor she had met in Moscow, Idaho many years before. After their son and daughter were born, early in her career, she started to write children’s stories and edited a yearly collection of short stories. She and her husband spent several years living in France, and her first novel Anything Can Happen on the River was published in 1934. After that, she wrote more than thirty fiction and nonfiction books for children and adults. She received the Newbery Award in 1936 for Caddie Woodlawn.",
		"The turkey vulture is the most widespread vulture in the Americas. It ranges from southern Canada to the southernmost tip of South America, inhabiting subtropical forests, pastures, and deserts. The turkey vulture feeds almost exclusively on dead animals. It finds its food using its keen eyes and sense of smell, flying low enough to detect the gases produced by decaying animal bodies. It nests in caves and hollow trees. Each year, it generally raises two chicks. It has very few natural predators, and has legal protection in the United States under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.",
		"Brooks Stevens was born in 1911 in Milwaukee. When he was struck down with polio at 8, his limbs stiffened and his right arm became virtually useless. Doctors predicted that he would not be able to walk again. Stevens’ father, however, was not a believer in bed rest. He piled sketchpads and model kits next to the boy’s bed and encouraged him to build miniature airplanes and boats. Stevens enrolled at Cornell University to study architecture but left Cornell without a diploma. Later, he returned to Milwaukee to work as an inventory manager. Bored and restless, he persuaded the head of his company to let him redesign some of the product labels. This opportunity was the first step towards Stevens’ career as an industrial designer. He opened his first office in 1935 and later created his own Auto Museum, which displayed both vehicles of his own design and those that he admired.",
		"Tarsiers are little primates not much bigger than rats. Their resemblance to the rat is exaggerated by their thin tail, which is much longer than their overall body length. All tarsiers are completely nocturnal and have a number of remarkable physical adaptations for this lifestyle. They have an excellent sense of hearing. Tarsiers also have enormous eyes in comparison with their body size; their eyes make up nearly one­fourth the size of their faces. The habitat of the tarsier is generally tropical rain forest and they are found in dense bamboo thickets. During the day, they lie in holes in tree trunks and in dark, thickly tangled vegetation. At night, they hunt for insects, spiders, and small lizards. Tarsiers can rotate their heads at least 180 degrees, which gives them a wide field of vision for spotting prey.",
		"Patricia Bath spent her life advocating for eye health. Born in 1942, she was raised in the Harlem area of New York City. She graduated from Howard University’s College of Medicine in 1968. It was during her time as a medical intern that she saw that many poor people and Black people were becoming blind because of the lack of eye care. She decided to concentrate on ophthalmology, which is the branch of medicine that works with eye diseases and disorders. As her career progressed, Bath taught students in medical schools and trained other doctors. In 1976, she co­founded the American Institute for the Prevention of Blindness (AiPB) with the basic principle that “eyesight is a basic human right.” In the 1980s, Bath began researching the use of lasers in eye treatments. Her research led to her becoming the first African­American female doctor to receive a patent for a medical device.",

		"John Bowlby, British developmental psychologist and psychiatrist, was born in 1907, to an upper-middle-class family. His father, who was a member of the King’s medical staff, was often absent. Bowlby was cared for primarily by a nanny and did not spend much time with his mother, as was customary at that time for his class. Bowlby was sent to a boarding school at the age of seven. He later recalled this as being traumatic to his development. This experience, however, proved to have a large impact on Bowlby, whose work focused on children’s development. Following his father’s suggestion, Bowlby enrolled at Trinity College, Cambridge to study medicine, but by his third year, he changed his focus to psychology. During the 1950s, Bowlby briefly worked as a mental health consultant for the World Health Organization. His attachment theory has been described as the dominant approach to understanding early social development.",
		"Xia Gui is known today as one of China’s greatest masters of landscape painting. He painted rapidly, using short and sharp strokes of the brush. Most of his landscapes were done in shades of black, but a few had light washes of color added to them. Xia was probably the official court painter to either the emperor Ningzong or the emperor Lizong. Together with his friend and fellow artist Ma Yuan, Xia founded the Ma-Xia school of painting. This group followed a tradition of very simple landscape painting, with little happening in the landscape and few details. By showing only selected features, such as mountain peaks and twisted trees, they aimed to create a feeling of unlimited space and quiet drama. The Ma-Xia school had a great influence on later artists.",
		"Maggie L.Walker achieved national prominence as a businesswoman and community leader. She was among the earliest Black students to attend newly-established public schools for African Americans. After graduating, she worked as a teacher for three years at the Valley School, where she had studied. In the early 1900s, Virginia banks owned by white bankers were unwilling to do business with African American organizations or individuals. The racial discrimination by white bankers drove her to study banking and financial laws. She established a newspaper to promote closer communication between the charitable organization she belonged to and the public. Soon after, she founded the St.Luke Penny Savings Bank, which survived the Great Depression and merged with two other banks. It thrived as the oldest continually African American-operated bank until 2009. Walker achieved successes with the vision to make improvements in the way of life for African Americans.",
		"The mallard is one of the most popular ducks among waterbird hunters and bird watchers. It’s commonly seen in ponds and lakes throughout Minnesota. It is most easily recognized by the male’s glossy green head and white neck collar. Mallards are very vocal; males have a low­pitched call, and hens use a loud, long series of quacks. In Minnesota, mallards mate in late winter or early spring. Nests are built in dense vegetation, and hens lay 5 to 14 eggs, which take 26 to 30 days to hatch. Interestingly, mallards swim with their tail held above the water, so when trouble comes, they can spring directly out of the water and into the air.",
		"Grant Wood grew up on a farm and drew with whatever materials could be spared. Often he used charcoal from the wood fire to sketch on a leftover piece of brown paper. He was only ten when his father died, and his mother moved the family to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where Wood went to school. He studied part­time at the State University of Iowa and attended night classes at the Art Institute of Chicago. When he was 32, he went to Paris to study at the Académie Julian. In 1927, he traveled to Munich, Germany, where some of the most accomplished artists of the period were working. While there, he saw German and Flemish artworks that influenced him greatly, especially the work of Jan van Eyck. After that trip, his style changed to reflect the realism of those painters.",
		"Carl‐Gustaf Rossby was one of a group of notable Scandinavian researchers who worked with the Norwegian meteorologist Vilhelm Bjerknes at the University of Bergen. While growing up in Stockholm, Rossby received a traditional education. He earned a degree in mathematical physics at the University of Stockholm in 1918, but after hearing a lecture by Bjerknes, and apparently bored with Stockholm, he moved to the newly established Geophysical Institute in Bergen. In 1925, Rossby received a scholarship from the Sweden‐America Foundation to go to the United States, where he joined the United States Weather Bureau. Based in part on his practical experience in weather forecasting, Rossby had become a supporter of the “polar front theory,” which explains the cyclonic circulation that develops at the boundary between warm and cold air masses. In 1947, Rossby accepted the chair of the Institute of Meteorology, which had been set up for him at the University of Stockholm, where he remained until his death ten years later.",
		"The monarch butterfly has lovely bright colors splashed on its wings. The wings have white spots on the outer margins. The hind wings are rounded, and they are lighter in color than the front wings. The body is black with white spots. The mother butterfly lays only one egg on the underside of milkweed leaves, which hatches about three to five days later. The monarch loves to fly around in the warm sunshine, from March through October, all across the United States. The monarch cannot survive the cold winter temperatures of the northern states. So, it very wisely migrates from the northern states to the south, and hibernates. The monarch is the only insect that can fly more than four thousand kilometers to a warmer climate.",
		"Victor Frankl, a famous psychiatrist, remained head of the neurology department at the Vienna Policlinic Hospital for twenty­five years. He wrote more than thirty books for both professionals and general readers. He met with politicians, world leaders such as Pope Paul VI, philosophers, students, teachers, and numerous individuals who had read and been inspired by his books. He lectured widely in Europe, the Americas, Australia, Asia, and Africa; and held professorships at Harvard, Stanford, and the University of Pittsburgh. Even in his nineties, Frankl continued to engage in dialogue with visitors from all over the world and to respond personally to some of the hundreds of letters he received every week. Twenty­nine universities awarded him honorary degrees, and the American Psychiatric Association honored him with the Oskar Pfister Award.",
		"Dutch mathematician and astronomer Christiaan Huygens was born in The Hague in 1629. He studied law and mathematics at his university, and then devoted some time to his own research, initially in mathematics but then also in optics, working on telescopes and grinding his own lenses. Huygens visited England several times, and met Isaac Newton in 1689. In addition to his work on light, Huygens had studied forces and motion, but he did not accept Newton’s law of universal gravitation. Huygens’ wide­ranging achievements included some of the most accurate clocks of his time, the result of his work on pendulums. His astronomical work, carried out using his own telescopes, included the discovery of Titan, the largest of Saturn’s moons, and the first correct description of Saturn’s rings.",
		"Born in 1627 in Black Notley, Essex, England, John Ray was the son of the village blacksmith. At 16, he went to Cambridge University, where he studied widely and lectured on topics from Greek to mathematics, before joining the priesthood in 1660. To recover from an illness in 1650, he had taken to nature walks and developed an interest in botany. Accompanied by his wealthy student and supporter Francis Willughby, Ray toured Britain and Europe in the 1660s, studying and collecting plants and animals. He married Margaret Oakley in 1673 and, after leaving Willughby’s household, lived quietly in Black Notley to the age of 77. He spent his later years studying samples in order to assemble plant and animal catalogues. He wrote more than twenty works on theology and his travels, as well as on plants and their form and function.",
		"The impala is one of the most graceful four‒legged animals. Impalas have the ability to adapt to different environments of the savannas. Both male and female impalas are similar in color, with white bellies and black‒tipped ears. Male impalas have long and pointed horns which can measure 90 centimeters in length. Female impalas have no horns. Impalas feed upon grass, fruits, and leaves from trees. When conditions are harsh in the dry season, they come together to search for food in mixed herds which can number as many as 100-200 individuals. The breeding season occurs at the end of the wet season around May. Females give birth in an isolated spot away from the herd. The average life span of an impala is between 13 and 15 years in the wild.",
		"Born in 1917, Cleveland Amory was an author, an animal advocate, and an animal rescuer. During his childhood, he had a great affection for his aunt Lucy, who was instrumental in helping Amory get his first puppy as a child, an event that Amory remembered seventy years later as the most memorable moment of his childhood. He graduated from Harvard College in 1939 and later became the youngest editor ever hired by The Saturday Evening Post. Amory wrote three instant best­selling books, including The Best Cat Ever, based on his love of animals. He founded The Fund for Animals in 1967, and he served as its president, without pay, until his death in 1998. He always dreamed of a place where animals could roam free and live in caring conditions. Inspired by Anna Sewell’s novel Black Beauty, Amory established Black Beauty Ranch, a 1,460­acre area that shelters various abused animals including chimpanzees and elephants. Today, a stone monument to Amory stands at Black Beauty Ranch.",
		"Camille Flammarion was born at Montigny­le­Roi, France. He became interested in astronomy at an early age, and when he was only sixteen he wrote a book on the origin of the world. The manuscript was not published at the time, but it came to the attention of Urbain Le Verrier, the director of the Paris Observatory. He became an assistant to Le Verrier in 1858 and worked as a calculator. At nineteen, he wrote another book called The Plurality of Inhabited Worlds, in which he passionately claimed that life exists outside the planet Earth. His most successful work, Popular Astronomy, was published in 1880, and eventually sold 130,000 copies. With his own funds, he built an observatory at Juvisy and spent May to November of each year there. In 1887, he founded the French Astronomical Society and served as editor of its monthly publication.",
		"Ole Bull was born in Bergen, Norway, in 1810. He was a violinist and composer known for his unique performance method. His father wished for him to become a minister of the church, but he desired a musical career. At the age of five, he could play all of the songs he had heard his mother play on the violin. At age nine, he played first violin in the orchestra of Bergen’s theater. His debut as a soloist came in 1819, and by 1828 he was made conductor of the Musical Lyceum. He is believed to have composed more than 70 works, but only about 10 remain today. In 1850, caught up in a rising tide of Norwegian romantic nationalism, Bull co­founded the first theater in which actors performed in Norwegian rather than Danish. Bull died from cancer in his home in 1880. He had held his last concert in Chicago the same year, despite his illness.",
		"Janaki Ammal, one of India’s most notable scientists, was born in 1897, and was expected to wed through an arranged marriage. Despite living at a time when literacy among women in India was less than one percent, she decided to reject tradition and attend college. In 1924, she went to the U.S. and eventually received a doctorate in botany from the University of Michigan. Ammal contributed to the development of the sweetest sugarcane variety in the world. She moved to England where she co-authored the Chromosome Atlas of Cultivated Plants. Following a series of famines, she returned to India to help increase food production at the request of the Prime Minister. However, Ammal disagreed with the deforestation taking place in an effort to grow more food. She became an advocate for the preservation of native plants and successfully saved the Silent Valley from the construction of a hydroelectric dam.",
		"Francis Crick, the Nobel Prize-winning codiscoverer of the structure of the DNA molecule, was born in Northampton, England in 1916. He attended University College London, where he studied physics, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1937. He soon began conducting research toward a Ph.D., but his path was interrupted by the outbreak of World War . During the war, he was involved in naval weapons research, working on the development of magnetic and acoustic mines. After the war, Dr. R. V. Jones, the head of Britains wartime scientific intelligence, asked Crick to continue the work, but Crick decided to continue his studies, this time in biology. In 1951, Crick met James Watson, a young American biologist, at the Strangeways Research Laboratory. They formed a collaborative working relationship solving the mysteries of the structure of DNA.",
		"San Miniato is a town of about 26,000 that sits atop three hills in the Arno river valley in Tuscany, Italy. The town’s history is deeply rooted in its function as an important stop along the trading route between France and Italy. To protect its historic building character, the city has set detailed criteria for the installation of signs, plaques, and posters and has revised its street signs. To protect views of the town and to limit visual intrusions, the city has made strict regulations about the construction of cell phone towers. To accommodate visitors and tourists and not intrude on the urban layout and design, the town has built an underground parking lot with an elevator to the city center.",
		"During her childhood years, the artist Tammy Rahr spent a lot of time outdoors making things from flowers and dirt. Then Tammy and her family moved from the woodlands of New York State to an urban city outside of Los Angeles, California. The experience made her more aware of what was going on in the world. After returning to New York State with her family, Tammy faced another lesson in growing up. A gifted student, she was sent to college when she was just 14. Tammy was able to earn her high school diploma and some college credit before trying her hand at a number of different jobs. Eventually, she moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, and studied at the Institute of American Indian Arts. After graduating from the institute, she remained active with it and the museum there.",
		"The blue sea slug is a strange­looking marine creature found in the temperate and tropical waters of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. With the aid of a gas­filled sac in its stomach, the blue sea slug floats at the surface. Due to the location of the gas sac, the blue sea slug floats upside down. They live a pelagic life―this means they go where the winds and currents take them. Blue sea slugs feed mainly on hydrozoans although they are also known to eat the flesh of their own kind. One of the specialities of their diet is the highly poisonous Portuguese Man­O­War. The blue sea slug can not only swallow its prey’s stinging cells without hurting itself, but also store the swallowed poison inside the up to 84 finger­like structures sticking out of its body, and then use this poison to defend itself against other predators. The blue sea slug is a hermaphrodite, having both male and female reproductive organs.",
		"Living rock cactus is one of the most peculiar plants found in the desert. For most of the year, it blends into the rocky limestone soils of the Dead Horse Mountains, Mariscal Mountain, and the hills along the Rio Grande. You may step on one before you notice it. Spineless and flat against the ground, it has triangular tubercles that overlap in a star-shaped pattern. In extremely dry conditions, living rock cactus is almost invisible: it literally shrinks into the surrounding rocky soil. Moisture is stored in the root, and during droughts the root shrinks, dragging the stem underground. These spineless plants survive by blending into their native habitat. As added protection, they store foul-tasting, poisonous alkaloids in their bodies.",
		"Whether in flower or in fruit, coral bean is one of the most striking plants in the American Southwest. Much of the year, however, the leafless brown stems are scarcely noticeable in their rocky hillside habitat. In June, clusters of red flowers sprout from the stem tips, attracting hummingbirds. Leaves appear once the summer rains start, usually in July. Coral bean plants are most noticeable in the autumn when their leaves have turned golden and the brown pods reveal the (occasionally light brown) seeds. Alkaloids make coral bean seeds highly toxic. In the Southwest, winter temperatures prevent coral bean from growing much taller than three feet, but in the frost­free parts of northern Mexico, it is a small tree up to twenty feet tall.",
		"In 1995, Derek Parra was the best inline skater in the world, with eighteen world titles to his credit and a projection of many more to come. He was the king of his domain. However, there was a problem. Inline skating isn’t included in the Olympics and Parra dreamed of winning an Olympic gold medal. So, at the age of twenty­five, he switched to the sport of speedskating, a cousin of inline skating but with two important differences: you race on skates instead of wheels and on ice instead of asphalt. There was nothing easy about the switch. Parra had grown up in southern California and had hardly ever seen any ice, let alone spent any time on it. Overnight, he went from being No. 1 in the world to just somebody in the back of the pack. However, he stuck to his goals and persisted in making the transition, and in the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, he won his Olympic gold medal.",
		"James Gibbs is best known for his successful blending of Renaissance and Baroque architectural elements into an early-18th century Neo-Classicism. He was born in Scotland and studied in Rome under the Late Baroque Italian architect Carlo Fontana. Returning to England in 1709, he was appointed a member of the commission authorized to build 50 churches in London. Between 1722 and 1726 Gibbs constructed his most famous church, Saint Martin-in-the-Fields, which has a spire rather than a dome rising from the roof of the building. Of Gibbs’ later works the circular ‘Radcliffe Camera’ library at Oxford University is his most ambitious and monumental achievement. His architectural style has influenced the architecture of churches in England and the United States.",
		"Jeannette Rankin was born in Missoula, Montana in 1880. After attending public schools in Missoula, Jeannette majored in biology at the University of Montana and graduated in 1902. Jeannette became the first woman elected to the U.S. Congress in 1916, before women nationwide had the right to vote. In 1917, she became one of 49 members of Congress who voted against entry into World War I. In 1941, she was the only legislator to vote against entry into World War II. The vote effectively ended her political career. In 1943, Jeannette went back to Montana rather than run for Congress again. She traveled worldwide, including to India and Turkey, promoting peace. Her long career was distinguished by her deep commitment to the country’s women, poor, and children. She continued to participate in antiwar movements actively by attending rallies and giving speeches into her 90’s.",
		"Richard Porson, one of Britain’s most notable classical scholars, was born on Christmas in 1759. His talents were recognized early, and he was sent to Eton College by wealthy sponsors at 15. Four years later, he entered Cambridge University. He significantly improved Greek texts and edited four plays written by Euripides. In 1806, he was elected Principal Librarian at the newly founded London Institution. During his lifetime, he collected a great many books on classical literature. Although the number of books he owned in total is simply unknown, an episode about his passion for books is well-known: he carried so many books that he was able to pull book after book out of his pocket when a student tried to show off his knowledge of Greek writers. Despite his fame as a classical scholar, he actually published little. On September 25, 1808, three months before reaching age 49, Porson died.",
		"Allan Houser created contemporary Apache sculpture. As a child, he listened to his father’s stories about the adventures of Chief Geronimo. This gave him a deep attachment to his ancestral background, an attachment that is shown in his artwork. Houser studied at the Indian School in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and then remained in Santa Fe, where he worked as a freelance artist. During World War II, he traveled to California, where he became interested in the media of sculpture. He created works in a variety of styles and mastered bronze, metal, and stone sculpture. Houser’s designs are modern, yet firmly rooted in the special tradition of his Native American forefathers. He drew inspiration from both past and present, but like all successful artists, his sculpture transcends race and language. The sculpture Reverie shows a distinct Native American influence, but it can be appreciated by anyone, regardless of his or her background.",
		"Maria Mitchell was born on August 1, 1818, in Nantucket, Massachusetts. Her awareness for astronomy came to life when her father began to teach her about the stars with the use of his own telescope. At twelve, she aided her father in calculating the exact moment of an annular eclipse. And at seventeen, she opened her very own school for girls, where she taught them science and math. Mitchell rocketed to the forefront of American astronomy when she spotted a comet through her telescope. For her discovery of the comet, she received a gold medal as a recognition from King Frederick VII of Denmark. This gave her worldwide fame, since the only previous women to discover a comet were the astronomers Caroline Herschel and Maria Margarethe Kirch. In 1865 Mitchell became a faculty member at Vassar College, making her the first female astronomy professor in the United States.",
		"North Yungas Road, known as ‘Death Road,’ connects the Yungas region of northern Bolivia to the capital, La Paz. The road was built in the 1930s during the Chaco War by Paraguayan prisoners of war. Starting from La Paz, this road first climbs to 4,650 meters, and then gradually descends to 1,200 meters at the town of Coroico. This drop is one of the longest stretches of continuous downhill road in the world. It’s mostly a single-lane road with no guard rails, and it has cliffs of up to 600 meters. The hazards include landslides and tumbling rocks, constant fog, tropical downpours and limited visibility. Unlike the rest of Bolivia, one of the local road rules specifies that vehicles are required to drive on the left side of the road to give the driver a better view of the vehicle’s outside wheel and make passing safer.",
		"Sequoyah, a Cherokee Indian, was born in about 1770 in Taskigi, now in Tennessee. Raised by his Cherokee mother, the young Sequoyah never learned to read or write English. While interacting with English speakers, he realized the necessity of a writing system for the Cherokee people. In about 1809, Sequoyah began developing a system of writing, adapting letters from English, Greek, and Hebrew. By 1821, he had created a system of 86 symbols, representing all the syllables of the Cherokee language. The Cherokee people began to use the system in their schools and publish books and newspapers in their language. In 1824, the General Council of the Eastern Cherokees awarded Sequoyah a medal in honor of his accomplishment. Sequoyah moved to Oklahoma some years later and died in what is now Texas in 1843. And later, people remembered him by naming a certain tree species “Sequoia.”",
		"Robert Hooke was born on July 18, 1635 on the Isle of Wight, England. He entered Westminster School at the age of thirteen, and from there went to Oxford, where some of the best scientists in England were working at the time. Hooke impressed them with his skills at designing experiments and building equipment, and soon became an assistant to the chemist Robert Boyle. Hooke worked with Boyle for seven years. Hooke devised a compound microscope with a new, screw­operated focusing mechanism he designed. In 1665 Hooke wrote Micrographia, a book describing observations made with microscopes and telescopes, which was a big bestseller at that time. He was the one who first used the term “cell” for describing biological organisms. He died in London on March 3, 1703.",
		"The !Kung San, also known as the Bushmen, live in the Kalahari Desert in southern Africa. The “!K” in the name “!Kung” is like the sound that occurs when a cork is pulled from a bottle. Traditionally, they lived by hunting and gathering, the way of life that was the universal mode of human existence until 10,000 years ago. The total population of the !Kung San in 1986 was about 15,000, with most of them living in nonhunting and gathering situations on cattleposts or farms. The !Kung San in the Dobe area of Botswana were divided into twenty five groups with a mean size of eighteen to twenty people. The !Kung San in that area had abundant food supply and a lot of leisure time. The main food crop was the wild mongongo nut, millions of which were harvested every year.",
		"The barn owl is a medium­sized owl with a heart­shaped face. The females are sometimes 30-55 grams heavier than the males and usually darker and more heavily spotted. Notable is the near absence of obvious dark markings on the underside of the flight and tail feathers. The white legs of barn owls are feathered nearly to the base of their gray­brown toes; their long needle­sharp claws are dark gray. The barn owl gives a loud screeching sound, sometimes with a tremulous effect, often described as shrrreeee. In Britain, the owl’s cry gave this owl the name ‘Screech Owl’ in 1666, but as early as 1678 it was changed to ‘Barn Owl.’ This owl is rather common and widely distributed from Central Europe to Africa and Southeast Asia. In England and Wales the population was approximately 12,000 pairs in 1932, but numbers there have decreased in the last fifty years by almost 70 percent.",
		"Award­winning author A. Manette Ansay was born in Michigan in 1964, and grew up in Wisconsin. She was talented at playing the piano when young and subsequently trained as a concert pianist, attending the Peabody Conservatory of Music. However, by the age of 21 she had to give up the pursuit because of ill health, and by 23 she began writing in need of another outlet for her creative energies. Since then, she has become a best­selling novelist. After her time at Peabody, she worked for a while at the American Museum of Natural History before returning to school at the University of Maine to study anthropology. Since the 1990s, her health has gradually stabilized, though there are still times when even writing is challenging. Ansay went on to study and work at Cornell University, and then became an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University.",
		"Frank Lloyd Wright was born on June 8, 1867 in Wisconsin. During his childhood, Wright fell in love with the rolling landscape. This inspired him as an architect to incorporate a more organic feel into his buildings. While in college, Wright worked with an architect in order to pay his tuition. Upon discovering his own passion and talent for the subject, he dropped out of school and went to work for an architectural firm in Chicago. He eventually parted ways with the firm and began designing a series of public buildings and private residences that earned him fame, including an earthquake-proof hotel in Tokyo. Due to the Great Depression, Lloyd stepped back from designing and began writing and teaching. Later, he returned to the scene and designed one of his most famous buildings, Fallingwater, which was built on top of a waterfall. Time cited it after its completion as Wright’s “most beautiful job.”",
		"Born into a working-class family in 1872, Albert C. Barnes grew up in Philadelphia. He became interested in art when he became friends with future artist William Glackens in high school. He earned a medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania and qualified as a doctor in 1892. Barnes decided not to work as a doctor, and after further study he entered the business world. In 1901, he invented the antiseptic Argyrol with a German chemist and made a fortune. Using his wealth, he began purchasing hundreds of paintings. In 1922, he established the Barnes Foundation to promote the education of fine arts. There he displayed his huge collection without detailed explanation. He died in a car accident in 1951.",
		"Charles Richard Drew was born in 1904 in Washington, D.C. Drew graduated from McGill University Medical School in Montreal, Canada, ranking second in a class of 137. Drew did graduate work and earned his doctorate of medical science from Columbia University. Drew’s research led to the discovery that blood plasma could replace whole blood in transfusions. He set up and administered the British blood bank from 1940 to 1941, and also served as medical director of the American Red Cross project to collect and store blood in 1941. Drew was dropped from the American Red Cross project because he objected to the policy of refusing the blood of black donors. He asserted that there was no scientific difference between the blood of blacks and whites. In 1950, he was seriously injured in a car accident in Alabama and died from having lost too much blood.",
		"The brown tree snake has a large head with sticking-out eyes. The head is distinct from the narrow neck. Its body usually has a light brown background with a series of darker markings or bands on it. The snake is about 38 centimeters when it comes out of its egg, and usually reaches 1 to 2 meters long. This snake is infamous for causing the extinction of the majority of native bird species in Guam. Shortly after World War Ⅱ, the brown tree snake was accidentally brought into Guam from its native range in the South Pacific, probably as an unwanted passenger on a ship or plane. It is not hunted or eaten by any other animals in Guam and is therefore at the top of its food chain, which has led the snake to increase dramatically in number.",
		"Nicolas Appert was born in Châlons­sur­Marne, on the edge of France’s Champagne region, in 1749. He became an accomplished chef and served in the kitchens of various noblemen before setting up as a confectioner in Paris in 1781. In this line of work he was necessarily aware of the use of sugar to preserve fruit, and he wondered whether it could be used to preserve other foods. As his interest in food preservation grew he began to experiment with storing food in sealed champagne bottles. In 1795 he moved to the village of Ivry­sur­Seine, where he began to offer preserved foods for sale, and in 1804 he set up a small factory to produce them. By this time some of his preserved food had been tested by the French navy, which was impressed by its quality. Appert had devised his methods solely by experiment and had no idea why it worked.",
		"Jacqueline Cochran was raised by foster parents in a poor town in Florida. When she was about eight years old, the family moved to Columbus, Georgia, where she worked 12 hours a day in a factory. Her formal education lasted only two years; she learned to read and write on her own. In 1932 she met her future husband, Floyd Odlum, who encouraged her to learn to fly. Cochran loved flying and participated in many air races. Before World War II, she volunteered her services to the Royal Air Force. She recruited qualified women pilots in the United States and took them to England where they joined the air force. After the war, Cochran set more than 200 flight records in her career. In 1953, she became the first woman pilot to break the sound barrier. Additionally, she was the first female to pilot a jet across the Atlantic.",
		"Maurice Maeterlinck, the greatest symbolist playwright of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, was born on August 29, 1862, in Ghent, Belgium. He studied law and worked as a lawyer until 1889, when he decided to devote himself to writing. In 1897, Maeterlinck went to Paris, where he met many of the leading symbolist writers of the day. His first play, La Princesse Maleine (The Princess Maleine), was sent to major French symbolist poet and critic Mallarmé and became an immediate success. Another of his plays, L’Oiseau bleu (The Blue Bird), was an international success and has been adapted several times as a children’s book and a major motion picture. The phrase “the bluebird of happiness” derives from this enormously popular and enduring story. Maeterlinck won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1911. He died of a heart attack on May 6, 1949, in Nice, France.",

Burton was the first member of his family to go to secondary school. Then, he attended Oxford University and later joined the British air force during wartime. After leaving the military in 1947, he made his film debut in 1949, in The Last Days of Dolwyn. Richard Burton went on to become a praised actor of stage and screen, who was nominated for an Academy Award seven times, but never won an Oscar. It is well-known that he had a powerful voice overwhelming the camera, the microphone, and all the intimacy of film acting. His final film was an adaptation of George Orwell’s famous novel, 1984.",
		"The saola, also known as the Vu Quong ox, is an endangered, nocturnal forest­dwelling ox weighing about 100 kilograms. Its habitat is the dense mountain forests in the Annamite Mountains, which run through the Lao PDR and Vietnam. The saola is generally considered the greatest animal discovery of recent times. First documented in Vietnam in 1992, it is so different from any other known species that a separate genus had to be created for it. The saola stays at higher elevations during the wetter summer season, when streams at these altitudes have plenty of water, and moves down to the lowlands in winter, when the mountain streams dry up. They are said to travel mostly in groups of two or three animals. Hunting and the loss of forest habitat due to logging and conversion to farmland threaten its survival.",
		"Charles H. Townes, one of the most influential American physicists, was born in South Carolina. In his childhood, he grew up on a farm, studying the stars in the sky. He earned his doctoral degree from the California Institute of Technology in 1939, and then he took a job at Bell Labs in New York City. After World War II, he became an associate professor of physics at Columbia University. In 1958, Townes and his co-researcher proposed the concept of the laser. Laser technology won quick acceptance in industry and research. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1964. He was also involved in Project Apollo, the moon landing project. His contribution is priceless because the Internet and all digital media would be unimaginable without the laser.",
		"Victor Borge, born in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1909, was a comedian and pianist. Initially a concert musician, Victor Borge soon developed a performance style that combined comedy with classical music. When the Nazis invaded Denmark in 1940, he was performing in Sweden, and a short time later managed to escape to America. When he arrived in the U.S., he didn’t speak a word of English. Learning English by watching movies, he soon managed to translate his jokes for the American audience. In 1948, Victor Borge became an American citizen and a few years later was offered a show of his own, Comedy in Music. The show remains the longest-running one-man show in Broadway history.

After being denied several times, she was accepted into a training program in anesthesiology. As Apgar studied, she became interested in the way anesthesia given to mothers in labor affected babies. During this time, she developed the Apgar score, which is a method of checking the health of a newborn. According to the method, doctors must consider five different factors, including heart rate and breathing effort, when they inspect babies. She received many awards including an honorary doctorate from the Women’s Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1964.

		"The Nuer are one of the largest ethnic groups in South Sudan, primarily residing in the Nile River Valley. The Nuer are a cattle-raising people, whose everyday lives revolve around their cattle. They have various terms related to cattle, so they can distinguish between hundreds of types of cows, based on color, markings, and shape of horns. They prefer to be called by the names of the cattle they raise. The commonest daily foods for the Nuer are dairy products, especially milk for the young and soured milk, like yogurt, for adults. And wild fruits and nuts are favorite snacks for the Nuer. The Nuer also have a culture of counting only older members of the family. They believe that counting the number of children one has could result in misfortune and prefer to report fewer children than they have.",
		"Born in Lancashire, England, in 1871, William McDougall left his mark on experimental and physiological psychology. After receiving a degree in natural sciences in Cambridge University, he became interested in human behavior. He believed human behavior to be based on three abilities― intellect, emotion, and will. Being a hardworking scholar, he held academic positions in several universities in England. He also wrote many books on psychology including the well-known Introduction to Social Psychology. In 1920, he published The Group Mind opposing mechanistic interpretations of human behavior. However, The Group Mind was poorly received when published. Somewhat disappointed, he moved to the United States in the same year to be a professor at Harvard University. Seven years later, he moved to Duke University, where he developed a psychology department and continued various research. Today many people read his books, and psychologists celebrate his intellectual achievements.",

When Czechoslovakia was invaded by the Nazis, he was forced to flee to Scandinavia, and went from there to the United States in 1941. In 1943 he became one of the founding members of the Linguistic Circle of New York and acted as its vice president until 1949. He taught at numerous institutions from 1943 on, including Harvard University and MIT. Through his teaching in the United States, Jakobson helped to bridge the gap between European and American linguistics. Known as the father of modern structural linguistics, he elaborated sophisticated theories of language and communication that have had significant effects on such disciplines as anthropology, art criticism, and brain research.",
		"Herbert Shelton was born on October 6, 1895 in Wylie, Texas. As a child, Shelton took an interest in animals, especially their habits when sick as compared to when well. Shelton attended Bernarr Macfadden’s College of Physcultopathy in Chicago and interned at Crane’s Sanatorium in Elmhurst, Illinois. In 1921, he graduated from the American School of Naturopathy with a Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine. Shelton claimed that cooking food denatures it, and that a healthy body has the ability to restore itself from illness without medical intervention. Although heavily criticized by his contemporaries for advocating fasting over medical treatment, Shelton’s work served as an early influence for the raw food movement. A pacifist, Shelton was jailed in 1917 for making an anti­draft statement in public during the height of World War I. By 1972, at the age of 77, Shelton became bedridden from Parkinson’s disease. He died thirteen years later.",
		"Ilya Prigogine was born into a Jewish family in Moscow. In 1921, he and his family left Russia, eventually settling in Belgium. His parents encouraged him to become a lawyer, and he first studied law at the Free University of Brussels. It was then that he became interested in psychology and behavioral research. In turn, reading about these subjects sparked his interest in chemistry since chemical processes affect the mind and body. He eventually dropped out of law school. Prigogine then studied chemistry and physics at the same time at the Free University of Brussels. He obtained the equivalent of a master’s degree in both fields in 1939, and he obtained a PhD in chemistry in 1941 at the Free University of Brussels, where he accepted the position of professor in 1947. Considered one of the founders of complexity science, Ilya Prigogine was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1977.",
		"Donald Griffin was an American biophysicist and animal behaviourist known for his research in animal navigation, acoustic orientation, and sensory biophysics. During his childhood, he was influenced by his uncle, who was a Harvard professor of biology. Griffin received a Ph.D. in zoology from Harvard University in 1942. He demonstrated that bats emit high-frequency sounds with which they can locate objects as small as flying insects. In 1965, he became a professor at Rockefeller University in New York and a research zoologist for the New York Zoological Society. After he retired from Rockefeller University in 1986, he didn’t stop his research: he continued to present papers at national and international meetings. In the late 1970s Griffin argued that animals might possess the ability to think and reason. Although his claim sparked much controversy in the science community, there is no question that he radically opened up the field of animal cognition.",
		"Ann Bancroft was born in Minnesota, U.S. Bancroft grew up in rural Minnesota in what she described as a family of risk­takers. Although she struggled with a learning disability, she graduated from St. Paul Academy and became a physical education teacher. Bancroft resigned her teaching position in 1986 in order to participate in the Will Steger International Polar Expedition. The group departed from Ellesmere Island on March 6, and after 56 days, she and five other team members arrived at the North Pole by dogsled. She thus became the first woman to reach the North Pole by sled and on foot. In November 1992, she led three other women on the American Women’s Expedition to Antarctica. It took them 67 days to reach the South Pole on skis and Bancroft became the first woman to have stood at both poles.",
		"Emil Zátopek, a former Czech athlete, is considered one of the greatest long-distance runners ever. He was also famous for his distinctive running style. While working in a shoe factory, he participated in a 1,500-meter race and won second place. After that event, he took a more serious interest in running and devoted himself to it. At the 1952 Olympic Games in Helsinki, he won three gold medals in the 5,000-meter and 10,000-meter races and in the marathon, breaking Olympic records in each. He was married to Dana Zátopková, who was an Olympic gold medalist, too. Zátopek was also noted for his friendly personality. In 1966, Zátopek invited Ron Clarke, a great Australian runner who had never won an Olympic gold medal, to an athletic meeting in Prague. After the meeting, he gave Clarke one of his gold medals as a gift.",
		"Charles Rosen, a virtuoso pianist and distinguished writer, was born in New York in 1927. Rosen displayed a remarkable talent for the piano from his early childhood. In 1951, the year he earned his doctoral degree in French literature at Princeton University, Rosen made both his New York piano debut and his first recordings. To glowing praise, he appeared in numerous recitals and orchestral concerts around the world. Rosen’s performances impressed some of the 20th century’s most well-known composers, who invited him to play their music. Rosen was also the author of many widely admired books about music. His most famous book, The Classical Style, was first published in 1971 and won the U.S. National Book Award the next year. This work, which was reprinted in an expanded edition in 1997, remains a landmark in the field. While writing extensively, Rosen continued to perform as a pianist for the rest of his life until he died in 2012.",
		"Waldemar Haffkine was born on the 16th of March 1860 at Odessa in Russia. He graduated in the Science Faculty of Odessa University in 1884. In 1889, Haffkine went to Paris to work at the Pasteur Institute, and did research to prepare a vaccine against cholera. His initial work on developing a cholera vaccine was successful. After a series of animal trials, in 1892 he tested the cholera vaccine on himself, risking his own life. During the Indian cholera epidemic of 1893, at the invitation of the Government of India he went to Calcutta and introduced his vaccine. After initial criticism by the local medical bodies, it was widely accepted. Haffkine was appointed as the director of the Plague Laboratory in Bombay (now called the Haffkine Institute). After his retirement in 1914, he returned to France and occasionally wrote for medical journals. He revisited Odessa in 1927, but could not adapt to the tremendous changes after the revolution in the country of his birth. He moved to Switzerland in 1928 and remained there for the last two years of his life.",
		"Anna May Wong is considered the first Chinese­American movie star in Hollywood. She dropped out of high school to pursue a full­time acting career and, at 17, she played her first leading role in The Toll of the Sea. Reviewers praised her extraordinary acting but her ethnicity prevented U.S. filmmakers from casting her as a leading lady. Frustrated, Wong left for Europe in 1928, where she had main roles in many notable films. When American studios wanted fresh European talent in the 1930s, Wong’s new prestige immediately led to a main role on Broadway. She returned to America and used her influence to advocate for better film opportunities for Chinese­Americans. In 1938, she sold her movie costumes and donated the money from the sale to organizations supporting Chinese refugees. During World War II, she gave political speeches against the anti­Asian attitudes in the U.S. In 2022, she became the first Asian American to appear on U.S. currency―a century after she landed her first leading role.",
		"Henry Moore (1898—1986), one of the most significant British artists of the 20th century, was the seventh child of a coal miner. Henry Moore showed a talent for art from early on in school. After World War I, during which he volunteered for army service, Moore began to study sculpture at the Leeds School of Art. Then, he entered the Royal College of Art in London and earned his degree there. His sculptures, known around the world, present the forms of the body in a unique way. One of his artistic themes was mother-and-child as shown in Madonna and Child at St. Matthew’s Church in Northampton. He achieved financial success from his hard work and established the Henry Moore Foundation to support education and promotion of the arts.",
		"Josef Sudek was born in the Czech Republic. Originally a bookbinder, Sudek was badly injured during World War I, resulting in the loss of his right arm. After the injury, he spent three years in various hospitals, and began to take photographs out of boredom. In 1922, he enrolled at the State School of Graphic Arts in Prague, where he studied photography for two years. His army disability pension allowed him to make art without worrying about an income. He photographed many night‑scapes of Prague and the wooded landscapes of Bohemia. Sudek didn’t let his disability get in the way and, despite having only one arm, he used very heavy and bulky equipment. Often known as the ‘Poet of Prague,’ Sudek never married, and was a shy and retiring person. He never appeared at his exhibition openings. He died on 15 September 1976, when he was 80 years old.",
		"Antonia Brico was born in the Netherlands in 1902 and immigrated to the United States at the age of six. After attending a park concert when she was young, she was so inspired that she made up her mind to study music and become a conductor. In 1927, she entered the Berlin State Academy of Music and became the first American to graduate from its master class in conducting. In 1930, Brico made her debut as a professional conductor, for which she received positive reviews. She made an extensive European tour, and during the tour she was invited by Jean Sibelius to conduct the Helsinki Symphony Orchestra. Brico settled in Denver, where she continued to work as a conductor of the Denver Businessmen’s Orchestra, later renamed the Brico Symphony Orchestra. In 1974, her most famous student, folk singer Judy Collins, made a documentary film about her, which was nominated for an Academy Award.",
		"William Buckland (1784—1856) was well known as one of the greatest geologists in his time. His birthplace, Axminster in Britain, was rich with fossils, and as a child, he naturally became interested in fossils while collecting them. In 1801, Buckland won a scholarship and was admitted to Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He developed his scientific knowledge there while attending John Kidd’s lectures on mineralogy and chemistry. After Kidd resigned his position, Buckland was appointed his successor at the college. Buckland used representative samples and large-scale geological maps in his lectures, which made his lectures more lively. In 1824, he announced the discovery of the bones of a giant creature, and he named it Megalosaurus, or ‘great lizard’. He won the prize from the Geological Society due to his achievements in geology.",
		"Eric Carle was an American writer and illustrator of children’s literature. Born in Syracuse, New York, in 1929, he moved with his parents to Germany when he was six years old. He was educated there, and graduated from an art school in Stuttgart, Germany. He moved back to the United States and worked as a graphic designer at The New York Times. In the mid­1960s, children’s author Bill Martin Jr. asked Carle to illustrate a book he was writing. In 1967, they published their first collaboration: Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? His best­known work, The Very Hungry Caterpillar, has been translated into more than 66 languages and sold over 50 million copies. In 2002, Carle and his wife opened the Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art, which collects and features the work of children’s book illustrators from around the world.",
		"Leon Festinger was an American social psychologist. He was born in New York City in 1919 to a Russian immigrant family. As a graduate student at the University of Iowa, Festinger was influenced by Kurt Lewin, a leading social psychologist. After graduating from there, he became a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1945. He later moved to Stanford University, where he continued his work in social psychology. His theory of social comparison earned him a good reputation. Festinger actively participated in international scholarly cooperation. In the late 1970s, he turned his interest to the field of history. He was one of the most cited psychologists of the twentieth century. Festinger’s theories still play an important role in psychology today.",
		"Gilbert Stuart grew up in the American colony of Rhode Island before the United States was an independent nation. He traveled to Scotland, England, and Ireland to study art. He then returned to America about the time the war for independence broke out, but he returned to Europe once again because the war made his career as an artist difficult. Even so, he didn’t find much success until he came back to the United States in 1795, when he painted a portrait of George Washington. Stuart is called the “father of American portraiture” because he painted pictures of all the famous people of early America. One of his paintings of George Washington was hung in the White House. The image of Washington on the U.S. one‑dollar bill came from one of Stuart’s most famous paintings of Washington. In 1824, Stuart suffered a stroke which left him partially paralyzed, but he still continued to paint for two years until his death on July 9, 1828.",
		"Georgy Gause was born in Moscow, Russia. He was admitted to Moscow State University, where he received his undergraduate degree in 1931 and PhD in 1940. Prior to achieving his doctoral degree, Gause published his ecological classic, The Struggle for Existence, in 1934 (and in English!). This book and similar research papers in the 1930s helped lay the early foundation for population ecology and indeed fostered the introduction of mathematics into the historical development of ecology. In ecology, Gause’s contributions are equally acknowledged along with those of other early ecologists who studied population dynamics. However, most ecologists are not aware that Gause eventually went on to conduct very important research on antibiotics and somewhat left ecology behind. From 1960 until his death he was director of the institute of antibiotics he and his wife had founded.",
		"Josef Frank, born in Austria of Jewish heritage, studied architecture at the Vienna University of Technology. He then taught at the Vienna School of Arts and Crafts from 1919 to 1925. He founded an interior design firm together with some architect colleagues in 1925. He was one of early Vienna modernism’s most important figures, but already in the beginning of the 1920s he started to question modernism’s growing pragmatism. He had little appreciation for the French architect Le Corbusier’s belief that a house should be “a machine for living in.” He was against the standardized interior design trend of the time, fearing that it would make people all too uniform. He moved to Sweden with his Swedish wife in 1933 to escape growing Nazi discrimination and gained citizenship in 1939. He was the most prestigious designer at his Stockholm design company. In addition to his architectural work he created numerous designs for furniture, fabric, wallpaper and carpet.",
		"Jean Renoir (1894—1979), a French film director, was born in Paris, France. He was the son of the famous painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir. He and the rest of the Renoir family were the models of many of his father’s paintings. At the outbreak of World War I, Jean Renoir was serving in the French army but was wounded in the leg. In 1937, he made La Grande Illusion, one of his better-known films. It was enormously successful but was not allowed to show in Germany. During World War II, when the Nazis invaded France in 1940, he went to Hollywood in the United States and continued his career there. He was awarded numerous honors and awards throughout his career, including the Academy Honorary Award in 1975 for his lifetime achievements in the film industry. Overall, Jean Renoir’s influence as a film-maker and artist endures.",
		"Golden poison frogs are among the largest of the poison dart frogs, and can reach a length of over two inches as adults. They are active during the day and hunt insects using their long tongue to pull the prey to their mouth. They are considered the most poisonous animals on earth. They do not use their poison to hunt; it is only for defensive purposes. As they have virtually no natural predators, golden poison frogs make no attempt to hide from larger animals, and seem to be aware that they are not threatened by predators. They are social animals, and live in groups of four to seven individuals.",

		"The music business is very popular, and many young people like you are attracted towards this industry. As music becomes more accessible, it is increasingly easy for music to be copied. Some budding musicians steal other people’s work by copying popular artists and presenting it in the market as their own work. That is why music licensing is important. To protect your original songs from being stolen and copied, you as an artist can license what you have made and then sell the right to use your work to others. Then, although someone uses your music without permission, you, the original artist, can still get paid. Licensing protects music from being stolen and preserves both new and older music, and this is why music licensing exists.",
		"I have been a subscriber to your magazine for about 15 years. Your recent article on air pollution, which mentioned Fresno in the San Joaquin Valley of California, was essentially correct. However, it may have given the impression that Fresno is unlivable, which is far from the truth. The city is home to 500,000 living, breathing citizens, and the county some 900,000 souls. We are not all suffering. I ride my bike nearly every day and have yet to suffer any ill effects despite being well beyond retirement age. We are close to Yosemite and Sequoia national parks, a number of mountain lakes and rivers, and the Pacific Ocean is easily accessible. So contrary to the impression left by some writers, we Fresnans are not all suffering in some hell hole.",

Your company has distinguished itself as a leader in the construction industry by performing what appeared to be an almost impossible task. Working under difficult conditions and accelerated construction schedules, your company completed the building on June 1, as scheduled. This accomplishment is a result of the fine group of professional engineers and skilled craftsmen you assembled on site, and of the individual skill and dedication of your project manager, David Wallace.",
		"Two years ago, Green County Library decided to stay open until 8 p.m. every Thursday. This was to make library services available to people for whom evening was the only convenient time to visit. However, visitor numbers have not shown a strong demand for the later hours, and library officials determined that staff time would be more effectively utilized by adjusting operating hours. So I have to inform you that hours of operation at Green County Library will change starting October 8, 2015. Operating hours on Thursdays will return to normal, from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.. All normal library services will still be available during those hours. Additionally, the shift will allow Green County Library to improve and increase services to the community.",
		"Dear Ms. Franklin, I am writing regarding your company’s job offer. I am very grateful for this opportunity and am strongly considering accepting it. However, I have concerns regarding your request for an answer by December 1, 2015. As you know, accepting this offer would require moving my family across several states. I have a child in elementary school and my wife needs to care for her mother who lives here. As a result, I would like to ask if you might consider giving an additional week to consider your offer.

When we were young and didn’t have the money to go anywhere else, we would walk there almost every day. Now we are seniors, and my wife must use a wheelchair for extended walks. We find that the beautiful walking paths through the park are all but impassable to her.

		"Dear Mr. John Smith, I am a staff member at the Eastville Library, and I work weekday afternoons. Each day, as school closes, dozens of students come to the library to do homework, use the library’s computers, or socialize in a safe place. Many of these children would otherwise go home to empty houses, and the library is the one place that provides a secure, supervised alternative to being home alone. Your proposed policy of closing libraries on Mondays as a cost cutting measure could be harmful to these children, and I’m certain there are other ways to save money. I urge you and other city council representatives to cancel the plan and to keep libraries open! Sincerely, Kyle Tucker",

The land through which the proposed Pine Hill walking trail would cut is home to a variety of species. Wildlife faces pressure from development, and these animals need space where they can hide from human activity. Although trails serve as a wonderful source for us to access the natural world and appreciate the wildlife within it, if we continue to destroy habitats with excess trails, the wildlife will stop using these areas. Please reconsider whether the proposed trail is absolutely necessary. Sincerely, Tyler Stuart",

		"To the school librarian, I am Kyle Thomas, the president of the school’s English writing club. I have planned activities that will increase the writing skills of our club members. One of the aims of these activities is to make us aware of various types of news media and the language used in printed newspaper articles. However, some old newspapers are not easy to access online. It is, therefore, my humble request to you to allow us to use old newspapers that have been stored in the school library. I would really appreciate it if you grant us permission. Yours truly, Kyle Thomas",
		"Dear Ms. Robinson, The Warblers Choir is happy to announce that we are invited to compete in the International Young Choir Competition. The competition takes place in London on May 20. Though we wish to participate in the event, we do not have the necessary funds to travel to London. So we are kindly asking you to support us by coming to our fundraising concert.

		"Dear Boat Tour Manager, On March 15, my family was on one of your Glass Bottom Boat Tours. When we returned to our hotel, I discovered that I left behind my cell phone case. The case must have fallen off my lap and onto the floor when I took it off my phone to clean it. I would like to ask you to check if it is on your boat. Its color is black and it has my name on the inside. If you find the case, I would appreciate it if you would let me know. Sincerely, Sam Roberts",

We are requesting that children do not bring in home­cooked or prepared food. All food should arrive in a sealed packet with the ingredients clearly listed. Fruit and vegetables are welcomed if they are pre­packed in a sealed packet from the shop. Please DO NOT send any food into school containing nuts as we have many children with severe nut allergies.

		"Dear Mr. Krull, I have greatly enjoyed working at Trincom Enterprises as a sales manager. Since I joined in 2015, I have been a loyal and essential member of this company, and have developed innovative ways to contribute to the company. Moreover, in the last year alone, I have brought in two new major clients to the company, increasing the company’s total sales by 5%. Also, I have ​voluntarily trained 5 new members of staff, totaling 35 hours. I would therefore request your consideration in raising my salary, which I believe reflects my performance as well as the industry average. I look forward to speaking with you soon. Kimberly Morss",
		"To whom it may concern, I am a resident of the Blue Sky Apartment. Recently I observed that the kid zone is in need of repairs. I want you to pay attention to the poor condition of the playground equipment in the zone. The swings are damaged, the paint is falling off, and some of the bolts on the slide are missing. The facilities have been in this terrible condition since we moved here. They are dangerous to the children playing there. Would you please have them repaired? I would appreciate your immediate attention to solve this matter. Yours sincerely, Nina Davis",

The goal of the fair is to encourage them to be interested in science through guided experiments. We are looking for college students who can help with the experiments during the event.

		"Dear Ms. MacAlpine, I was so excited to hear that your brand is opening a new shop on Bruns Street next month. I have always appreciated the way your brand helps women to feel more stylish and confident. I am writing in response to your ad in the Bruns Journal. I graduated from the Meline School of Fashion and have worked as a sales assistant at LoganMart for the last five years. During that time, I’ve developed strong customer service and sales skills, and now I would like to apply for the sales position in your clothing store. I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for reading my letter. Yours sincerely, Grace Braddock",
		"Dear Ms. Jane Watson, I am John Austin, a science teacher at Crestville High School. Recently I was impressed by the latest book you wrote about the environment. Also my students read your book and had a class discussion about it. They are big fans of your book, so I’d like to ask you to visit our school and give a special lecture. We can set the date and time to suit your schedule. Having you at our school would be a fantastic experience for the students. We would be very grateful if you could come. Best regards, John Austin",
		"I’ve been a career woman for the past seven years. For a couple of years after giving birth to my first daughter, it was really tough for me to work and take care of her at the same time. So I know how necessary the babysitting service you’re providing is. And I feel really grateful for the service too. There is, however, one thing I’d like you to consider. Currently, a babysitter is taking care of my second daughter for eight hours from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. For me, it would be much more useful if the service were available from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Could you be more flexible with your service? I’d really appreciate it.",
		"If you eat most of your meals in a cafeteria, how much control can you have over where your food comes from? Most cafeteria food seems to originate in a large freezer truck at the loading dock behind the dining hall. Any farm behind those boxes of frozen fries and hamburgers is far away and hard to imagine. At a growing number of colleges, students are speaking up about becoming local food eaters. Many other schools have started asking the dining service to provide local foods because they’re concerned about the local farm economy, and because they’re worried about the environmental costs of foods that travel thousands of miles from the farm to the table. And now, it’s our turn!",
		"A plan was announced to install a new 400­acre landfill at Corcolle. Corcolle is an area of immense cultural and natural value not only for Italy but for all of humanity. To speak only of the most obvious site that requires our watchful and eternal protection, we note that Hadrian’s Villa is only a short distance from the proposed landfill. This unique UNESCO World Heritage Site is visited each year by hundreds of thousands of tourists from around the world. It is unthinkable that it or its immediate surroundings should suffer degradation of the kind that the proposed landfill clearly represents. Even the Province of Rome and the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities have expressed their concerns. We appeal to the Ministry of the Environment to announce immediately that the proposed project for a landfill at Corcolle will once and for all be abandoned to protect Hadrian’s Villa.",

		"To the Student Council, We are the members of the 11th grade band. Currently, since we have no practice room of our own, we have to practice twice a week in the multipurpose room. For the past two weeks, band practice has been canceled because other groups needed to use the room. Since the band tournament is only one month away, we are asking to be the only group to use the multipurpose room after school for this entire month. Principal Cooper has said that the entire student council must vote on our proposal. We hope that you will understand our situation and vote in our favor. Sincerely, The 11th Grade Band",

		"Dear Ms. Jones, Thank you for bringing your concerns to my attention―as a parent, I know it can be hard to ask these kinds of questions. I understand your concern about the degree of work involved in this class project, as well as your request for a deadline extension. We’ve been working hard on this over the course of the last month in order to spread out the work. In case you didn’t see it, I’m enclosing a copy of our class calendar as a helpful reference. Given the way we’ve been working up to this deadline, I’m afraid I can’t accept your request. I feel confident this is a fair timeline. I believe we can reach an understanding together. Thank you.

I no longer feel that I can be a useful contributor to the goals and mission of the organization. So I am writing to inform you that after much thought, I am regretfully resigning as a member of the Townsville Citizens Association. I also wish you to know that even though I may no longer be a member, I still sincerely hope for the continued success of this organization. Sincerely, Norman Smith",
		"Dear Ms. Rider, My wife and I have lived at the Spruce Apartments for the past twelve years. As you know, we recently renewed our lease with plans to stay for another year. In recent weeks, my wife’s health has taken a dramatic turn for the worse, and it is now apparent that we must move to an assisted­living facility where she can receive the help she needs. As longtime residents, I am writing to ask that we be released from the new lease. It would be a substantial hardship on us to pay for this apartment as well as an assisted­living facility. We would very much appreciate your consideration for us in this difficult time. I look forward to hearing from you. Sincerely, Henry Martin",
		"Dear Lauren Baker, We thank you for agreeing to play the music for my daughter’s wedding on September 17. Unfortunately, her fiancé, who is in the military, has received orders which make this date impossible, so we are moving the wedding date forward two weeks to September 3. Would it be possible for you to accommodate us on this date instead? All the other aspects of our agreement will remain the same. We would be most grateful if you could make this change and I really hope to see the extra touch of elegance added to my daughter’s wedding. Will you be gracing us with your presence? If you are unable to, please let us know as soon as possible so that we can make other arrangements. Sincerely, Bill Gibson",

I am currently teaching World History at Dreamers Academy and feel that my class would greatly appreciate a visit from someone like you who has had the experience of visiting such historical sites. It is my hope that you would be willing to give a special lecture to my class and share stories about your travels.

		"To whom it may concern: I am writing this email concerning one of your products. The image on your product Indian Green soup is not of an Indian dance but a Korean one. The image shows Buchaechum, a traditional Korean fan dance. It is clear that in the image the dancers are wearing traditional Korean dress. I searched online for images of an Indian fan dance, and of course, it looks very different from a Korean one. I know your company is putting a lot of effort into presenting authentic flavors, but Im afraid that this one small mistake could damage your companys reputation. I sincerely hope that you correct this as soon as possible. Sincerely, Susan Lee",

		"Dear Mr. Terry Walter, I am the principal of Springfield Public School. As you know, Springfield Public School is located at the intersection of First Street and Pine Street. The safety of our children is at risk largely due to the disregard for speed limits by motorists traveling along Pine Street. I have regularly witnessed vehicles traveling far in excess of the speed limit on Pine Street. Additionally, parents have expressed concern for the safety of their children who must cross Pine Street. For these reasons, we are requesting the installation of speed bumps on Pine Street. I know that one of your missions, as well as ours, is to ensure that our young people are afforded a safe and secure environment to and from school each day. I anticipate that your approval of this request will greatly improve the safety of our children. Sincerely, Emma Hudson",

We have recently been working on a project that looks at learning outcomes of children with disabilities. The project aims to build conversation around disability and to push for greater accessibility and inclusion. As part of this project, we are working on a video series, and I wonder if it is possible to film children in classes and around school for a day to show how a special needs school functions. I would greatly appreciate your assistance in this. Please let me know at your earliest convenience if this is possible. I understand that now is a busy time in the school year, but our project would benefit greatly from your cooperation. Best regards, Alexis Kerry",

When I first moved into the Greenfield Apartments, I was told that the apartment had been recently painted. Since that time, I have never touched the walls or the ceiling. Looking around over the past month has made me realize how old and dull the paint has become. I would like to update the apartment with a new coat of paint. I understand that this would be at my own expense, and that I must get permission to do so as per the lease agreement. Please advise at your earliest convenience. Sincerely, Howard James",
		"Dear Manager, I have been using your coffee machines for several years. Since your products had never let me down before, I bought your brand­new coffee machine, Morning Maker, on May 18th from your online store. Unfortunately, however, this product has not worked well.

We hold an annual festival to give our students a chance to share their music with the community and we always invite a famous musician to perform in the opening event.

That’s why we want to ask you to perform at the opening event of the festival. It would be an honor for them to watch one of the most famous violinists of all time play at the show. It would make the festival more colorful and splendid. We look forward to receiving a positive reply. Sincerely, Steven Forman",

We are one of the biggest faces of the school, winning a lot of awards and trophies. However, the school isn’t allowing our club to practice on the school field because a lot of teachers worry that we are going to mess up the field. This is causing us to lose practice time and ultimately results in creating a bad high school experience for us. We promise to use the space respectfully. Therefore, I’m asking you to allow us to use the school field for our dance practice. I would be grateful if you reconsider your decision. Thank you very much. Sincerely, Nancy Watson",
		"My name is Anthony Thompson and I am writing on behalf of the residents’ association. Our recycling program has been working well thanks to your participation. However, a problem has recently occurred that needs your attention. Because there is no given day for recycling, residents are putting their recycling out at any time. This makes the recycling area messy, which requires extra labor and cost. To deal with this problem, the residents’ association has decided on a day to recycle. I would like to let you know that you can put out your recycling on Wednesdays only. I am sure it will make our apartment complex look much more pleasant. Thank you in advance for your cooperation.",

While we are proud of our school’s history, the facilities are not exactly what they should be for modern schooling. Thanks to a generous donation to the school foundation, we will be able to start renovating those parts of our campus that have become outdated. We hope this will help provide our students with the best education possible. I’m writing to inform you that the auditorium will be the first building closed for repairs. Students will not be able to use the auditorium for about one month while the repairs are taking place. We hope that you will understand how this brief inconvenience will encourage community­wide benefits for years to come. Sincerely, Vice Principal Kyla Andrews",
		"To whom it may concern, I am a parent of a high school student who takes the 145 bus to commute to Clarkson High School. This is the only public transport available from our area and is used by many students. Recently, I heard that the city council is planning to discontinue this service. My husband and I start work early in the morning and this makes it impossible for us to drop our son off at school. It would take him nearly an hour to walk to school and there is a lot of traffic in the morning, so I do not consider it safe to bike. This matter will place many families, including ours, under a lot of stress. As a resident of Sunnyville, I think such a plan is unacceptable. I urge the council to listen to the concerns of the community. Sincerely, Lucy Jackson",

I fully appreciate that the original, special­offer ticket was non­exchangeable, but I did not know about the soccer match when I booked the tickets and I would be really grateful if you could do this for me.

Our storytelling program has been so well‑attended that we are planning to expand the program to 6 days each week. This means that we need to recruit more volunteers to read to the children. People still talk about the week you filled in for us when one of our volunteers couldn’t come. You really brought those stories to life!

I’m especially interested in purchasing the painting that depicts the horizon, titled Sunrise. I would like to know if the piece is still available for purchase. It would be a great pleasure to house this wonderful piece of art. I look forward to your reply to this inquiry.",
		"Dear parents, Regular attendance at school is essential in maximizing student potential. Recently, we’ve become concerned about the number of unapproved absences across all grades. I would like to further clarify that your role as a parent is to approve any school absence. Parents must provide an explanation for absences to the school within 7 days from the first day of any period of absence. Where an explanation has not been received within the 7­day time frame, the school will record the absence as unjustified on the student’s record.

There is a bus stop about halfway along Fenny Road, at which the No. 35 buses are supposed to stop. It would appear, however, that some of your drivers are either unaware of this bus stop or for some reason choose to ignore it, driving past even though the buses are not full.

With the help of students and staff, we aim to significantly reduce the amount of paper that goes into the trash by recycling paper. We currently have a dumpster that will hold the paper recycling, but we need containers for individual classrooms to meet our goal. We would like to request 20 containers. We also need 2,000 clear trash bags in order to allow students and staff to get the paper to the recycle dumpster. So, we are asking your company if it will donate these items so that we may succeed in conserving our natural resources. Please contact me if you have any questions.

Due to very tight schedules and extreme traffic conditions, our drivers and security attendants are trained not to wait for late students. Students should arrive at the bus stop approximately 5 minutes before the scheduled departure in the morning. This ensures riders are ready to board the bus when it reaches the stop and promotes an on-time arrival at school. The same applies for the afternoon commute. Barbara Howe, Principal",
		"Dear Ms. Mattie, Thank you very much for offering me the research engineer position at ABC Company. However, after a great deal of thought, I have decided not to accept the position.

Unfortunately, I cannot accept your offer because I have decided to pursue another opportunity. Once again, thank you for your consideration. Very truly yours, Christine Mahoe",

		"Dear Sir or Madam: I am writing to you regarding a price discrepancy I encountered between an item offered in your retail store and the same item offered on your website. I recently ordered an outfit from your online store, item #N4A8-BL. The price listed on the site was $109, which was paid by credit card. Please take a look at the attached receipt. Three days later, while shopping at our local mall, I visited one of your retail shops and found the exact same outfit priced at $79. I would like to ask for a refund of the price difference. I am assuming that this would be a better solution to packing up the outfit and shipping it back to you for a full refund. Sincerely, Patricia Cavelli",

We are pleased about your comment as customers’ satisfaction is the main motto of our service. It’s very rare that the customers take time to give thanks for the services, so we would like to use this letter as an example of the customer’s satisfactory remarks in our new brochure if you give us permission to do so.

We will be contacting you soon to hear your decision regarding putting your remarks in the brochure. Sincerely, Oliver Watson",
		"Dear Mr. Luckman, A few weeks ago I bought a decorative bowl manufactured by your company. Although it makes a beautiful centerpiece for my table, I noticed on the enclosed information leaflet that the bowl gives off harmful chemicals when microwaved. I think that many customers are unaware of the danger of chemical poisoning. Knowing how dangerous chemical poisoning is, I think it’s important that you adequately warn customers not to microwave the bowl. I suggest that you use bold print on the outside of the box. Clarify that the notice of harmful chemicals is a warning, not just a characteristic of the clay. Please consider this so that unnecessary poisoning does not occur. Sincerely, Andy Rooney",
		"Dear Ms. Molly Oliver, This is Mark Foster, one of the volunteers for the Auditory Frog and Toad Survey. Unfortunately, I was not able to participate in the orientation last weekend, so I could not receive training in distinguishing the sounds of frogs and toads. I heard from another participant that a CD was used in the training session. I was wondering if you could send me one. Since we have ten more days before the survey begins, I’ll have enough time to receive and use the CD to train myself. You can send it to me at the address in my application. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you. Sincerely, Mark Foster",

The Smalltown Art Museum grounds will be the site of both the ceremony and the reception. My daughter and I anticipate that, between the two families, about fifty couples will need accommodations for the night of May 20.

I’ve requested a change in work assignments so that I can minimize time standing on my feet. I’ve asked that I be given a clerical job in the warehouse rather than continuing my duties of loading and unloading trucks. I need a statement from you which summarizes the medical problems related to my feet.

		"Dear Jackie, I was pleased to receive your request for a letter of recommendation for admission and a scholarship to the University of Andew. Of course, I’ve known your parents for years through various projects in the community, but I’m afraid my knowledge of your own academic abilities, character, and goals is extremely limited. Although I’d be happy to comment about the fine relationship I have with your parents, I hesitate to pass judgment on someone I’ve had very little association with at all. Perhaps you could find someone who could give you a much better recommendation than I could. I wish you the best in your academic pursuits at the University of Andew. Sincerely, Mark Harris",

		"Dear staff, Next Monday, Nature’s Beauty Gardens will have the pleasure of hosting very important guests for the annual “Toddler Trek” event. We hope that this will be fun, educational, and most importantly safe for the toddlers. Parents and children are going to spend time enjoying outdoor activities and having a picnic lunch. It is therefore very important to check the garden for potential dangers. Managers of each department must make sure that all dangerous equipment and machinery are safely stored. Also, for the safety of our guests at this event, garden chemicals will not be used anywhere in Nature’s Beauty Gardens. Thank you for your cooperation in this safety check and for helping to make this year’s “Toddler Trek” event the best one yet. Best regards, Laura Alfaro, Managing Director",

In the six months that you have been an employee here, the entire Drainage Department has demonstrated marked improvement in both billing and accounts receivable, largely because of your enthusiasm and administrative support. However, it is our policy at Northstar to assess employee performance and award raises annually. Since you have not yet reached your first anniversary as an employee with us, I cannot grant your request for a raise.

But we ask that you complete this form indicating your preference and have your child return it no later than May 10, 2019.",
		"To Whom It May Concern: As a lifelong Springfield resident who has two children attending George May Elementary School, I have spent a lot of time at the Springfield Park both as a youth and as a mother. I have recognized the need for upgrades that would enhance the lives of residents. The current park has outdated BBQ facilities and tables as well as a patchy and uneven lawn area that at most times is not much more than a mud pit. The baseball field and spectator area is completely worn out as well. The renovation will ensure that the children of our community have a safe place to play and engage in sports to occupy their time. I ask that you take the time to seriously address this issue.

		"Dear Mr. Brandson, Last week I returned to Chipchester after ten relaxing days on your ‘Barbados Escape Tour’. Except for the swimming pool, the facilities at the Barbados Sun Resort were excellent, and equal to your usual high standard. Unfortunately, for the whole of my time at the Barbados resort, extensive repairs were being carried out at the swimming pool and it could not be used. It is not my nature to complain, but I do feel that the use of a pool is very important to an English tourist who cannot enjoy swimming in England because of the unpleasant weather. I believe it is your responsibility to inform guests about repairs that may negatively affect their stays. I hope this kind of inconvenience will not happen again. Yours sincerely, Chris Bauer",

		"To whom it may concern, My name is Daniel. Since I joined your youth sports program several years ago, I have really enjoyed swimming. Thanks to your program, I have become a good swimmer. Now I want to go one step further. I like helping people and hope to get a job as a lifeguard later. So I tried to sign up for your lifeguard training course this summer. But the course was so popular that the registration closed almost as soon as it opened. I couldn’t register and was really disappointed. I heard some of my friends couldn’t, either. I’m kindly asking you to open an additional course. I appreciate your consideration. Sincerely, Daniel Smith",
		"Dear Ms. Martinez, We are planning to open a school for the underprivileged students of the locality at Norristown. As a non­profit organization, the school will be run only on your contributions and resources as gifts to the children we hope to help. Our outline of the school is at a primitive stage currently, and its execution and extension are hugely dependent on your donations. These children that we hope to help are often seen working in factories and cafes due to their family’s financial difficulties. It is a great disappointment that such a young population of our community is wasted and cannot see the light of education. Kindly look at our plan on our website www.dreamproject.com and donate at your convenience. We hope that you will be a part of our project and look forward to further support and encouragement. Sincerely, Doris Middleton",

I believe the Garden Café Gallery would be a perfect place to host the event, as your gallery is well-known for its beautiful garden. The exhibition is usually held throughout October, and we very much hope that we can rent a space for the exhibition at the Garden Café Gallery during this time. I look forward to your response.

		"Dear City Council Members, My name is Celina Evans and I am a lifelong Woodridge resident. The Woodridge Children’s Theater has been the pride of our community since 1975. My daughter Katie has been participating in the theater’s activities for six years. The theater has meant so much to so many in our community. However, I have been made aware that you are considering cutting the budget of the theater. The experiences and life lessons children gain at the theater are invaluable. Not only do kids learn about the arts there, but they also learn skills that will last for a lifetime. To reduce funding would be a huge loss to future generations and thus I strongly object to it. Thank you for your consideration in this matter. Sincerely, Celina Evans",

		"I’m Maggie Morgan, a long­time fan of the Wakefield Community Theatre. I’m well aware that in this difficult economy, organisations such as the Wakefield Community Theatre are facing financial difficulties and therefore an increase in ticket prices is inevitable. But in my opinion, a 50 percent increase to the price of individual tickets seems totally unreasonable. It would mean that ordinary residents like myself will have fewer opportunities to enjoy a quality drama performance. Pricing tickets out of the range of local residents is not a good option, because it’ll hurt your organisation in years to come. I’m sure there will be other ways to get financial support instead of raising ticket prices so much. I hope to hear from you soon on this matter.",

Very truly yours, Charles Moore",

		"To whom it may concern, I sometimes travel to Summerland to visit friends. One of the first landmarks to captivate me there years ago was the Mackenzie-Brown House. Last week, I visited again after a long time away, and I was shocked at the state of the house ―yard overgrown and stains on the beautiful walls. I am particularly sensitive to historic sites falling into disrepair. I certainly can’t understand why you have neglected such a landmark, and I ask that you please restore the Mackenzie-Brown House. I cannot imagine how heartbreaking it must be for the residents of Summerland to witness the decline of this historic building. With kind regards, Holly Bebernitz",

Last week, I made a reservation for one of your company’s swimming pools for our summer swim camp.

		"To whom it may concern, Thank you very much for faithfully responding to our request six months ago and taking corresponding measures. Even after the installation of road traffic safety facilities, we still need more for the safety of our students. It is a problem with the school road, which students use on their way to and from school. The width of the current school road is barely wide enough for two people to walk side by side. So, there are risks of collision with vehicles on the road where students walk and accidents if many students flock to the narrow school road. Therefore, we ask you to expand the school road for students’ safety. I would appreciate it if you could respond as soon as possible. Sincerely, Alisha Lee",

		"It has been a privilege to serve in this company for the past four years. The experiences and insights I have gained as a safety manager have been invaluable. However, after careful consideration, I have accepted a position at another company and will be leaving Lewis Ltd. This was not an easy decision to make, but I am confident that my new role will help me with my future goals. My last day of work will be on April 30th. I will do all I can to assist in a smooth transfer of duties. I wish both you and Lewis Ltd. every good fortune.",
		"Dear Coach Johnson, My name is Christina Markle, Bradley Markle’s mother. Bradley and I were thrilled to learn that you’re holding your Gymnastics Summer Camp again this year. So I didn’t hesitate to sign up and pay the non-refundable deposit for the second week program, which is from July 13 to 17. But today I remembered that our family is going to get back from a trip on July 13, and I’m afraid Bradley won’t be able to make it on the very first day of the program. Rather than make him skip the day, I’d like to check to see if he could switch to the third week program. Please let us know if that’s possible. Thank you. Sincerely, Christina Markle",

		"Dear Mr. Reese, A few days ago, I submitted my application and recipe for the 2nd Annual DC Metro Cooking Contest. However, I would like to change my recipe if it is possible. I have checked the website again, but I could only find information about the contest date, time, and prizes. I couldn’t see any information about changing recipes. I have just created a great new recipe, and I believe people will love this more than the one I have already submitted. Please let me know if I can change my submitted recipe. I look forward to your response. Best Regards, Sophia Walker",
		"Dear Mr. Kayne, I am a resident of Cansinghill Apartments, located right next to the newly opened Vuenna Dog Park. As I live with three dogs, I am very happy to let my dogs run around and safely play with other dogs from the neighborhood. However, the noise of barking and yelling from the park at night is so loud and disturbing that I cannot relax in my apartment. Many of my apartment neighbors also seriously complain about this noise. I want immediate action to solve this urgent problem. Since you are the manager of Vuenna Dog Park, I ask you to take measures to prevent the noise at night. I hope to hear from you soon. Sincerely, Monty Kim",

		"People are innately inclined to look for causes of events, to form explanations and stories. That is one reason storytelling is such a persuasive medium. Stories resonate with our experiences and provide examples of new instances. From our experiences and the stories of others we tend to form generalizations about the way people behave and things work. We attribute causes to events, and as long as these cause­-and-effect pairings make sense, we use them for understanding future events. Yet these causal attributions are often mistaken. Sometimes they implicate the wrong causes, and for some things that happen, there is no single cause. Rather, there is a complex chain of events that all contribute to the result; if any one of the events would not have occurred, the result would be different. But even when there is no single causal act, that doesn’t stop people from assigning one.",
		"Discovering how people are affected by jokes is often difficult. People mask their reactions because of politeness or peer pressure. Moreover, people are sometimes unaware of how they, themselves, are affected. Denial, for example, may conceal from people how deeply wounded they are by certain jokes. Jokes can also be termites or time bombs, lingering unnoticed in a person’s subconscious, gnawing on his or her self­esteem or exploding it at a later time. But even if one could accurately determine how people are affected, this would not be an accurate measure of hatefulness. People are often simply wrong about whether a joke is acceptable or hateful. For example, people notoriously find terribly hateful jokes about themselves or their sex, nationalities, professions, etc. unproblematic until their consciousness becomes raised. And the raising of consciousness is often followed by a period of hypersensitivity where people are hurt or offended even by tasteful, tactful jokes.",
		"It’s a small world, and business brings people from all cultures together. You may attend a meeting with a foreign visitor, or you may be sent off to a country with a language you don’t understand. A language gap is a great opportunity for good manners to shine. The best course of action is a little preparation. You can obtain a phrase book and learn a few basic expressions - “Good morning,” “Please,” “Thank you,” “I’m pleased to meet you,” and “Goodbye.” Making an effort to communicate in another person’s language shows your respect for that person.",
		"When people share the same daily, weekly, monthly, and seasonal rhythms, connections among them form faster and stay stronger. The people trust each other more deeply, and coordination becomes easier. After all, they are frequently doing the same things and working on the same problems together. In fact, several organizations use regular stand-up meetings to maintain strong bonds and reinforce a shared mindset. A CEO of a food company talks about his short daily meeting with his team. He explains, “The rhythm that frequency generates allows relationships to strengthen, personal habits to be understood, and stressors to be identified. All of this helps the members of the team understand not only their roles but also how they can get the best out of one another.”",
		"Honesty is a fundamental part of every strong relationship. Use it to your advantage by being open with what you feel and giving a truthful opinion when asked. This approach can help you escape uncomfortable social situations and make friends with honest people. Follow this simple policy in life—never lie. When you develop a reputation for always telling the truth, you will enjoy strong relationships based on trust. It will also be more difficult to manipulate you. People who lie get into trouble when someone threatens to uncover their lie. By living true to yourself, you’ll avoid a lot of headaches. Your relationships will also be free from the poison of lies and secrets. Don’t be afraid to be honest with your friends, no matter how painful the truth is. In the long term, lies with good intentions hurt people much more than telling the truth.",
		"Technological development often forces change, and change is uncomfortable. This is one of the main reasons why technology is often resisted and why some perceive it as a threat. It is important to understand our natural hate of being uncomfortable when we consider the impact of technology on our lives. As a matter of fact, most of us prefer the path of least resistance. This tendency means that the true potential of new technologies may remain unrealized because, for many, starting something new is just too much of a struggle. Even our ideas about how new technology can enhance our lives may be discouraged by this natural desire for comfort.",
		"We often ignore small changes because they don’t seem to matter very much in the moment. If you save a little money now, you’re still not a millionaire. If you study Spanish for an hour tonight, you still haven’t learned the language. We make a few changes, but the results never seem to come quickly and so we slide back into our previous routines. The slow pace of transformation also makes it difficult to break a bad habit. If you eat an unhealthy meal today, the scale doesn’t move much. A single decision is easy to ignore. But when we repeat small errors, day after day, by following poor decisions again and again, our small choices add up to bad results. Many missteps eventually lead to a problem.",
		"When the price of something fundamental drops greatly, the whole world can change. Consider light. Chances are you are reading this sentence under some kind of artificial light. Moreover, you probably never thought about whether using artificial light for reading was worth it. Light is so cheap that you use it without thinking. But in the early 1800s, it would have cost you four hundred times what you are paying now for the same amount of light. At that price, you would notice the cost and would think twice before using artificial light to read a book. The drop in the price of light lit up the world. Not only did it turn night into day, but it allowed us to live and work in big buildings that natural light could not enter. Nearly nothing we have today would be possible if the cost of artificial light had not dropped to almost nothing.",
		"Detailed study over the past two or three decades is showing that the complex forms of natural systems are essential to their functioning. The attempt to straighten rivers and give them regular cross­sections is perhaps the most disastrous example of this form­and­function relationship. The natural river has a very irregular form: it curves a lot, spills across floodplains, and leaks into wetlands, giving it an ever­changing and incredibly complex shoreline. This allows the river to accommodate variations in water level and speed. Pushing the river into tidy geometry destroys functional capacity and results in disasters like the Mississippi floods of 1927 and 1993 and, more recently, the unnatural disaster of Hurricane Katrina. A $50 billion plan to “let the river loose” in Louisiana recognizes that the controlled Mississippi is washing away twenty-­four square miles of that state annually.",
		"Hunting can explain how humans developed reciprocal altruism and social exchange. Humans seem to be unique among primates in showing extensive reciprocal relationships that can last years, decades, or a lifetime. Meat from a large game animal comes in quantities that exceed what a single hunter and his immediate family could possibly consume. Furthermore, hunting success is highly variable; a hunter who is successful one week might fail the next. These conditions encourage food sharing from hunting. The costs to a hunter of giving away meat he cannot eat immediately are low because he cannot consume all the meat himself and leftovers will soon spoil. The benefits can be large, however, when those who are given his food return the generous favor later on when he has failed to get food for himself. In essence, hunters can store extra meat in the bodies of their friends and neighbors.",
		"For species approaching extinction, zoos can act as a last chance for survival. Recovery programs are established to coordinate the efforts of field conservationists and wildlife authorities. As populations of those species diminish it is not unusual for zoos to start captive breeding programs. Captive breeding acts to protect against extinction. In some cases captive-bred individuals may be released back into the wild, supplementing wild populations. This is most successful in situations where individuals are at greatest threat during a particular life stage. For example, turtle eggs may be removed from high-risk locations until after they hatch. This may increase the number of turtles that survive to adulthood. Crocodile programs have also been successful in protecting eggs and hatchlings, releasing hatchlings once they are better equipped to protect themselves.",
		"Rejection is an everyday part of our lives, yet most people can’t handle it well. For many, it’s so painful that they’d rather not ask for something at all than ask and risk rejection. Yet, as the old saying goes, if you don’t ask, the answer is always no. Avoiding rejection negatively affects many aspects of your life. All of that happens only because you’re not tough enough to handle it. For this reason, consider rejection therapy. Come up with a request or an activity that usually results in a rejection. Working in sales is one such example. Asking for discounts at the stores will also work. By deliberately getting yourself rejected you’ll grow a thicker skin that will allow you to take on much more in life, thus making you more successful at dealing with unfavorable circumstances.",
		"Do you sometimes feel like you don’t love your life? Like, deep inside, something is missing? That’s because we are living someone else’s life. We allow other people to influence our choices. We are trying to meet their expectations. Social pressure is deceiving―we are all impacted without noticing it. Before we realize we are losing ownership of our lives, we end up envying how other people live. Then, we can only see the greener grass―ours is never good enough. To regain that passion for the life you want, you must recover control of your choices. No one but yourself can choose how you live. But, how? The first step to getting rid of expectations is to treat yourself kindly. You can’t truly love other people if you don’t love yourself first. When we accept who we are, there’s no room for other’s expectations.",
		"It is widely believed that certain herbs somehow magically improve the work of certain organs, and “cure” specific diseases as a result. Such statements are unscientific and groundless. Sometimes herbs appear to work, since they tend to increase your blood circulation in an aggressive attempt by your body to eliminate them from your system. That can create a temporary feeling of a high, which makes it seem as if your health condition has improved. Also, herbs can have a placebo effect, just like any other method, thus helping you feel better. Whatever the case, it is your body that has the intelligence to regain health, and not the herbs. How can herbs have the intelligence needed to direct your body into getting healthier? That is impossible. Try to imagine how herbs might come into your body and intelligently fix your problems. If you try to do that, you will see how impossible it seems. Otherwise, it would mean that herbs are more intelligent than the human body, which is truly hard to believe.",
		"Plant growth is controlled by a group of hormones called auxins found at the tips of stems and roots of plants. Auxins produced at the tips of stems tend to accumulate on the side of the stem that is in the shade. Accordingly, the auxins stimulate growth on the shaded side of the plant. Therefore, the shaded side grows faster than the side facing the sunlight. This phenomenon causes the stem to bend and appear to be growing towards the light. Auxins have the opposite effect on the roots of plants. Auxins in the tips of roots tend to limit growth. If a root is horizontal in the soil, the auxins will accumulate on the lower side and interfere with its development. Therefore, the lower side of the root will grow slower than the upper side. This will, in turn, cause the root to bend downwards, with the tip of the root growing in that direction.",
		"The major philosophical shift in the idea of selling came when industrial societies became more affluent, more competitive, and more geographically spread out during the 1940s and 1950s. This forced business to develop closer relations with buyers and clients, which in turn made business realize that it was not enough to produce a quality product at a reasonable price. In fact, it was equally essential to deliver products that customers actually wanted. Henry Ford produced his best­selling T­model Ford in one color only (black) in 1908, but in modern societies this was no longer possible. The modernization of society led to a marketing revolution that destroyed the view that production would create its own demand. Customers, and the desire to meet their diverse and often complex needs, became the focus of business.",
		"Advertisers often displayed considerable facility in adapting their claims to the market status of the goods they promoted. Fleischmann’s yeast, for instance, was used as an ingredient for cooking homemade bread. Yet more and more people in the early 20th century were buying their bread from stores or bakeries, so consumer demand for yeast decreased. The producer of Fleischmann’s yeast hired the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency to come up with a different marketing strategy to boost sales. No longer the “Soul of Bread,” the Thompson agency first turned yeast into an important source of vitamins with significant health benefits. Shortly thereafter, the advertising agency transformed yeast into a natural laxative. Repositioning yeast helped increase sales.",
		"While moving is difficult for everyone, it is particularly stressful for children. They lose their sense of security and may feel disoriented when their routine is disrupted and all that is familiar is taken away. Young children, ages 3-6, are particularly affected by a move. Their understanding at this stage is quite literal, and it is hard for them to imagine beforehand a new home and their new room. Young children may have worries such as “Will I still be me in the new place?” and “Will my toys and bed come with us?” It is important to establish a balance between validating children’s past experiences and focusing on helping them adjust to the new place. Children need to have opportunities to share their backgrounds in a way that respects their past as an important part of who they are. This contributes to building a sense of community, which is essential for all children, especially those in transition.",
		"The term minimalism gives a negative impression to some people who think that it is all about sacrificing valuable possessions. This insecurity naturally stems from their attachment to their possessions. It is difficult to distance oneself from something that has been around for quite some time. Being an emotional animal, human beings give meaning to the things around them. So, the question arising here is that if minimalism will hurt one’s emotions, why become a minimalist? The answer is very simple; the assumption of the question is fundamentally wrong. Minimalism does not hurt emotions. You might feel a bit sad while getting rid of a useless item but sooner than later, this feeling will be overcomed by the joy of clarity. Minimalists never argue that you should leave every convenience of the modern era. They are of the view that you only need to eliminate stuff that is unused or not going to be used in the near future.",
		"The rate of speed at which one is traveling will greatly determine the ability to process detail in the environment. In evolutionary terms, human senses are adapted to the speed at which humans move through space under their own power while walking. Our ability to distinguish detail in the environment is therefore ideally suited to movement at speeds of perhaps five miles per hour and under. The fastest users of the street, motorists, therefore have a much more limited ability to process details along the street―a motorist simply has little time or ability to appreciate design details. On the other hand, pedestrian travel, being much slower, allows for the appreciation of environmental detail. Joggers and bicyclists fall somewhere in between these polar opposites; while they travel faster than pedestrians, their rate of speed is ordinarily much slower than that of the typical motorist.",
		"Suspense takes up a great share of our interest in life. A play or a novel is often robbed of much of its interest if you know the plot beforehand. We like to keep guessing as to the outcome. The circus acrobat employs this principle when he achieves a feat after purposely failing to perform it several times. Even the deliberate manner in which he arranges the opening scene increases our expectation. In the last act of a play, a little circus dog balances a ball on its nose. One night when the dog hesitated and worked with a long time before he would perform his feat, he got a lot more applause than when he did his trick at once. We not only like to wait, feeling nervous, but we appreciate what we wait for.",
		"It is important to remember that a misunderstanding is never ended by an argument but by a sympathetic desire to see the other person’s view. As Buddha said, “Hatred is never ended by hatred but by love.” Here is an example: Pat Duffy was selling cars for General Motors. If a buyer made a negative remark about the car he was selling, Pat would get upset at the customer. He would talk back to the customer and win lots of arguments, but he didn’t sell many cars. Finally, he learned to handle the customers and here is how. If a customer said, “This GM car is no good! I would rather buy a Ford car,” Pat, instead of arguing, said, “Ford cars are good, and it is a fine company.” This made the customer speechless. There was no room for argument. Now instead of wasting time arguing about Ford cars, Pat got off that subject and concentrated on the GM cars he was selling.",
		"Historical evidence points to workers being exploited by employers in the absence of appropriate laws. This means that workers are not always compensated for their contributions, for their increased productivity, as economic theory would suggest. Employers will be able to exploit workers if they are not legally controlled. Thus, the minimum wage laws may be the only way to prevent many employees from working at wages that are below the poverty line. This point of view means that minimum wage laws are a source of correcting for existing market failure, enhancing the power of markets to create efficient results.",
		"The overabundance of options in today’s marketplace gives you more freedom of choice. However, there may be a price to pay in terms of happiness. According to research by psychologists David Myers and Robert Lane, all this choice often makes people depressed. Researchers gave some shoppers 24 choices of jams to taste and others only 6 choices. Those who had fewer choices were happier with the tasting. Even more surprisingly, the ones with a smaller selection purchased jam 31% of the time, while those with a wider range of choices only purchased jam 3% of the time. The ironic thing about this is that people nearly always say they want more choices. Yet, the more options they have, the more paralyzed they become. Savvy restaurant owners provide fewer choices. This allows customers to feel more relaxed, prompting them to choose easily and leave more satisfied with their choices.",
		"Although instances occur in which partners start their relationship by telling everything about themselves to each other, such instances are rare. In most cases, the amount of disclosure increases over time. We begin relationships by revealing relatively little about ourselves; then if our first bits of self­disclosure are well received and bring on similar responses from the other person, we’re willing to reveal more. This principle is important to remember. It would usually be a mistake to assume that the way to build a strong relationship would be to reveal the most private details about yourself when first making contact with another person. Unless the circumstances are unique, such baring of your soul would be likely to scare potential partners away rather than bring them closer.",
		"Allowing people to influence each other reduces the precision of a group’s estimate. To derive the most useful information from multiple sources of evidence, you should always try to make these sources independent of each other. This rule is part of good police procedure. When there are multiple witnesses to an event, they are not allowed to discuss it before giving their testimony. The goal is not only to prevent collusion by hostile witnesses, it is also to prevent witnesses from influencing each other. Witnesses who exchange their experiences will tend to make similar errors in their testimony, reducing the total value of the information they provide. The standard practice of open discussion gives too much weight to the opinions of those who speak early and confidently, causing others to line up behind them.",
		"Painters have in principle an infinite range of colours at their disposal, especially in modern times with the chromatic explosion of synthetic chemistry. And yet painters don’t use all the colours at once, and indeed many have used a remarkably restrictive selection. Mondrian limited himself mostly to the three primaries red, yellow and blue to fill his black­ruled grids, and Kasimir Malevich worked with similar self­imposed restrictions. For Yves Klein, one colour was enough; Franz Kline’s art was typically black on white. There was nothing new in this: the Greeks and Romans tended to use just red, yellow, black and white. Why? It’s impossible to generalize, but both in antiquity and modernity it seems likely that the limited palette aided clarity and comprehensibility, and helped to focus attention on the components that mattered: shape and form.",
		"A champion of free speech and religious toleration, Voltaire was a controversial figure. He is, for instance, supposed to have declared, “I hate what you say, but will defend to the death your right to say it,” a powerful defense of the idea that even views that you despise deserve to be heard. In eighteenth­century Europe, however, the Catholic Church strictly controlled what could be published. Many of Voltaire’s plays and books were censored and burned in public, and he was even imprisoned in the Bastille in Paris because he had insulted a powerful aristocrat. But none of this stopped him challenging the prejudices and pretensions of those around him. In his short philosophical novel, Candide, he completely undermined the kind of religious optimism about humanity and the universe that other contemporary thinkers had expressed, and he did it in such an entertaining way that the book became an instant bestseller. Wisely, Voltaire left his name off the title page, otherwise its publication would have landed him in prison again for making fun of religious beliefs.",
		"I was sitting outside a restaurant in Spain one summer evening, waiting for dinner. The aroma of the kitchens excited my taste buds. My future meal was coming to me in the form of molecules drifting through the air, too small for my eyes to see but detected by my nose. The ancient Greeks first came upon the idea of atoms this way; the smell of baking bread suggested to them that small particles of bread existed beyond vision. The cycle of weather reinforced this idea: a puddle of water on the ground gradually dries out, disappears, and then falls later as rain. They reasoned that there must be particles of water that turn into steam, form clouds, and fall to earth, so that the water is conserved even though the little particles are too small to see. My paella in Spain had inspired me, four thousand years too late, to take the credit for atomic theory.",
		"Sudden success or winnings can be very dangerous. Neurologically, chemicals are released in the brain that give a powerful burst of excitement and energy, leading to the desire to repeat this experience. It can be the start of any kind of addiction or manic behavior. Also, when gains come quickly we tend to lose sight of the basic wisdom that true success, to really last, must come through hard work. We do not take into account the role that luck plays in such unexpected gains. We try again and again to recapture that high from winning so much money or attention. We acquire feelings of superiority. We become especially resistant to anyone who tries to warn us— they don’t understand, we tell ourselves. Because this cannot be sustained, we experience an inevitable fall, which is all the more painful, leading to the depression part of the cycle. Although gamblers are the most prone to this, it equally applies to businesspeople during bubbles and to people who gain sudden attention from the public.",
		"Spine­tingling ghost stories are fun to tell if they are really scary, and even more so if you claim that they are true. People get a thrill from passing on those stories. The same applies to miracle stories. If a rumor of a miracle gets written down in a book, the rumor becomes hard to challenge, especially if the book is ancient. If a rumor is old enough, it starts to be called a “tradition” instead, and then people believe it all the more. This is rather odd because you might think they would realize that older rumors have had more time to get distorted than younger rumors that are close in time to the alleged events themselves. Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson lived too recently for traditions to have grown up, so not many people believe stories like “Elvis seen on Mars.”",
		"The objective point of view is illustrated by John Ford’s “philosophy of camera.” Ford considered the camera to be a window and the audience to be outside the window viewing the people and events within. We are asked to watch the actions as if they were taking place at a distance, and we are not asked to participate. The objective point of view employs a static camera as much as possible in order to produce this window effect, and it concentrates on the actors and the action without drawing attention to the camera. The objective camera suggests an emotional distance between camera and subject; the camera seems simply to be recording, as straightforwardly as possible, the characters and actions of the story. For the most part, the director uses natural, normal types of camera positioning and camera angles. The objective camera does not comment on or interpret the action but merely records it, letting it unfold. We see the action from the viewpoint of an impersonal observer. If the camera moves, it does so unnoticeably, calling as little attention to itself as possible.",
		"Let’s return to a time in which photographs were not in living color. During that period, people referred to pictures as “photographs” rather than “black‑and‑white photographs” as we do today. The possibility of color did not exist, so it was unnecessary to insert the adjective “black‑and‑white.” However, suppose we did include the phrase “black‑and‑white” before the existence of color photography. By highlighting that reality, we become conscious of current limitations and thus open our minds to new possibilities and potential opportunities. World War I was given that name only after we were deeply embattled in World War II. Before that horrific period of the 1940s, World War I was simply called “The Great War” or, even worse, “The War to End All Wars.” What if we had called it “World War I” back in 1918? Such a label might have made the possibility of a second worldwide conflict an large reality for governments and individuals. We become conscious of issues when we explicitly identify them.",
		"Human innovation in agriculture has unlocked modifications in apples, tulips, and potatoes that never would have been realized through a plant’s natural reproductive cycles. This cultivation process has created some of the recognizable vegetables and fruits consumers look for in their grocery stores. However, relying on only a few varieties of cultivated crops can leave humankind vulnerable to starvation and agricultural loss if a harvest is destroyed. For example, a million people died over the course of three years during the Irish potato famine because the Irish relied primarily on potatoes and milk to create a nutritionally balanced meal. In order to continue its symbiotic relationship with cultivated plants, humanity must allow for biodiversity and recognize the potential drawbacks that monocultures of plants can introduce. Planting seeds of all kinds, even if they don’t seem immediately useful or profitable, can ensure the longevity of those plants for generations to come. A balance must be struck between nature’s capacity for wildness and humanity’s desire for control.",
		"In order for us to be able to retain valuable pieces of information, our brain has to forget in a manner that is both targeted and controlled. Can you recall, for example, your very first day of school? You most likely have one or two noteworthy images in your head, such as putting your crayons and pencils into your pencil case. But that’s probably the extent of the specifics. Those additional details that are apparently unimportant are actively deleted from your brain the more you go about remembering the situation. The reason for this is that the brain does not consider it valuable to remember all of the details as long as it is able to convey the main message (i.e., your first day of school was great). In fact, studies have shown that the brain actively weakens regions responsible for insignificant or minor memory content that tends to disturb the main memory. Over time, the minor details vanish more and more, though this in turn serves to sharpen the most important messages of the past.",
		"What exactly does normal science involve? According to Thomas Kuhn it is primarily a matter of puzzle­solving. However successful a paradigm is, it will always encounter certain problems—phenomena which it cannot easily accommodate, or mismatches between the theory’s predictions and the experimental facts. The job of the normal scientist is to try to eliminate these minor puzzles while making as few changes as possible to the paradigm. So normal science is a conservative activity—its practitioners are not trying to make any earth­shattering discoveries, but rather just to develop and extend the existing paradigm. In Kuhn’s words, ‘normal science does not aim at novelties of fact or theory, and when successful finds none’. Above all, Kuhn stressed that normal scientists are not trying to test the paradigm. On the contrary, they accept the paradigm unquestioningly, and conduct their research within the limits it sets. If a normal scientist gets an experimental result which conflicts with the paradigm, they will usually assume that their experimental technique is faulty, not that the paradigm is wrong.",
		"The most advanced military jets are fly‑by‑wire: They are so unstable that they require an automated system that can sense and act more quickly than a human operator to maintain control. Our dependence on smart technology has led to a paradox. As technology improves, it becomes more reliable and more efficient, and human operators depend on it even more. Eventually they lose focus, become distracted, and check out, leaving the system to run on its own. In the most extreme case, piloting a massive airliner could become a passive occupation, like watching TV. This is fine until something unexpected happens. The unexpected reveals the value of humans; what we bring to the table is the flexibility to handle new situations. Machines aren’t collaborating in pursuit of a joint goal; they are merely serving as tools. So when the human operator gives up oversight, the system is more likely to have a serious accident.",
		"Adam Smith pointed out that specialization, where each of us focuses on one specific skill, leads to a general improvement of everybody’s well‐being. The idea is simple and powerful. By specializing in just one activity―such as food raising, clothing production, or home construction― each worker gains mastery over the particular activity. Specialization makes sense, however, only if the specialist can subsequently trade his or her output with the output of specialists in other lines of activity. It would make no sense to produce more food than a household needs unless there is a market outlet to exchange that excess food for clothing, shelter, and so forth. At the same time, without the ability to buy food on the market, it would not be possible to be a specialist home builder or clothing maker, since it would be necessary to farm for one’s own survival. Thus Smith realized that the division of labor is limited by the extent of the market, whereas the extent of the market is determined by the degree of specialization.",
		"Countershading is the process of optical flattening that provides camouflage to animals. When sunlight illuminates an object from above, the object will be brightest on top. The color of the object will gradually shade darker toward the bottom. This shading gives the object depth and allows the viewer to distinguish its shape. Thus even if an animal is exactly, but uniformly, the same color as the substrate, it will be easily visible when illuminated. Most animals, however, are darker above than they are below. When they are illuminated from above, the darker back is lightened and the lighter belly is shaded. The animal thus appears to be a single color and easily blends in with the substrate. This pattern of coloration, or countershading, destroys the visual impression of shape in the organism. It allows the animal to blend in with its background.",
		"Robert Blattberg and Steven Hoch noted that, in a changing environment, it is not clear that consistency is always a virtue and that one of the advantages of human judgment is the ability to detect change. Thus, in changing environments, it might be advantageous to combine human judgment and statistical models. Blattberg and Hoch examined this possibility by having supermarket managers forecast demand for certain products and then creating a composite forecast by averaging these judgments with the forecasts of statistical models based on past data. The logic was that statistical models assume stable conditions and therefore cannot account for the effects on demand of novel events such as actions taken by competitors or the introduction of new products. Humans, however, can incorporate these novel factors in their judgments. The composite─or average of human judgments and statistical models─proved to be more accurate than either the statistical models or the managers working alone.",
		"Over the past several decades, there have been some agreements to reduce the debt of poor nations, but other economic challenges (like trade barriers) remain. Nontariff trade measures, such as quotas, subsidies, and restrictions on exports, are increasingly prevalent and may be enacted for policy reasons having nothing to do with trade. However, they have a discriminatory effect on exports from countries that lack the resources to comply with requirements of nontariff measures imposed by rich nations. For example, the huge subsidies that rich nations give to their farmers make it very difficult for farmers in the rest of the world to compete with them. Another example would be domestic health or safety regulations, which, though not specifically targeting imports, could impose significant costs on foreign manufacturers seeking to conform to the importer’s market. Industries in developing markets may have more difficulty absorbing these additional costs.",
		"The “jolt” of caffeine does wear off. Caffeine is removed from your system by an enzyme within your liver, which gradually degrades it over time. Based in large part on genetics, some people have a more efficient version of the enzyme that degrades caffeine, allowing the liver to rapidly clear it from the bloodstream. These rare individuals can drink an espresso with dinner and fall fast asleep at midnight without a problem. Others, however, have a slower­acting version of the enzyme. It takes far longer for their system to eliminate the same amount of caffeine. As a result, they are very sensitive to caffeine’s effects. One cup of tea or coffee in the morning will last much of the day, and should they have a second cup, even early in the afternoon, they will find it difficult to fall asleep in the evening. Aging also alters the speed of caffeine clearance: the older we are, the longer it takes our brain and body to remove caffeine, and thus the more sensitive we become in later life to caffeine’s sleep-­disrupting influence.",
		"Technology changes how individuals and societies understand the concept of privacy. The fact that someone has a new ability to access information or watch the actions of another does not justify doing so. Rather, advances in technology require citizens and policy makers to consider how privacy protections should be expanded. For example, when cameras first became available for commercial and private use, nations and citizens struggled over whether new laws should be enacted to protect individuals from being photographed without their permission. The reconsideration of privacy brought about by this new technology re-affirmed a distinction between private and public spaces. It was determined by most cultures that people automatically gave consent to being seen―and thus recorded ―once they voluntarily stepped into a public space. Although some people might be uncomfortable with the spread of surveillance cameras, citizens in most cultures have adjusted to the fact that giving up the right not to be observed in these circumstances causes less harm to the community than failing to have surveillance.",
		"Emotion socialization—learning from other people about emotions and how to deal with them—starts early in life and plays a foundational role for emotion regulation development. Although extra­familial influences, such as peers or media, gain in importance during adolescence, parents remain the primary socialization agents. For example, their own responses to emotional situations serve as a role model for emotion regulation, increasing the likelihood that their children will show similar reactions in comparable situations. Parental practices at times when their children are faced with emotional challenges also impact emotion regulation development. Whereas direct soothing and directive guidance of what to do are beneficial for younger children, they may intrude on adolescents’ autonomy striving. In consequence, adolescents might pull away from, rather than turn toward, their parents in times of emotional crisis, unless parental practices are adjusted. More suitable in adolescence is indirect support of autonomous emotion regulation, such as through interest in, as well as awareness and nonjudgmental acceptance of, adolescents’ emotional experiences, and being available when the adolescent wants to talk.",
		"In the 1970s, when schools began allowing students to use portable calculators, many parents objected. They worried that a reliance on the machines would weaken their children’s grasp of mathematical concepts. The fears, subsequent studies showed, were largely unneeded. No longer forced to spend a lot of time on routine calculations, many students gained a deeper understanding of the principles underlying their exercises. Today, the story of the calculator is often used to support the argument that our growing dependence on online databases is advantageous. In freeing us from the work of remembering, it’s said, the Web allows us to devote more time to creative thought. The pocket calculator relieved the pressure on our working memory, letting us use that critical short-term store for more abstract reasoning. The calculator, a powerful but highly specialized tool, turned out to be an aid to our working memory.",
		"Whether an animal can feel anything resembling the loneliness humans feel is hard to say. However, highly social animals, such as certain types of parrot, seem to be adversely affected when kept alone. Some parrots will engage in bizarre behaviors and can severely harm themselves. Some large parrots will even seem to go insane if subjected to long periods of  isolation. On the other hand, certain animals that are by nature solitary hardly appear to be affected at all. Some fish, in particular some types of cichlids, will even fight viciously with their own kind if more than one is kept in an aquarium. Guam rails, a kind of flightless bird, are intolerant of their own kind, which has obviously made breeding them in captivity very difficult.",
		"A special feature of the real estate rental market is its tendency to undergo a severe and prolonged contraction phase, more so than with manufactured products. When the supply of a manufactured product exceeds the demand, the manufacturer cuts back on output, and the merchant reduces inventory to balance supply and demand. However, property owners cannot reduce the amount of space available for rent in their buildings. Space that was constructed to accommodate business and consumer needs at the peak of the cycle remains, so vacancy rates climb and the downward trend becomes more severe. Rental rates generally do not drop below a certain point, the minimum that must be charged in order to cover operating expenses. Some owners will take space off the market rather than lose money on it. A few, unable to subsidize the property, will sell at distress prices, and lenders will repossess others. These may then be placed on the market at lower rental rates, further depressing the market.",
		"We’re all told at school that white reflects sunlight and black absorbs it, so the paler your clothes are, the cooler you’ll be. But it’s not quite that simple. In many hot countries, locals often wear dark colors. Peasants in China and old ladies in southern Europe, for instance, traditionally wear black, and the Tuareg, the nomadic people of the Sahara, favor indigo blue. These clothes are effective because there are two thermal processes happening at once. Heat is coming downwards from the sun but it is also going outwards from the body. Though light clothes are better at reflecting the sun’s heat, dark clothes are better at radiating the body’s heat. Given that no one born in a hot climate willingly stands in direct sunlight, the dark clothing has the edge because it keeps you cooler when you’re in the shade.",
		"The dominance of conclusions over arguments is most pronounced where emotions are involved. The psychologist Paul Slovic has proposed a theory in which people let their likes and dislikes determine their beliefs about the world. Your political preference determines the arguments that you find compelling. If you like the current health policy, you believe its benefits are substantial and its costs more manageable than the costs of alternatives. If you are a hawk in your attitude toward other nations, you probably think they are relatively weak and likely to submit to your country’s will. If you are a dove, you probably think they are strong and will not be easily persuaded. Your emotional attitude to such things as red meat, nuclear power, tattoos, or motorcycles drives your beliefs about their benefits and their risks. If you dislike any of these things, you probably believe that its risks are high and its benefits negligible.",
		"An Egyptian executive, after entertaining his Canadian guest, offered him joint partnership in a new business venture. The Canadian, delighted with the offer, suggested that they meet again the next morning with their respective lawyers to finalize the details. The Egyptian never showed up. The surprised and disappointed Canadian tried to understand what had gone wrong: Did Egyptians lack punctuality? Was the Egyptian expecting a counter-offer? Were lawyers unavailable in Cairo? None of these explanations proved to be correct; rather, the problem was caused by the different meaning Canadians and Egyptians attach to inviting lawyers. The Canadian regarded the lawyers’ presence as facilitating the successful completion of the negotiation; the Egyptian interpreted it as signaling the Canadian’s mistrust of his verbal commitment. Canadians often use the impersonal formality of a lawyer’s services to finalize agreements. Egyptians, by contrast, more frequently depend on the personal relationship between bargaining partners to accomplish the same purpose.",
		"The basic task of the preschool years is to establish a sense of competence and initiative. The core struggle is between initiative and guilt. Preschool children begin to initiate many of their own activities as they become physically and psychologically ready to engage in pursuits of their own choosing. If they are allowed realistic freedom to make some of their own decisions, they tend to develop a positive orientation characterized by confidence in their ability to initiate and follow through. If their choices are ridiculed, however, they tend to experience a sense of guilt and ultimately to withdraw from taking an active stance. One middle­aged woman we talked with still finds herself extremely vulnerable to being seen as foolish. She recalls that during her childhood family members laughed at her attempts to perform certain tasks. She took in certain messages she received from her family, and these messages greatly influenced her attitudes and actions. Even now she vividly carries these pictures in her head, and these messages continue to control her life.",
		"One reason conversational life can lack depth and excitement is that we easily fall into using formulaic questions to open a dialogue―How are you? What was the weather like? What do you do? How was your weekend? Although such questions can be important social lubricants, in themselves they generally fail to spark an engaging and enriching empathic exchange. We answer “Fine” or “OK,” then move on down the corridor. The way a conversation begins can be a major determinant of where it goes. So it is worth experimenting with adventurous openings. Instead of greeting a workmate with “How are things?” try taking your conversation in a different direction with something mildly unusual like, “What have you been thinking about this morning?” or “What was the most surprising thing that happened to you over the weekend?” You need to come up with the kinds of questions that suit your own personality. The point is to break conventions so your conversations become energizing, memorable, and vehicles for empathic discovery.",
		"There is a reason that prey animals form foraging groups, and that is increased vigilance. An individual redshank is faced with a choice when feeding. It could spend all of its time being vigilant, looking out for approaching predators. If it did so, it would certainly significantly reduce the chance that it would be taken by surprise, but it would also starve. A bird with its head in the air scanning for predators cannot at the same time have its head down searching for food. In reality of course an individual balances the two behaviors in accordance with the situation in which it finds itself, and as a member of a group it can shift the balance towards feeding. The bigger the flock of birds, the less time an individual bird devotes to vigilance. This is possible because the presence of many sets of eyes in the flock effectively means that there is always somebody on the look out.",
		"The repairman is called in when the smooth operation of our world has been disrupted, and at such moments our dependence on things normally taken for granted (for example, a toilet that flushes) is brought to vivid awareness. For this very reason, the repairman’s presence may make the narcissist uncomfortable. The problem isn’t so much that he is dirty or the job is messy. Rather, he seems to pose a challenge to our self­understanding that is somehow fundamental. We’re not as free and independent as we thought. Street­level work that disrupts the infrastructure (the sewer system below or the electrical grid above) brings our shared dependence into view. People may inhabit very different worlds even in the same city, according to their wealth or poverty. Yet we all live in the same physical reality, ultimately, and owe a common debt to the world.",
		"Most people are confident that creativity is an individual possession, not a collective phenomenon. Despite some notable collaborations in the arts and sciences, the most impressive acts of creative thought―from Archimedes to Jane Austen―appear to have been the products of individuals (and often isolated and eccentric individuals who reject commonly held beliefs). I think that this perception is something of an illusion, however. It cannot be denied that the primary source of novelty lies in the recombination of information within the individual brain. But I suspect that as individuals, we would and could accomplish little in the way of creative thinking outside the context of the super­brain, the integration of individual brains. The heads of Archimedes, Jane Austen, and all the other original thinkers who stretch back into the Middle Stone Age in Africa were connected with the thoughts of others from early childhood onward, including the ideas of those long dead or unknown. How could they have created without the collective constructions of mathematics, language, and art?",
		"Sometimes the awareness that one is distrusted can provide the necessary incentive for self-reflection. An employee who realizes she isn’t being trusted by her co-workers with shared responsibilities at work might, upon reflection, identify areas where she has consistently let others down or failed to follow through on previous commitments. Others’ distrust of her might then motivate her to perform her share of the duties in a way that makes her more worthy of their trust. But distrust of one who is sincere in her efforts to be a trustworthy and dependable person can be disorienting and might cause her to doubt her own perceptions and to distrust herself. Consider, for instance, a teenager whose parents are suspicious and distrustful when she goes out at night; even if she has been forthright about her plans and is not breaking any agreed-upon rules, her identity as a respectable moral subject is undermined by a pervasive parental attitude that expects deceit and betrayal.",
		"One misconception that often appears in the writings of physical scientists who are looking at biology from the outside is that the environment appears to them to be a static entity, which cannot contribute new bits of information as evolution progresses. This, however, is by no means the case. Far from being static, the environment is constantly changing and offering new challenges to evolving populations. For higher organisms, the most significant changes in the environment are those produced by the contemporaneous evolution of other organisms. The evolution of a horse’s hoof from a five-toed foot has enabled the horse to gallop rapidly over open plains. But such galloping is of no advantage to a horse unless it is being chased by a predator. The horse’s efficient mechanism for running would never have evolved except for the fact that meat-eating predators were at the same time evolving more efficient methods of attack. Consequently, laws based upon ecological relationships among different kinds of organisms are essential for understanding evolution and the diversity of life to which it has given rise.",
		"Random errors may be detected by repeating the measurements. Furthermore, by taking more and more readings, we obtain from the arithmetic mean a value which approaches more and more closely to the true value. Neither of these points is true for a systematic error. Repeated measurements with the same apparatus neither reveal nor do they eliminate a systematic error. For this reason systematic errors are potentially more dangerous than random errors. If large random errors are present in an experiment, they will manifest themselves in a large value of the final quoted error. Thus everyone is aware of the imprecision of the result, and no harm is done―except possibly to the ego of the experimenter when no one takes notice of his or her results. However, the concealed presence of a systematic error may lead to an apparently reliable result, given with a small estimated error, which is in fact seriously wrong.",
		"Chunking is vital for cognition of music. If we had to encode it in our brains note by note, we’d struggle to make sense of anything more complex than the simplest children’s songs. Of course, most accomplished musicians can play compositions containing many thousands of notes entirely from memory, without a note out of place. But this seemingly awesome accomplishment of recall is made possible by remembering the musical process, not the individual notes as such. If you ask a pianist to start a Mozart sonata from bar forty-one, she’ll probably have to mentally replay the music from the start until reaching that bar―the score is not simply laid out in her mind, to be read from any random point. It’s rather like describing how you drive to work: you don’t simply recite the names of roads as an abstract list, but have to construct your route by mentally retracing it. When musicians make a mistake during rehearsal, they wind back to the start of a musical phrase (‘let’s take it from the second verse’) before restarting.",
		"At a time when concerns about overpopulation and famine were reaching their highest peak, Garrett Hardin did not blame these problems on human ignorance―a failure to take note of dwindling per capita food supplies, for example. Instead, his explanation focused on the discrepancy between the interests of individual households and those of society as a whole. To understand excessive reproduction as a tragedy of the commons, bear in mind that a typical household stands to gain from bringing another child into the world―in terms of the net contributions he or she makes to household earnings, for example. But while parents can be counted on to assess how the well­being of their household is affected by additional offspring, they overlook other impacts of population growth, such as diminished per capita food supplies for other people. In other words, the costs of reproduction are largely shared, rather than being shouldered entirely by individual households. As a result, reproduction is excessive.",
		"If I say to you, ‘Don’t think of a white bear’, you will find it difficult not to think of a white bear. In this way, ‘thought suppression can actually increase the thoughts one wishes to suppress instead of calming them’. One common example of this is that people on a diet who try not to think about food often begin to think much more about food. This process is therefore also known as the rebound effect. The ironic effect seems to be caused by the interplay of two related cognitive processes. This dual-process system involves, first, an intentional operating process, which consciously attempts to locate thoughts unrelated to the suppressed ones. Second, and simultaneously, an unconscious monitoring process tests whether the operating system is functioning effectively. If the monitoring system encounters thoughts inconsistent with the intended ones, it prompts the intentional operating process to ensure that these are replaced by appropriate thoughts. However, it is argued, the intentional operating system can fail due to increased cognitive load caused by fatigue, stress and emotional factors, and so the monitoring process filters the inappropriate thoughts into consciousness, making them highly accessible.",
		"In collectivist groups, there is considerable emphasis on relationships, the maintenance of harmony, and “sticking with” the group. Members of collectivist groups are socialized to avoid conflict, to empathize with others, and to avoid drawing attention to themselves. In contrast, members of individualist cultures tend to define themselves in terms of their independence from groups and autonomy and are socialized to value individual freedoms and individual expressions. In individualist cultures, standing out and being different is often seen as a sign of courage. Implicit in the characterization of collectivist and individualist groups is the assumption that deviance will be downgraded more in groups that prescribe collectivism than in groups that prescribe individualism. Indeed, empirical research shows that individualist group norms broaden the latitude of acceptable group member behavior and non­normative characteristics.",
		"Those who limit themselves to Western scientific research have virtually ignored anything that cannot be perceived by the five senses and repeatedly measured or quantified. Research is dismissed as superstitious and invalid if it cannot be scientifically explained by cause and effect. Many continue to cling with an almost religious passion to this cultural paradigm about the power of science⸻more specifically, the power that science gives them. By dismissing non­Western scientific paradigms as inferior at best and inaccurate at worst, the most rigid members of the conventional medical research community try to counter the threat that alternative therapies and research pose to their work, their well­being, and their worldviews. And yet, biomedical research cannot explain many of the phenomena that concern alternative practitioners regarding caring­healing processes. When therapies such as acupuncture or homeopathy are observed to result in a physiological or clinical response that cannot be explained by the biomedical model, many have tried to deny the results rather than modify the scientific model.",
		"It’s likely that for a very long time people managed to survive with draped animal pelts and then began roughly sewing these together. Ultimately, though, the advantages of using woven fabric for clothing would have become obvious. A fur pelt offers adequate thermal protection if someone is sitting still, but once on the move or in strong winds, this is less true, because pelts aren’t shaped close to the body. The more air gets between the body and the clothing, the less effective it is at trapping an insulating layer of air close to the skin. In fact, the insulating properties of clothing decrease very much when walking quickly. Clothing also needs to be breathable, because damp clothes are bad at keeping the wearer warm and become very heavy. Woven fabrics are more breathable than fur and, when specifically tailored to the body, make excellent internal layers, preventing cold air from getting direct access to the skin’s surface. Thus the ability to create woven clothing would have offered material advantages to our early ancestors once they had left Africa for cooler areas.",
		"Sport can trigger an emotional response in its consumers of the kind rarely brought forth by other products. Imagine bank customers buying memorabilia to show loyalty to their bank, or consumers identifying so strongly with their car insurance company that they get a tattoo with its logo. We know that some sport followers are so passionate about players, teams and the sport itself that their interest borders on obsession. This addiction provides the emotional glue that binds fans to teams, and maintains loyalty even in the face of on-field failure. While most managers can only dream of having customers that are as passionate about their products as sport fans, the emotion triggered by sport can also have a negative impact. Sport’s emotional intensity can mean that organisations have strong attachments to the past through nostalgia and club tradition. As a result, they may ignore efficiency, productivity and the need to respond quickly to changing market conditions. For example, a proposal to change club colours in order to project a more attractive image may be defeated because it breaks a link with tradition.",
		"Prior to the Industrial Revolution, the quantity of freight transported between nations was negligible by contemporary standards. For instance, during the Middle Ages, the totality of French imports via the Saint­Gothard Passage would not fill a freight train. The amount of freight transported by the Venetian fleet, which dominated Mediterranean trade, would not fill a modern container ship. The volume, but not the speed, of trade improved under mercantilism, notably for maritime transportation. In spite of all, distribution capacities were very limited and speeds slow. For example, a stagecoach going through the English countryside in the sixteenth century had an average speed of 2 miles per hour; moving one ton of cargo 30 miles inland in the United States by the late eighteenth century was as costly as moving it across the Atlantic. The inland transportation system was thus very limited. By the late eighteenth century, canal systems started to emerge in Europe. They permitted the large movements of bulk freight inland and expanded regional trade. Maritime and riverine transportation were consequently the dominant modes of the pre-­industrial era.",
		"In economic systems what takes place in one sector has impacts on another; demand for a good or service in one sector is derived from another. For instance, a consumer buying a good in a store will likely trigger the replacement of this product, which will generate demands for activities such as manufacturing, resource extraction and, of course, transport. What is different about transport is that it cannot exist alone and a movement cannot be stored. An unsold product can remain on the shelf of a store until bought (often with discount incentives), but an unsold seat on a flight or unused cargo capacity in the same flight remains unsold and cannot be brought back as additional capacity later. In this case an opportunity has been missed, since the amount of transport being offered has exceeded the demand for it. The derived demand of transportation is often very difficult to reconcile with an equivalent supply, and actually transport companies would prefer to have some additional capacity to accommodate unforeseen demand (often at much higher prices).",
		"How people behave often depends on what others do. If other car drivers or subway users leave for work at 8 a.m., it may be to my advantage to leave at 6 a.m., even if that is really too early from my point of view. In equilibrium, flows stabilize so that each person makes the best trade­off between their ideal schedule and the congestion they will suffer on their commute. In making such choices, agents seek to differentiate their behavior from that of others. On other occasions, agents have a problem with coordination. They would like to choose to behave the same way as others. For example, if most of my fellow citizens did not pay their parking tickets, there would be (unfortunately) strong pressure for an amnesty for such offenders, which would decrease my incentive to pay my parking tickets too. There may be multiple equilibria, so that two otherwise identical societies may adopt different behavioral patterns.",
		"Just as there’s a tendency to glorify technological progress, there’s a countertendency to expect the worst of every new tool or machine. In Plato’s Phaedrus, Socrates bemoaned the development of writing. He feared that, as people came to rely on the written word as a substitute for the knowledge they used to carry inside their heads, they would, in the words of one of the dialogue’s characters, “cease to exercise their memory and become forgetful.” And because they would be able to “receive a quantity of information without proper instruction,” they would “be thought very knowledgeable when they are for the most part quite ignorant.” They would be “filled with the conceit of wisdom instead of real wisdom.” Socrates wasn’t wrong─ the new technology did often have the effects he feared─ but he was shortsighted. He couldn’t foresee the many ways that writing and reading would serve to spread information, spark fresh ideas, and expand human knowledge (if not wisdom).",
		"One of the most productive strategies to build customer relationships is to increase the firm’s share of customer rather than its market share. This strategy involves abandoning the old notions of acquiring new customers and increasing transactions to focus instead on more fully serving the needs of existing customers. Financial services are a great example of this. Most consumers purchase financial services from different firms. They bank at one institution, purchase insurance from another, and handle their investments elsewhere. To counter this purchasing pattern, many companies now offer all of these services under one roof. For example, Regions Financial Corporation offers retail and commercial banking, trust, mortgage, and insurance products to customers in a network of more than 1,500 offices. The company tries to more fully serve the financial needs of its current customers, thereby acquiring a larger share of each customer’s financial business. By creating these types of relationships, customers have little incentive to seek out competitive firms to fulfill their financial services needs.",
		"In recent years urban transport professionals globally have largely acquiesced to the view that automobile demand in cities needs to be managed rather than accommodated. Rising incomes inevitably lead to increases in motorization. Even without the imperative of climate change, the physical constraints of densely inhabited cities and the corresponding demands of accessibility, mobility, safety, air pollution, and urban livability all limit the option of expanding road networks purely to accommodate this rising demand. As a result, as cities develop and their residents become more prosperous, persuading people to choose not to use cars becomes an increasingly key focus of city managers and planners. Improving the quality of alternative options, such as walking, cycling, and public transport, is a central element of this strategy. However, the most direct approach to managing automobile demand is making motorized travel more expensive or restricting it with administrative rules. The contribution of motorized travel to climate change reinforces this imperative.",
		"In poorer countries many years of fast growth may be necessary to bring living standards up to acceptable levels. But growth is the means to achieve desired goals, not the end in itself. In the richer world the whole idea of growth─ at least as conventionally measured─may need to be revised. In economies where services dominate, goods and services tailored to our individual needs will be what determine the advance of our societies. These could be anything from genome­specific medicines to personalized care or tailored suits. That is different from more and more stuff, an arms race of growth. Instead, it means improvements in quality, something that GDP is ill equipped to measure. Some fifty years ago one US economist contrasted what he called the “cowboy” economy, bent on production, exploitation of resources, and pollution, with the “spaceman” economy, in which quality and complexity replaced “throughput” as the measure of success. The move from manufacturing to services and from analog to digital is the shift from cowboy to spaceman. But we are still measuring the size of the lasso.",
		"Although the wonders of modern technology have provided people with opportunities beyond the wildest dreams of our ancestors, the good, as usual, is weakened by a downside. One of those downsides is that anyone who so chooses can pick up the virtual megaphone that is the Internet and put in their two cents on any of an infinite number of topics, regardless of their qualifications. After all, on the Internet, there are no regulations preventing a kindergarten teacher from offering medical advice or a physician from suggesting ways to safely make structural changes to your home. As a result, misinformation gets disseminated as information, and it is not always easy to differentiate the two. This can be particularly frustrating for scientists, who spend their lives learning how to understand the intricacies of the world around them, only to have their work summarily challenged by people whose experience with the topic can be measured in minutes. This frustration is then amplified by the fact that, to the general public, both the scientist and the challenger are awarded equal credibility.",
		"Musical performers and their labor union did not perceive early recordings as a threat to their livelihoods because the recordings were mostly of poor quality. It was not long before musicians began to wonder whether recordings of popular artists or songs would undermine the demand for live music. For a time, however, recorded music was too scratchy to pose a serious threat, even though it played in commercial places and offered a few performers a way to supplement their income. Additionally, during the early days of recording, radio stations preferred using live musicians on their programs. Sound from live performances was better quality, and stations at this time rarely used recordings. Broadcasters respected union demands for employment and decent wages, because the alterative use of recordings was even less attractive. They made efforts to employ orchestras, bands, and vocalists to perform on radio programs. There was relative balance between live music and technology in the early innovation stages. With increased improvements in electrical recording, however, this balance soon changed.",
		"In centuries past, we might learn much about life from the wisdom of our elders. Today, the majority of the messages we receive about how to live a good life come not from Granny’s long experience of the world, but from advertising executives hoping to sell us products. If we are satisfied with our lives, we will not feel a burning desire to purchase anything, and then the economy may collapse. But if we are unsatisfied, and any of the products we buy actually delivers the promised lasting fulfillment, subsequent sales figures may likewise drop. We exist in a fog of messaging designed explicitly to influence our behavior. Not surprisingly, our behavior often shifts in precisely the manner intended. If you can be made to feel sufficiently inferior due to your yellowed teeth, perhaps you will rush to the pharmacy to purchase whitening strips. The lack of any research whatsoever correlating tooth shade with life satisfaction is never mentioned. Having been told one hundred times a day how to be happy, we spend much of our lives buying the necessary accoutrements and feeling disappointed not to discover life satisfaction inside the packaging.",
		"How do hormones trigger reactions in the body? When a hormone is released from a gland, it travels in the bloodstream through the body in search of its target. Organs, tissues and other glands in the body have receptor sites that hormones must bind to in order to deliver their message and cause an effect. But because every hormone has its own unique shape, they are designed to act only on the parts of the body that have a receptor site with the corresponding shape. This mode of action can be likened to a lock and key mechanism―if the key doesn’t fit the lock, then nothing will happen. When a hormone binds to its receptor, it sets off a chain of other signaling pathways to create a change in the body. Once the desired effect has taken place and there is too much hormone circulating in the blood, this signal is fed back to the glands to suppress further hormone release. This is called a feedback loop and, when functioning correctly, it allows the endocrine system to ensure the conditions in your body remain in balance.",
		"The consequences of the mechanical breakdown of food by cooking are profound. Both the stiffness and toughness of the food is drastically reduced, making mechanical processing far easier. The forces your teeth need to apply to break up the food are lower, and the food releases its cell contents far more easily. The optimal tooth shape for breaking up the food also changes. Rather than needing thick, flat plates that can apply large compression forces to grind up tough materials and crush hard ones, it is better to have molars with pointed ends to cut through the softer food. It loosens at much lower forces and breaks up far more quickly. Modern hunter­gatherers spend far less time chewing their food even than apes that eat relatively soft fruit; they chew for less than an hour a day compared with five or six hours for chimpanzees. This frees up plenty of time for other tasks, such as looking after the fire, making a permanent camp, toolmaking, or further foraging.",
		"Why is the value of place so important? From a historical perspective, until the 1700s textile production was a hand process using the fibers available within a particular geographic region, for example, cotton, wool, silk, and flax. Trade among regions increased the availability of these fibers and associated textiles made from the fibers. The First Industrial Revolution and subsequent technological advancements in manufactured fibers added to the fact that fibers and textiles were no longer “place-bound.” Fashion companies created and consumers could acquire textiles and products made from textiles with little or no connection to where, how, or by whom the products were made. This resulted in a disconnect between consumers and the products they use on a daily basis, a loss of understanding and appreciation in the skills and resources necessary to create these products, and an associated disregard for the human and natural resources necessary for the products’ creation. Therefore, renewing a value on place reconnects the company and the consumer with the people, geography, and culture of a particular location.",
		"Technology has historically distinguished the way music is produced. In a live jazz concert a bass player can provide the audience with a ten­minute jam session but is unable to do so if making a record. Time and space limits on early discs made this liberalized performance style impossible. Often, pieces would be separated into a number of discs leading to a lack of continuity. In addition to length, musicians had to take into account how the machinery recorded and absorbed their sound. Especially in the early days of recording, human voices as well as instruments were often distorted once recorded. To prevent such distortion, it was up to the musician to alter the sound to accommodate the recording technology that was just coming into existence. Jazz musicians and orchestras almost molded their works around recording parameters. Many musicians were receptive to the limitations and benefits of technology and created their records accordingly. The recording limitations began to filter into stage performance. Musicians were restricted to three­minute songs in the recording studio and they soon kept their songs to that length on stage too.",
		"While it has been found that young children rely exclusively on geometric information to determine the location of an object hidden in a small enclosure, exclusive use of geometry does not occur in larger spaces. Although, in a small room, children failed to incorporate information about nongeometric features (i.e., a blue wall), they used both types of information in a larger room. These findings suggest that geometric and nongeometric information may be combined in a weighted fashion. Geometry may be privileged because it is more stable across time than is nongeometric information. Whether or not nongeometric landmark information is combined with geometry may depend on the ecological validity of nongeometric features; for example, larger features may be more stable and hence more reliable. Further, a variety of mobile animals give more weight to nearer than to farther landmarks in estimation, consistent with Weber’s law in which smaller distances would be coded more accurately than larger distances.",
		"Some prominent journalists say that archaeologists should work with treasure hunters because treasure hunters have accumulated valuable historical artifacts that can reveal much about the past. But archaeologists are not asked to cooperate with tomb robbers, who also have valuable historical artifacts. The quest for profit and the search for knowledge cannot coexist in archaeology because of the time factor. Rather incredibly, one archaeologist employed by a treasure hunting firm said that as long as archaeologists are given six months to study shipwrecked artifacts before they are sold, no historical knowledge is lost! On the contrary, archaeologists and assistants from the INA (Institute of Nautical Archaeology) needed more than a decade of year-round conservation before they could even catalog all the finds from an eleventh-century AD wreck they had excavated. Then, to interpret those finds, they had to learn Russian, Bulgarian, and Romanian, without which they would never have learned the true nature of the site. Could a “commercial archaeologist” have waited more than a decade or so before selling the finds?",
		"Europe’s first Homo sapiens lived primarily on large game, particularly reindeer. Even under ideal circumstances, hunting these fast animals with spear or bow and arrow is an uncertain task. The reindeer, however, had a weakness that mankind would mercilessly exploit: it swam poorly. While afloat, it is uniquely vulnerable, moving slowly with its antlers held high as it struggles to keep its nose above water. At some point, a Stone Age genius realized the enormous hunting advantage he would gain by being able to glide over the water’s surface, and built the first boat. Once the easily overtaken and killed prey had been hauled aboard, getting its body back to the tribal camp would have been far easier by boat than on land. It would not have taken long for mankind to apply this advantage to other goods.",
		"Suppose we know that Paula suffers from a severe phobia. If we reason that Paula is afraid either of snakes or spiders, and then establish that she is not afraid of snakes, we will conclude that Paula is afraid of spiders. However, our conclusion is reasonable only if Paula’s fear really does concern either snakes or spiders. If we know only that Paula has a phobia, then the fact that she’s not afraid of snakes is entirely consistent with her being afraid of heights, water, dogs or the number thirteen. More generally, when we are presented with a list of alternative explanations for some phenomenon, and are then persuaded that all but one of those explanations are unsatisfactory, we should pause to reflect. Before conceding that the remaining explanation is the correct one, consider whether other plausible options are being ignored or overlooked. The fallacy of false choice misleads when we’re insufficiently attentive to an important hidden assumption, that the choices which have been made explicit exhaust the sensible alternatives.",
		"How the bandwagon effect occurs is demonstrated by the history of measurements of the speed of light. Because this speed is the basis of the theory of relativity, it’s one of the most frequently and carefully measured quantities in science. As far as we know, the speed hasn’t changed over time. However, from 1870 to 1900, all the experiments found speeds that were too high. Then, from 1900 to 1950, the opposite happened―all the experiments found speeds that were too low! This kind of error, where results are always on one side of the real value, is called “bias.” It probably happened because over time, experimenters subconsciously adjusted their results to match what they expected to find. If a result fit what they expected, they kept it. If a result didn’t fit, they threw it out. They weren’t being intentionally dishonest, just influenced by the conventional wisdom. The pattern only changed when someone had the courage to report what was actually measured instead of what was expected.",
		"It has been suggested that “organic” methods, defined as those in which only natural products can be used as inputs, would be less damaging to the biosphere. Large-scale adoption of “organic” farming methods, however, would reduce yields and increase production costs for many major crops. Inorganic nitrogen supplies are essential for maintaining moderate to high levels of productivity for many of the non-leguminous crop species, because organic supplies of nitrogenous materials often are either limited or more expensive than inorganic nitrogen fertilizers. In addition, there are constraints to the extensive use of either manure or legumes as “green manure” crops. In many cases, weed control can be very difficult or require much hand labor if chemicals cannot be used, and fewer people are willing to do this work as societies become wealthier. Some methods used in “organic” farming, however, such as the sensible use of crop rotations and specific combinations of cropping and livestock enterprises, can make important contributions to the sustainability of rural ecosystems.",
		"Everywhere we turn we hear about almighty “cyberspace”! The hype promises that we will leave our boring lives, put on goggles and body suits, and enter some metallic, three-dimensional, multimedia otherworld. When the Industrial Revolution arrived with its great innovation, the motor, we didn’t leave our world to go to some remote motorspace! On the contrary, we brought the motors into our lives, as automobiles, refrigerators, drill presses, and pencil sharpeners. This absorption has been so complete that we refer to all these tools with names that declare their usage, not their “motorness.” These innovations led to a major socioeconomic movement precisely because they entered and affected profoundly our everyday lives. People have not changed fundamentally in thousands of years. Technology changes constantly. It’s the one that must adapt to us. That’s exactly what will happen with information technology and its devices under human-centric computing. The longer we continue to believe that computers will take us to a magical new world, the longer we will delay their natural fusion with our lives, the hallmark of every major movement that aspires to be called a socioeconomic revolution.",
		"Bazaar economies feature an apparently flexible price-setting mechanism that sits atop more enduring ties of shared culture. Both the buyer and seller are aware of each other’s restrictions. In Delhi’s bazaars, buyers and sellers can assess to a large extent the financial constraints that other actors have in their everyday life. Each actor belonging to a specific economic class understands what the other sees as a necessity and a luxury. In the case of electronic products like video games, they are not a necessity at the same level as other household purchases such as food items. So, the seller in Delhi’s bazaars is careful not to directly ask for very high prices for video games because at no point will the buyer see possession of them as an absolute necessity. Access to this type of knowledge establishes a price consensus by relating to each other’s preferences and limitations of belonging to a similar cultural and economic universe.",
		"Because no plane, train or car could accommodate Sharyn’s delicate health needs, she had no other choice but to stay home while the rest of the family attended her son’s wedding without her. They left her with tender promises to remember all the details, to take lots and lots of pictures, and to save her some wedding cake. During her family’s absence, caregivers took care of her meals and personal needs, but Sharyn couldn’t shake off her blues and feelings of isolation. It wasn’t easy finding herself apart from her family at Christmas and missing the festivities of her son’s wedding. The hurt followed her as surely as the oxygen tube trailing her wheelchair.",
		"Ester awoke one morning to the sound of a heavily pouring April shower. She looked out her window and saw the rain slowly beginning to fade. A brilliant curved arc of colors crossed the sky. It was a beautiful rainbow. Ester leaped from her bed with delight, dashed into the living room, and shouted, “Mom, come here. Look at this beautiful rainbow! It is gorgeous!” “Ester, calm down,” her mother said, as she followed her daughter to the window where she could see the rainbow. And there it was! A brilliance of beautiful colors that lit up the sky! It was the first rainbow that Ester had ever seen.",
		"The match finished over an hour ago and there is no need for me to feel especially under pressure. I am tired, physically and emotionally, and I sit down to enjoy a cold drink, trying to make myself comfortable. But for some reason, I can’t switch off. In my mind I go over every decision I made. I wonder what other referees will think of how I did. I am concerned about having made mistakes, and the objections of the spectators are still ringing in my ears. I keep telling myself: “Forget the game,” “My colleagues and I agreed on everything,” “On the whole, I did a good job.” And yet there are still concerns despite all my efforts to brush them aside.",
		"My dog, Pinky, was a handful. But Pinky and I loved each other. Every day when I got off the school bus she’d bark, race to the end of her run and try to jump over the gate to greet me. That’s why I knew something was terribly wrong that afternoon last spring. Not a sound. Pinky’s run was empty. I searched the streets until my feet ached. No Pinky. None of my neighbors had seen her either. The next day I called the animal shelters. I examined the “dog found” ads in the paper. There were lots of them, but none matched my Pinky’s description. “Don’t worry,” Mom said. “We will put up lost dog signs and keep looking.” We checked the neighborhood for six days. Still Pinky didn’t turn up.",
		"I heard something moving slowly along the walls. I searched for a match in the dark and tried to strike it, but it wouldn’t light. This time I was certain: Something was moving in the tunnels, something alive, and it wasn’t a rat. A very unpleasant smell came into my nostrils. Finally, I managed to light a match. At first I was blinded by the flame; then I saw something creeping toward me. From all the tunnels. Shapeless figures crawling like spiders. The match fell from my trembling fingers. I wanted to start running, but I couldn’t.",
		"Charlie knew something was wrong. The lake was gone. He paused and scanned the field, but he could not see anything familiar. Suddenly a dog barked behind him. The sound, unexpected and loud, startled him, so he began to run away. Then another dog was barking, and another, and he had no idea where the dogs were. He was terribly frightened and he ran with increasing awkwardness, tearing at the weeds with his hands, pulling at the air, so that everything about him seemed to be running except his slow feet. The sound of the dogs seemed to be all around him, even getting louder.",
		"The mountain shelter had four walls, with an opening about five feet wide in the front wall. I picked a spot in a corner. Other hikers arrived; it would be a full house tonight. It was seven o’clock and the start of one of the worst nights of my life. When I crawled into my sleeping bag, my underwear was still moist after sweating so much on the difficult climbs of the day, and none of my other clothing was dry. I could not ignore another inconvenience, either: the air movement brought to the surface all the smells of bodies and wet sleeping bags. Lying on the floor in the corner of the crowded shelter, surrounded by bad smells, I could not fall asleep.",
		"Clara, an 11-year-old girl, sat in the back seat of her mother’s car with the window down. The wind from outside blew her brown hair across her ivory pale skin―she sighed deeply. She was sad about moving and was not smiling. Her heart felt like it hurt. The fact that she had to leave everything she knew broke her heart. Eleven years―that was a long time to be in one place and build memories and make friends. She had been able to finish out the school year with her friends, which was nice, but she feared she would face the whole summer and the coming school year alone. Clara sighed heavily.",
		"Annemarie looked up, panting, just as she reached the corner. Her heart seemed to skip a beat. “Halte!” the soldier ordered in a stern voice. The German word was as familiar as it was scary. Annemarie had heard it often enough before, but it had never been directed at her until now. Behind her, Ellen also slowed and stopped. Annemarie stared up. There were two of them. That meant two helmets, two sets of cold eyes glaring at her, and four tall shiny boots planted firmly on the sidewalk, blocking her path to home. And it meant two guns, gripped in the hands of the soldiers. She was motionless as she stared at the guns.",
		"Sunset was late in coming. It had been a hot sunny day and the air was heavy and still. I saw a large fountain in the middle of the town square but there was no water. The square was empty except for a black cat staring at me with a scary, sharp look. The shops were closed and there was no one about. I started to grow anxious as it got dark. I walked across to a cafe and sat down at a table, putting my bag on the seat beside me. The cafe was empty except for two rough­looking men at a table next to the window. They observed me threateningly and suddenly started to approach me. I really wanted to escape.",
		"When Amy heard her name called, she stood up from her seat and made her way to the stage. Dr. Wilkinson was pinning a gold medal on each of the top five medical graduates. He shook Amy’s hand and congratulated her on her accomplishment. Amy felt overwhelmingly thrilled for being mentioned as one of the top five medical graduates of her school. Amy walked back to her seat satisfied with her academic performance and pleased with her success. She just received a special honor. This special recognition would help her to continue fulfilling her life-long dream of becoming a dedicated doctor.",
		"On the way home, Shirley noticed a truck parked in front of the house across the street. New neighbors! Shirley was dying to know about them. “Do you know anything about the new neighbors?” she asked Pa at dinner. He said, “Yes, and there’s one thing that may be interesting to you.” Shirley had a billion more questions. Pa said joyfully, “They have a girl just your age. Maybe she wants to be your playmate.” Shirley nearly dropped her fork on the floor. How many times had she prayed for a friend? Finally, her prayers were answered! She and the new girl could go to school together, play together, and become best friends.",
		"Finally, it was Shaun’s turn to give a speech. When he opened his mouth, nothing but air escaped his throat. Then he tried to speak again, not knowing what to say. He had prepared to talk about time and he started with the word: ‘Time......’ But nothing followed. Shaun could not find the words. Laughter started to pass through the auditorium from front to back. Even the judges looked disappointed. He didn’t know what to say. He looked into the crowd. The audience at the contest were laughing out loud now, at him, at his inability.",
		"My twelve-­year-­old son and I were returning home after a trip. When we entered the side door leading to the kitchen, I immediately knew that something was wrong. Before I could turn on the light, I realized the house was incredibly cold. On turning on the switch, I found that everything was out of order. The window above the sink was broken, and hundreds of pieces of glass made a mess on my kitchen floor. My legs were trembling so badly that I could hardly stand still. I held my son by the arm and whispered, “Someone broke in and might still be inside.” We ran to a neighbor’s.",
		"When the vote was announced, my brain just would not work out the right percentages to discover whether we had the necessary two­-thirds majority. Then one of the technicians turned to me with a big smile on his face and said, “You’ve got it!” At that moment, the cameras outside took over and out there in the yard there was a scene of joy almost beyond belief. Then the cameras came back to those of us who were in the studio. I managed to overcome my urge to burst into tears, and expressed my joy and delight that after all these years this had happened and my thanks to my daughters and my family who had shared in the struggle so long.",
		"I thought I knew how to drive. But when I drove out of the parking lot, I doubted whether I could make it. There was a dangerous road with its hairpin turns that twisted back and forth down the mountain. At the first curve, my heart started beating fast. My palms were sweating and slippery on the wheel. I crept along with my foot on the brake, but the road doubled back so sharply and dropped so steeply that even with my foot on the brake, the car was going faster than I wanted it to. When I came out of that curve, I was in the outside lane, the one nearest to the side of the cliff. There was no way I could think of to get out of this risky situation.",
		"One day I caught a taxi to work. When I got into the back seat, I saw a brand new cell phone sitting right next to me. I asked the driver, “Where did you drop the last person off?” and showed him the phone. He pointed at a girl walking up the street. We drove up to her and I rolled down the window yelling out to her. She was very thankful and by the look on her face I could tell how grateful she was. Her smile made me smile and feel really good inside. After she got the phone back, I heard someone walking past her say, “Today’s your lucky day!”",
		"One night, I opened the door that led to the second floor, noting that the hallway light was off. I thought nothing of it because I knew there was a light switch next to the stairs that I could turn on. What happened next was something that chilled my blood. When I put my foot down on the first step, I felt a movement under the stairs. My eyes were drawn to the darkness beneath them. Once I realized something strange was happening, my heart started beating fast. Suddenly, I saw a hand reach out from between the steps and grab my ankle. I let out a terrifying scream that could be heard all the way down the block, but nobody answered!",
		"It was my first day of school at St. Roma High School. The uniforms were a lot fancier than in middle school. As a St. Roma student, I had to wear a green sweater with the school label on the shoulder, khaki skirt or khaki pants, a white blouse, and a green St. Roma tie. “There’s my St. Roma student,” said Mom. “You’re ready for your first day?” she asked. “Yes!” I told her. When we got into the car and headed to school, my mind started to imagine how my first day of school would turn out. Maybe I’ll have new friends. Maybe I’ll be the best in the class. I could not wait to start my first day at a new school.",
		"Norm and his friend Jason went on a winter camping trip. In the middle of the night, Norm suddenly woke up sensing something was terribly wrong. To his surprise, the stove was glowing red! Norm shook Jason awake and told him to look at the stove. Jason said he had filled it with every piece of wood he could fit into it. Norm thought the cabin was going to catch fire. He started swearing at Jason. He pulled Jason out of his bed, opened the front door and threw him out into the snow. Norm yelled out in anger, “Don’t come back in until I get this stove cooled off!”",
		"Erda lay on her back in a clearing, watching drops of sunlight slide through the mosaic of leaves above her. She joined them for a little, moving with the gentle breeze, feeling the warm sun feed her. A slight smile was spreading over her face. She slowly turned over and pushed her face into the grass, smelling the green pleasant scent from the fresh wild flowers. Free from her daily burden, she got to her feet and went on. Erda walked between the warm trunks of the trees. She felt all her concerns had gone away.",
		"It was a day I was due to give a presentation at work, not something I’d do often. As I stood up to begin, I froze. A chilly ‘pins­and­needles’ feeling crept over me, starting in my hands. Time seemed to stand still as I struggled to start speaking, and I felt a pressure around my throat, as though my voice was trapped and couldn’t come out. Gazing around at the blur of faces, I realized they were all waiting for me to begin, but by now I knew I couldn’t continue.",
		"Hours later — when my back aches from sitting, my hair is styled and dry, and my almost invisible makeup has been applied — Ash tells me it’s time to change into my dress. We’ve been waiting until the last minute, afraid any refreshments I eat might accidentally fall onto it and stain it. There’s only thirty minutes left until the show starts, and the nerves that have been torturing Ash seem to have escaped her, choosing a new victim in me. My palms are sweating, and I have butterflies in my stomach. Nearly all the models are ready, some of them already dressed in their nineteenth­century costumes. Ash tightens my corset.",
		"I’m not sure which one of us did the talking, but it must have been pretty convincing because Mr. Montague agreed to audition us the very next day. We couldn’t believe it. We were shocked. Rehearsal was over for the day. After we stopped screaming and hugging and dancing around Jean’s basement, I ran all the way home to tell Mom about our “lucky break.” She was delighted, and she insisted on going with us to the audition, as much for support as to make sure everything was going smoothly. I felt like a little kid on Christmas Eve. I didn’t sleep even an hour that night. That was probably why the next day seemed like a dream.",
		"When I looked back, it was almost on me. I forced myself to keep running, my heart beating wildly. But it kept on coming, more determined than ever to catch me. I ran into a small hut near the end of the village, hoping I could find protection there; but the hut was empty and that horrible, nightmarish creature grew closer with every step. When I saw its looming shadow in the doorway, I flattened myself against the far wall. It came toward me, my screams for help growing louder with every step it took. Finally, it was but mere inches from my face. I closed my eyes and prayed for a quick death. It reached slowly with its massive claws toward me and said, “I got you!”",
		"Yesterday I got up early because I wanted to clean my room before school. I began to organize my desk, but then I heard a knocking sound from the front door. It was too early in the morning for someone to be there. I wondered who it could be. Since my parents were still asleep, they didn’t answer the door. So I headed downstairs to investigate. At the door I asked, “Who is it?” The person replied, “It’s me! Open up.” It was a voice I knew very well. “Grandma! I can’t believe you’re here!” I screamed as I flung open the door. It was such an unexpected delight to see her standing there. I welcomed her with plenty of hugs and kisses.",
		"One afternoon, as I wandered around the shops near my hotel, I saw a poor gypsy woman sitting on the sidewalk outside the subway station. She looked tired and lonely, and her eyes were fixed firmly on the ground. A young toddler played at her feet merrily, not knowing her mother’s sadness. Then, a young woman who worked at a nearby tourist shop came out of the shop, holding some food. She went over to the gypsy woman, smiled at the child and handed over the food. While the shop assistant was happily responding to the toddler’s playful touches, I saw a smile flashing across the gypsy woman’s face. It was a heartwarming moment. That day I learned a lesson in human kindness.",
		"Joni went horseback riding with her older sisters. She had a hard time keeping up with them because her pony was half the size of their horses. Her sisters, on their big horses, thought it was exciting to cross the river at the deepest part. They never seemed to notice that Joni’s little pony sank a bit deeper. It had rained earlier that week and the river was brown and swollen. As her pony walked into the middle of the river, Joni turned pale, staring at the swirling waters rushing around the legs of her pony. Her heart started to race and her mouth became dry.",
		"“I can’t believe we made – how much did we make?” cried Megan once they got back to her house. “One hundred and four dollars each. Each!” shouted Jessie. She couldn’t stop hopping from one foot to the other. “I’ve never seen so much money in my life!” Jessie was already running numbers in her head. Subtracting the eighty dollars that she and Megan had spent on lemonade and cups, each girl had made a profit of sixty­-four dollars. If they doubled the number of their franchises from thirteen to twenty­-six, they could each make one hundred and twenty­-eight dollars in one day! Jessie pulled out a piece of paper and scribbled down a graph. The sky was the limit.",
		"She just couldn’t take her eyes off it. Nor, for that matter, could she wait to try it on. Quickly she slipped off her own plain red coat. She was breathing fast now, she couldn’t help it, and her eyes were stretched very wide. But, the feel of that fur! The great black coat seemed to slide onto her almost by itself, like a second skin. It was the strangest feeling! She looked into the mirror. She looked wonderful, beautiful, and rich, all at the same time. And the sense of power that it gave her! In this coat she could walk into any place she wanted and people would come running around her like rabbits. The whole thing was just too wonderful for words!",
		"A shivery feeling shot through Billy. It was a good feeling at first. He tried to locate his father among the sea of heads, but he couldn’t. And then the good feeling turned bad. He had an odd sensation that the world around him was moving in all directions. His mouth was dry. His heart was pounding. He forgot every word of his poem, including the title, but he didn’t have a copy of it to read from. He saw Ms. Silver in the fringes of his vision. She was smiling and nodding, urging him on with her wide eyes. Should he walk over to her to get a copy of his poem? She seemed about a mile away. And he didn’t think he could make his legs move.",
		"Evan’s eyes opened wide and his mouth made the shape of an O, which happened whenever something surprised him. “You don’t mean we’re leaving Sydney?” he asked. His mother had just told him they were leaving Sydney for his father’s work. “But what about school?” said Evan, interrupting her, a thing he knew he was not supposed to do but which he felt he would be forgiven for on this occasion. “And what about Carl and Daniel and Martin? How will they know where I am when we want to do things together?” His mother told him that he would have to say goodbye to his friends for the time being but that she was sure Evan would see them again. “Say goodbye to them? Say goodbye to them?” He kept repeating himself, sounding more and more anxious with every repetition.",
		"The rain was more than a quick spring shower because in the last ten minutes, it had only gotten louder and heavier. The thunder was getting even closer. Sadie and Lauren were out there with no rain gear. No shelter. And standing in the midst of too many tall trees―or lightning rods. Sadie looked up, trying to see if the black cloud was moving. But it was no longer just one cloud. It appeared as though the entire sky had turned dark. Their innocent spring shower had turned into a raging thunderstorm. “Maybe we should go back the direction we came from,” Sadie said, panicked. “Do you know which way we came?” Lauren asked, her eyes darting around. Sadie’s heart fell. Sadie realized with anxiety that she didn’t even know where she’d taken her last ten steps from. Every angle looked exactly the same. Every tree a twin to the one beside it. Every fallen limb mimicking ten others.",
		"The sun caught the ends of the hairs along the bear’s back. Shining black and silky, it stood on its hind legs, half up, and studied Brian, just studied him. Then it lowered itself and moved slowly to the left, eating berries as it rolled along, delicately using its mouth to lift each berry from the stem. In seconds it was gone. Gone, and Brian still had not moved. His tongue was stuck to the top of his mouth, the tip half out, and his eyes were wide. Then Brian made a low sound, “Nnnnnnnggg.” It made no sense. It was just a sound of fear, of his disbelief that something that large could have come so close to him without his knowing. Brian couldn’t stop shivering, thinking that the bear could return and attack him anytime.",
		"There was a flash of movement in the window. Richard slowly began to step backwards. Quickly he opened the closet and went inside closing the door behind him. Heavy footsteps began to advance towards the room. Richard’s throat was dry, and his mind was racing out of control. Staring out into the room, Richard felt his heart pounding harder than it had ever pounded before. There now standing in the room, the same room Richard was in, was a man so hideous; it took his breath away. Suddenly the man began sniffing around the room. Richard knew he was about to be discovered. His heart began to pound faster.",
		"Suddenly, just a few minutes after Timothy dozed off, something woke him up. Something was crawling on his belly as he was lying there with nothing around his upper body. Two scorpions from the rocks above had fallen on his stomach. They were battling with each other. Timothy, not knowing what to do, stayed very still just watching them fight. His heart started pounding heavily; he was too scared to make a move. Sweat poured from his forehead. The two scorpions were violently attacking each other, and it seemed they were fighting to the death. Timothy nervously looked down at the ground. He saw another scorpion, and not far from that one was another one. This time Timothy started to sweat even more heavily.",
		"Tavil feels he understands this buried world and he is ready to leave. But when he turns, the hole he’d climbed through no longer exists. In its place is a smooth wall of white tile, a continuation of the unending pattern throughout the tunnel. The broken scraps of debris that had littered the base of the hole are gone as well. And this is when he feels the horrifying truth of where he is: so deep underground that the climb down made the muscles in his legs and arms tremble. He is trapped. Brutally so. As if in a grave, in a tomb. Frightened, he claws at the tiles. He screams, not caring if someone hears; hoping they do and will cast him out.",
		"One night a buddy and I decided we were going to go find that Big Foot. We were in my old truck and we set off across the fields heading toward the tallest hill. The fields were rough, with only the slightest trail to follow. Along the way there were small trenches dug in the fields. I never figured out why. As we got closer and closer to the top of the hill, I was actually becoming scared, which was kind of rare, because at that age I was pretty fearless. As we got to the top of the hill, there was a loud thump! My truck sunk down like something heavy had just jumped in the bed. We were too terrified to look in the back. I panicked and decided to throw the truck into reverse and back down the hill. As I did so, there was another thump and a loud roar now came out like I’d never, ever heard before.",
		"Hogan had already been walking for hours along the sand track. He had drunk the last remaining drop of water an hour before. His feet came down regularly one in front of the other, sending up little clouds of dust. The dunes stretched as far as the eye could see, motionless, on either side of the track. Nothing was left but the dazzling sand with its millions of tiny broken grains, and dry stones that crumbled away in layers. No trucks passed. No aircraft ever appeared in the immense sky. The nothingness was so great that it could not even be called solitude any longer. It was like floating on the ocean, thousands of miles from land, while tiny waves sweep forward in ripples.",
		"Early one night in 1973 in my old and cheap apartment in Bangor, Maine, I got a phone call from my agent, Bill, who was helping me publish my first novel. “Are you sitting down?” Bill asked. “No,” I said. “Do I need to?” “You might,” he said. “The publication rights for your book were sold for four hundred thousand dollars!” I was completely speechless. That amount of money was beyond my wildest expectations. I was sure I hadn’t heard him right. I couldn’t have. I asked, “Did you say it went for forty thousand dollars?” Bill said it again as clearly as he could, “Four hundred thousand dollars. Congratulations, Steve.” “Are you sure, Bill?” I said in disbelief. He said he was. We talked for another half an hour, but I don’t remember a single word of what we said.",
		"Delia stepped out of the front door of her house, and the day welcomed her with a warm and sunny smile. With each step, she thought, “I can’t wait for today’s class.” Her family had recently moved into the neighborhood, and the new school year had just begun at Elanova High School. Her new school offered ballet lessons, and Delia eagerly signed up. She was one step closer to fulfilling her lifelong dream of becoming a ballerina. Delia sat at the bench waiting for the school bus. As the bus rolled down Madison Avenue, she slipped her hand into her ballet bag to touch her new shoes. She thought about working hard on her leaps and jumps. “I want to soar to the moon,” Delia thought.",
		"One morning, my 5-year-old daughter shook me awake excitedly. “A fairy has left you an amazing present,” she whispered. “Look!” I reached under my pillow and found a one dollar note, torn exactly in half. She said, “The fairy left half a dollar for you, and the other half is under daddy’s pillow.” I was struck speechless at her unexpected gift. Simultaneously, I found myself in a dilemma. Messages about how important it was for my daughter to learn the value of currency came flooding into my mind. Should I use this opportunity to teach her about not wasting money, explaining that a dollar torn in half is worthless? Should I try not to discourage her kind behavior? My thoughts all came in a rush: Which quality should I reinforce? Which behavior should I promote?",
		"Both of us quiet, I put Lucy’s Mickey Mouse pajamas on her. Silent and somewhat still, she stood on the changing table as I held her close to zip her up. I breathed in the clean smell of her hair, feeling blonde curls tickle my chin. Suddenly, Lucy reached her arms around my neck, holding the back of my head tight between her arms. Little hands, little everything, pulled me to her, and she pressed her cheek to mine. It took only a moment to realize what was happening. “She’s hugging me for the very first time.” I wanted to yell for my husband, a neighbor, anyone to come see what my daughter was doing for the first time. We held each other for a few seconds, my daughter standing on the changing table dressed in her fuzzy red sleeper, her arms around my neck, her cheek pressed to my left shoulder. “Oh, Lucy,” I whispered, my words tight with tears. I never wanted to let go.",
		"I opened the letter and started reading. I didn’t even read the whole thing. I read only the beginning―where it said, ‘We are pleased to inform you that you have received a scholarship that covers full tuition’―and I started jumping and running around the house. I couldn’t even believe it. I read the letter four more times. My dream school had offered me a full scholarship. That was more money than I could even imagine. All the stress, studying for exams, and staying up late to study―it was all worth it.",
		"Early in his career as a pilot, Matt Brown was flying a twin-engine plane northeast out of Harlingen, Texas, when he noticed a drop in oil pressure in his right engine. He was alone, flying through the night at eleven thousand feet. He reduced altitude and kept an eye on the oil gauge, hoping to fly as far as a planned fuel stop in Louisiana, where he could service the plane, but the pressure kept falling. Matt has been messing around with piston engines since he was old enough to hold a wrench, and he knew he had a problem. If he let the oil pressure get too low, he risked the engine’s stopping. How much further could he fly before shutting it down? What would happen when he did? He breathed heavily and felt the dreadful cold sweat running down his back.",
		"Stepping off the plane, Kara let the heat sink into her bones. Breathing in the new air, she felt the kind of excitement that only new beginnings could offer. With the phone number of a professional surfer from her flight folded in her pocket, she felt the promise of an exciting new life. She grabbed a cab to her new apartment, one that she’d found online―just close enough to campus that she could walk, but far enough that she didn’t feel she’d be overwhelmed by campus events. She looked happily out the window, welcoming the warm air and hot sun on her face, and at the palm trees and sidewalks full of athletic people running, skateboarding, and casually hanging out with friends. She couldn’t wait to get to the beach to start making friends.",
		"Sipping coffee leisurely at a café, Kate was enjoying the view of the Ponte Vecchio across the Arno. As an architect and professor, she had taught about the historical significance of the bridge to her students for years. A smile crept across her face. It was her first time to actually see it in person. Though not as old as the bridges of Rome, it was absolutely a work of art. If the fleeing Nazis had destroyed it during World War II, she would have never seen it. She was happy that she could view the bridge in the twilight. Free from her daily concerns, her mind began to wander from the unforgettable views of the still Arno to all the unexpected but pleasant encounters with other tourists. The trip was a rare liberating experience. Kate felt that all her concerns had melted away.",
		"The departmental head took Billy to view his own private office. It was a room situated in St. Joseph’s Hall on the edge of the college grounds. “This room was formerly used as a guest room for visitors,” she explained. “I hope you’ll be comfortable here.” Comfortable! That’s putting it mildly, Billy thought. A shiver of delight ran down his spine when he saw his name in capital letters on the door: MR BILLY HOPKINS, SENIOR LECTURER IN EDUCATION. The room was spacious and there was a large window overlooking the college grounds. Billy sat at his desk and looked out at the neat lawns and flower­-filled gardens. Somewhere in the college a choir was singing and his joy was complete.",
		"As I walked to the train station, I felt the warm sun on my back. I caught my train on time. It arrived at my destination ten minutes early, which was perfect, as I was due to present my new idea to the company at 10 a.m. The presentation went better than expected, and my manager seemed particularly pleased. Later that day, my manager called me into her office. She smiled at me and said, “James, you’ve been with us for six years now. How would you feel if I were to offer you the Sales Director position in London?” Sales Director in London! Wow! This was a dream come true for me. I couldn’t believe what I had just heard!",
		"I’m leaving early tomorrow morning, finally! I’ve always wanted to explore the Amazon, the unknown and mysterious world. At this hour, the great Emerald Amazon Explorer should be at the port waiting for me to get on board. Freshwater dolphins will escort me on the playful river, and 500 species of birds, half a dozen species of monkeys, and numerous colorful butterflies will welcome me into their kingdom. I wish I could camp in the wild and enjoy the company of mosquitos, snakes, and spiders. I’d love to make the world’s largest rainforest home. My heart swells as much as my chubby bags; yet, I’d better get some sleep since a long, tough journey is ahead of me.",
		"It is very important to help poor countries, but it’s not simple. We should be giving money or food directly to the poor in emergencies like an earthquake or flood. In less emergent situations, however, providing food can make people dependent. If a developed country gives food to a poor country, its local farmers will find it difficult to produce food to sell. We need to help poor people to earn their own money, or to produce their own food. Just giving them money or food is not a good idea. We have to find a way to help them stand on their own two feet.",
		"Even though people who set high expectations for themselves tend to achieve more in a negotiation than those who set low goals, they are almost always less satisfied with their results. Why? Because when the negotiation is over, they compare their final outcome to their initial expectations and focus on what they didn't get from the deal and feel like they failed. To solve this problem, they need to learn how to change their focus after the negotiation is complete. They must view their results in a more positive manner. With this simple adjustment of focus they will recognize everything they were able to get in the negotiation and feel pleased with their work.",
		"Most people don’t assess their roles frequently enough and so stay in positions for years longer than they should, settling for suboptimal situations. There isn’t a magic number for the amount of time you should stay in one role before evaluating whether it’s right or not. But it makes sense to think about how often you do. Some people readjust their lives daily or weekly, constantly optimizing. Others wait years before noticing that they’ve ended up far from where they had hoped to be. The more frequently you assess your situation, looking for ways to fix problems, the more likely you are to find yourself in a position where things are going well.",
		"As adults, we have a responsibility to teach children to respect and interact with animals in a positive way. Children love animals; they are fascinated by them and can develop very special connections and relationships with them. At the same time, they need to be taught how to interact with animals and, most importantly, when to leave the animals alone. Children must be taught not to chase the family dog or cat, or the wild birds and rabbits at the park. Such lessons help to establish a strong love and respect for all living things―animals can play a huge role in the development of compassion and understanding for our fellow human beings.",
		"Some people need money more than we do. For example, some people have lost their homes due to natural disasters or war, while others don’t have enough food or clothing. So this year, for our birthdays, let’s tell our friends and family to donate money to a charity instead of buying us presents. I know that some kids might not want to give up their birthday presents, and I understand. However, remember that we can live without new toys or games more easily than someone can live without food, clothing, or shelter. So, we should tell our friends and family that, for our birthdays this year, we want to give to others.",
		"The Internet is wonderful in so many different ways. It has transformed the way we live. We can contact people instantly, wherever they are. We can plan things together, without ever needing to meet. We have access to a world of information at the click of a mouse. But on the other hand, the Internet glues us to our computer monitors and isolates us from our fellow human beings. We will now e-mail someone a message, rather than call them up or walk ten yards to the next office to say hello. We need to create a balance between the World Wide Web and the real wide world we live in. Turn your computer off for one day a week, leave your laptop at home, get out into the real world and live your life.",
		"Have you ever heard anyone say, “I had to carry the ball”? The expression “to carry the ball” means to take responsibility for getting something done. We use clichés like this every day in our speech. These expressions are colorful and often appealing in their economy and ability to convey an image or description of an emotion or situation. Someone may be “cold as ice” or “busy as a bee.” A story may be “too funny for words.” These expressions in speech do little harm. In writing, however, clichés suffer the fate of the familiar becoming boring. Your reader has heard and read these expressions so often that they tend to “bounce off” the reader so swiftly that they lose their appeal. Therefore, if you want your writing to be stronger and more effective, try not to use clichés. Clichés in writing ultimately diminish the strength and effectiveness of your message.",
		"The fast pace of today’s lifestyle has us piling one thing on top of another. But you should know that multitasking doesn’t save any time. Very often, multitasking only slows you down, contrary to popular belief. Give your whole focus to what you’re doing at the moment no matter what it is. While doing the laundry, just do the laundry: Listen to the sound of the water as it fills the washing machine and feel the clothes in your hand. It doesn’t take up any more time than it would when done with your phone pressed to your ear. The same applies to your work. Focus on one task at a time, and you’ll accomplish each task better, and probably faster.",
		"Since you can’t use gestures, make faces, or present an object to readers in writing, you must rely on words to do both the telling and the showing. Show more than you tell. Use words to make the reader see. For example, don’t leave the reader guessing about Laura’s beautiful hair. Show how the gentle wind touches the edge of her silky, brown hair. Don’t just say you felt happy. Show yourself leaping down the steps four at a time, coat unzipped, shouting in the wind, “Hurray, I did it!”",
		"Strong negative feelings are part of being human. Problems occur when we try too hard to control or avoid these feelings. A helpful way of coping with strong negative feelings is to take them for what they are―messages from your mind and body intended to keep you safe. For instance, if you are afraid of a work presentation, trying to avoid your anxiety will likely reduce your confidence and increase your fear. Instead, try to accept your anxiety as a signal that you are probably nervous about public speaking―just like most other people. This helps you lower the level of your anxiety and stress, increasing your confidence and making the presentation much easier.",
		"Kids learn mostly by example. They model their own behavior after their parents and their older siblings. If your kids have bad eating habits, ask yourself how that happened in the first place. If you eat a poor diet yourself, neglect your health, or smoke and drink in front of them, you shouldn’t be surprised when your children go down the same road. So be a good role model and set the stage for healthy eating at home and when you eat out as a family. Your actions speak louder than your words. Do not expect your kids to know for themselves what is good for them.",
		"Don’t let distractions interrupt your attentive listening to the speaker. You want to send the message that what the speaker is saying is important to you. That message will ring hollow if you answer your cell phone and put the speaker on hold. If your cell phone rings while you are in a conversation, fight the urge to answer. For reasons unknown, most people feel compelled to answer a ringing phone. The fact that your cell phone is ringing doesn’t mean you have to answer it. Rarely are phone calls urgent. If no message is left, that is clearly the case. And if a message is left, you can listen to it, usually in a matter of minutes, once your conversation has finished. Even in today’s tech-savvy world, answering phone calls during a conversation is disrespectful.",
		"Language play is good for children’s language learning and development, and therefore we should strongly encourage, and even join in their language play. However, the play must be owned by the children. If it becomes another educational tool for adults to use to produce outcomes, it loses its very essence. Children need to be able to delight in creative and immediate language play, to say silly things and make themselves laugh, and to have control over the pace, timing, direction, and flow. When children are allowed to develop their language play, a range of benefits result from it.",
		"It is easy to judge people based on their actions. We are often taught to put more value in actions than words, and for good reason. The actions of others often speak volumes louder than their words. However, when someone exhibits some difficult behavior, you might want to reserve judgement for later. People are not always defined by their behavior. It is common to think, “He is so bossy,” or “She is so mean,” after observing less­than­desirable behavior in someone. But you should never make such assumptions right away. You should give someone a second chance before you label them and shut them out forever. You may find a great co­worker or best friend in someone, so don’t eliminate a person from your life based on a brief observation.",
		"Many people think of what might happen in the future based on past failures and get trapped by them. For example, if you have failed in a certain area before, when faced with the same situation, you anticipate what might happen in the future, and thus fear traps you in yesterday. Do not base your decision on what yesterday was. Your future is not your past and you have a better future. You must decide to forget and let go of your past. Your past experiences are the thief of today’s dreams only when you allow them to control you.",
		"Something comes over most people when they start writing. They write in a language different from the one they would use if they were talking to a friend. If, however, you want people to read and understand what you write, write it in spoken language. Written language is more complex, which makes it more work to read. It’s also more formal and distant, which makes the readers lose attention. You don’t need complex sentences to express ideas. Even when specialists in some complicated field express their ideas, they don’t use sentences any more complex than they do when talking about what to have for lunch. If you simply manage to write in spoken language, you have a good start as a writer.",
		"How do you encourage other people when they are changing their behavior? Suppose you see a friend who is on a diet and has been losing a lot of weight. It’s tempting to tell her that she looks great and she must feel wonderful. It feels good for someone to hear positive comments, and this feedback will often be encouraging. However, if you end the discussion there, then the only feedback your friend is getting is about her progress toward an outcome. Instead, continue the discussion. Ask about what she is doing that has allowed her to be successful. What is she eating? Where is she working out? What are the lifestyle changes she has made? When the conversation focuses on the process of change rather than the outcome, it reinforces the value of creating a sustainable process.",
		"If you were at a social gathering in a large building and you overheard someone say that “the roof is on fire,” what would be your reaction? Until you knew more information, your first inclination might be toward safety and survival. But if you were to find out that this particular person was talking about a song called “The Roof Is on Fire,” your feelings of threat and danger would be diminished. So once the additional facts are understood―that the person was referring to a song and not a real fire―the context is better understood and you are in a better position to judge and react. All too often people react far too quickly and emotionally over information without establishing context. It is so important for us to identify context related to information because if we fail to do so, we may judge and react too quickly.",
		"It can be tough to settle down to study when there are so many distractions. Most young people like to combine a bit of homework with quite a lot of instant messaging, chatting on the phone, updating profiles on social­networking sites, and checking emails. While it may be true that you can multi­task and can focus on all these things at once, try to be honest with yourself. It is most likely that you will be able to work best if you concentrate on your studies but allow yourself regular breaks—every 30 minutes or so—to catch up on those other pastimes.",
		"You can buy conditions for happiness, but you can’t buy happiness. It’s like playing tennis. You can’t buy the joy of playing tennis at a store. You can buy the ball and the racket, but you can’t buy the joy of playing. To experience the joy of tennis, you have to learn, to train yourself to play. It’s the same with writing calligraphy. You can buy the ink, the rice paper, and the brush, but if you don’t cultivate the art of calligraphy, you can’t really do calligraphy. So calligraphy requires practice, and you have to train yourself. You are happy as a calligrapher only when you have the capacity to do calligraphy. Happiness is also like that. You have to cultivate happiness; you cannot buy it at a store.",
		"Twenty­three percent of people admit to having shared a fake news story on a popular social networking site, either accidentally or on purpose, according to a 2016 Pew Research Center survey. It’s tempting for me to attribute it to people being willfully ignorant. Yet the news ecosystem has become so overcrowded and complicated that I can understand why navigating it is challenging. When in doubt, we need to cross­check story lines ourselves. The simple act of fact­checking prevents misinformation from shaping our thoughts. We can consult websites such as FactCheck.org to gain a better understanding of what’s true or false, fact or opinion.",
		"We tend to go long periods of time without reaching out to the people we know. Then, we suddenly take notice of the distance that has formed and we scramble to make repairs. We call people we haven’t spoken to in ages, hoping that one small effort will erase the months and years of distance we’ve created. However, this rarely works: relationships aren’t kept up with big one-time fixes. They’re kept up with regular maintenance, like a car. In our relationships, we have to make sure that not too much time goes by between oil changes, so to speak. This isn’t to say that you shouldn’t bother calling someone just because it’s been a while since you’ve spoken; just that it’s more ideal not to let yourself fall out of touch in the first place. Consistency always brings better results.",
		"Keeping good ideas floating around in your head is a great way to ensure that they won’t happen. Take a tip from writers, who know that the only good ideas that come to life are the ones that get written down. Take out a piece of paper and record everything you’d love to do someday—aim to hit one hundred dreams. You’ll have a reminder and motivator to get going on those things that are calling you, and you also won’t have the burden of remembering all of them. When you put your dreams into words you begin putting them into action.",
		"The dish you start with serves as an anchor food for your entire meal. Experiments show that people eat nearly 50 percent greater quantity of the food they eat first. If you start with a dinner roll, you will eat more starches, less protein, and fewer vegetables. Eat the healthiest food on your plate first. As age‒old wisdom suggests, this usually means starting with your vegetables or salad. If you are going to eat something unhealthy, at least save it for last. This will give your body the opportunity to fill up on better options before you move on to starches or sugary desserts.",
		"Any goal you set is going to be difficult to achieve, and you will certainly be disappointed at some points along the way. So why not set your goals much higher than you consider worthy from the beginning? If they are going to require work, effort, and energy, then why not exert 10 times as much of each? What if you are underestimating your capabilities? You might be protesting, saying, “What of the disappointment that comes from setting unrealistic goals?” However, take just a few moments to look back over your life. Chances are that you have more often been disappointed by setting targets that are too low and achieving them―only to be shocked that you still didn’t get what you wanted.",
		"When I was in high school, we had students who could study in the coffee shop and not get distracted by the noise or everything happening around them. We also had students who could not study if the library was not super quiet. The latter students suffered because even in the library, it was impossible to get the type of complete silence they sought. These students were victims of distractions who found it very difficult to study anywhere except in their private bedrooms. In today’s world, it is impossible to run away from distractions. Distractions are everywhere, but if you want to achieve your goals, you must learn how to tackle distractions. You cannot eliminate distractions, but you can learn to live with them in a way that ensures they do not limit you.",
		"At a publishing house and at a newspaper you learn the following: It’s not a mistake if it doesn’t end up in print. It’s the same for email. Nothing bad can happen if you haven’t hit the Send key. What you’ve written can have misspellings, errors of fact, rude comments, obvious lies, but it doesn’t matter. If you haven’t sent it, you still have time to fix it. You can correct any mistake and nobody will ever know the difference. This is easier said than done, of course. Send is your computer’s most attractive command. But before you hit the Send key, make sure that you read your document carefully one last time.",
		"Sometimes, you feel the need to avoid something that will lead to success out of discomfort. Maybe you are avoiding extra work because you are tired. You are actively shutting out success because you want to avoid being uncomfortable. Therefore, overcoming your instinct to avoid uncomfortable things at first is essential. Try doing new things outside of your comfort zone. Change is always uncomfortable, but it is key to doing things differently in order to find that magical formula for success.",
		"Some experts estimate that as much as half of what we communicate is done through the way we move our bodies. Paying attention to the nonverbal messages you send can make a significant difference in your relationship with students. In general, most students are often closely tuned in to their teacher’s body language. For example, when your students first enter the classroom, their initial action is to look for their teacher. Think about how encouraging and empowering it is for a student when that teacher has a friendly greeting and a welcoming smile. Smiling at students―to let them know that you are glad to see them―does not require a great deal of time or effort, but it can make a significant difference in the classroom climate right from the start of class.",
		"When I was in the army, my instructors would show up in my barracks room, and the first thing they would inspect was our bed. It was a simple task, but every morning we were required to make our bed to perfection. It seemed a little ridiculous at the time, but the wisdom of this simple act has been proven to me many times over. If you make your bed every morning, you will have accomplished the first task of the day. It will give you a small sense of pride and it will encourage you to do another task and another. By the end of the day, that one task completed will have turned into many tasks completed. If you can’t do little things right, you will never do the big things right.",
		"Meetings encourage creative thinking and can give you ideas that you may never have thought of on your own. However, on average, meeting participants consider about one third of meeting time to be unproductive. But you can make your meetings more productive and more useful by preparing well in advance. You should create a list of items to be discussed and share your list with other participants before a meeting. It allows them to know what to expect in your meeting and prepare to participate.",
		"Experts on writing say, “Get rid of as many words as possible.” Each word must do something important. If it doesn’t, get rid of it. Well, this doesn’t work for speaking. It takes more words to introduce, express, and adequately elaborate an idea in speech than it takes in writing. Why is this so? While the reader can reread, the listener cannot rehear. Speakers do not come equipped with a replay button. Because listeners are easily distracted, they will miss many pieces of what a speaker says. If they miss the crucial sentence, they may never catch up. This makes it necessary for speakers to talk longer about their points, using more words on them than would be used to express the same idea in writing.",
		"You already have a business and you’re about to launch your blog so that you can sell your product. Unfortunately, here is where a ‘business mind’ can be a bad thing. Most people believe that to have a successful business blog promoting a product, they have to stay strictly ‘on the topic.’ If all you’re doing is shamelessly promoting your product, then who is going to want to read the latest thing you’re writing about? Instead, you need to give some useful or entertaining information away for free so that people have a reason to keep coming back. Only by doing this can you create an interested audience that you will then be able to sell to. So, the best way to be successful with a business blog is to write about things that your audience will be interested in.",
		"It is difficult for any of us to maintain a constant level of attention throughout our working day. We all have body rhythms characterised by peaks and valleys of energy and alertness. You will achieve more, and feel confident as a benefit, if you schedule your most demanding tasks at times when you are best able to cope with them. If you haven’t thought about energy peaks before, take a few days to observe yourself. Try to note the times when you are at your best. We are all different. For some, the peak will come first thing in the morning, but for others it may take a",
		"Research shows that people who work have two calendars: one for work and one for their personal lives. Although it may seem sensible, having two separate calendars for work and personal life can lead to distractions. To check if something is missing, you will find yourself checking your to­do lists multiple times. Instead, organize all of your tasks in one place. It doesn’t matter if you use digital or paper media. It’s okay to keep your professional and personal tasks in one place. This will give you a good idea of how time is divided between work and home. This will allow you to make informed decisions about which tasks are most important.",
		"We are always teaching our children something by our words and our actions. They learn from seeing. They learn from hearing and from overhearing. Children share the values of their parents about the most important things in life. Our priorities and principles and our examples of good behavior can teach our children to take the high road when other roads look tempting. Remember that children do not learn the values that make up strong character simply by being told about them. They learn by seeing the people around them act on and uphold those values in their daily lives. Therefore show your child good examples of life by your action. In our daily lives, we can show our children that we respect others. We can show them our compassion and concern when others are suffering, and our own self­discipline, courage and honesty as we make difficult decisions.",
		"Unfortunately, many people don’t take personal responsibility for their own growth. Instead, they simply run the race laid out for them. They do well enough in school to keep advancing. Maybe they manage to get a good job at a well-run company. But so many think and act as if their learning journey ends with college. They have checked all the boxes in the life that was laid out for them and now lack a road map describing the right ways to move forward and continue to grow. In truth, that’s when the journey really begins. When school is finished, your growth becomes voluntary. Like healthy eating habits or a regular exercise program, you need to commit to it and devote thought, time, and energy to it. Otherwise, it simply won’t happen―and your life and career are likely to stop progressing as a result.",
		"Magic is what we all wish for to happen in our life. Do you love the movie Cinderella like me? Well, in real life, you can also create magic. Here’s the trick. Write down all the real­time challenges that you face and deal with. Just change the challenge statement into positive statements. Let me give you an example here. If you struggle with getting up early in the morning, then write a positive statement such as “I get up early in the morning at 5:00 am every day.” Once you write these statements, get ready to witness magic and confidence. You will be surprised that just by writing these statements, there is a shift in the way you think and act. Suddenly you feel more powerful and positive.",
		"Many people choose to adopt a new pet when their old pet passes away. This is their way of replacing a loss with a gain. We are faced with two choices whenever trouble surfaces: we can dwell on the moment and maintain the pain it causes or we can choose to act against it. Acting against adversity means cultivating positivity in whatever way you can. If you’ve lost your job, seek not one but two. If you’ve recently separated from your significant other, take time to rediscover your personal needs and improve your natural abilities. Most important is not allowing yourself to fall victim to your circumstances; you have the ability to counteract negativity with positivity. Choose, instead, to outsmart your challenges by productively working against them. That we hold the power to influence our circumstances is a very reassuring thought.",
		"When you are in the supermarket, do you buy something from each and every aisle? Of course not. You go to aisles that have something you want and skip the aisles that don’t have anything you need. But when it comes to watching television, many of us seem to follow the buy-something-from-every-aisle plan. Too often we watch TV because that’s what we usually do rather than because there is something we actually want to see. Ask yourself when you are watching TV, “Is this something I want to see?” Don’t turn on the TV just because it’s there and that’s what you usually do.",
		"Whenever you find yourself reacting differently than you would if you had unlimited time, you’re acting out of neediness and won’t be reading people clearly. Stop and consider alternative courses of action before you go forward. It’s often best to find a temporary solution to begin with, and decide on a permanent one later. The parents urgently seeking child care could put their immediate efforts into convincing a friend or family member to help out for a week or two, buying them time to look for permanent help. If they can afford it, they can hire a professional nanny for a while. Temporary solutions may be more expensive or inconvenient in the short run, but they’ll give you the time you need to make a wise choice about your long­term selection.",
		"In business school they teach an approach to management decisions that is designed to overcome our natural tendency to cling to the familiar, whether or not it works. If an executive wants to examine a company policy, he or she first puts aside whatever has been done historically, and focuses instead on what the policy should be. Follow the same approach as you examine how you should look, speak and act to best achieve your objectives. Don’t assume that there is some inherent value to the way you have always done things. Keep focused on becoming the best you can be, not how you have always been.",
		"Think back to when you were a kid. How did you play? How did using your imagination make you feel? Being imaginative gives us feelings of happiness and adds excitement to our lives. It’s time to get back to those emotions. If you can return to the joyful feelings that you had through play, you’ll find that you feel happier about yourself. You can use your imagination to write books or invent something. There is no end to how creative you can be when you move into your imagination. It will also keep you focused on completing the tasks at hand because imagination makes everyday tasks more interesting.",
		"Engaged in procrastination, how do you move from being stuck to doing the day’s most difficult tasks? I say, “Eat the frogs!” The idea comes from a Mark Twain quote: “Eat a live frog first thing in the morning, and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.” Every morning, commit to dealing with the item on your to­do list that you’re dreading the most, and do it before anything else. Mornings are especially ideal for when you need to be productive on creative tasks, such as writing, because you have fewer distractions and your mind is free of the stresses that accumulate over the course of a workday. While diving into undesirable tasks first thing, imagine how good it will feel to have gotten over that hurdle and still have a whole day ahead of you.",
		"Too many people suffer from destination disease. They reach a certain level, earn their degrees, buy their dream homes, and then just coast. Studies show 50 percent of high school graduates never read another entire book. One reason may be that they see learning as something you do in school, just something you do for a period of life instead of as a way of life. We all learned when we were in school. Our teachers, coaches, and parents taught us. We were expected to learn when we were school age. But some tend to think that once they finish a certain level of education: “I’m done with school. I’ve got a good job.” Winners never stop learning. Whether you’re nine or ninety years old, you should constantly be learning, improving your skills, and getting better at what you do.",
		"Imagine for a moment that today was your last day on Earth. Now, make a list for yourself of all the things that you feel you have accomplished, all the things you are proud of, and all the things that make you happy. Is your car on the list? Your television? Is your salary on the list? No. What’s on the list are the fundamental elements of a satisfied life―your relationship with friends and family, the contribution you have made to others’ lives, the celebrated events of your life. Those are the building blocks of your list. Many of us live day to day as if the opposite were true. Instead of appreciating what is truly important and making that our priority, we collect things and indicators of success without questioning just what success really means. Remember what really matters in your life.",
		"Children sometimes see and say things to please adults; teachers must realize this and the power it implies. Teachers who prefer that children see beauty as they themselves do are not encouraging a sense of aesthetics in children. They are fostering uniformity and obedience. Only children who choose and evaluate for themselves can truly develop their own aesthetic taste. Just as becoming literate is a basic goal of education, one of the key goals of all creative early childhood programs is to help young children develop the ability to speak freely about their own attitudes, feelings, and ideas about art. Each child has a right to a personal choice of beauty, joy, and wonder. Aesthetic development takes place in secure settings free of competition and adult judgment.",
		"As with memorizing anything, the simple method of repetition will be of help when remembering names. A powerful application of this principle is to repeat it in conversation. In this case you could simply say, “Tom. It’s nice to meet you, Tom.” Saying this short phrase repeats the word twice aloud. Saying something aloud creates a more powerful memory than only thinking it. The choice to say the word, mouthing it and hearing yourself say it, makes up a series of small events that increase memorization more than if you simply repeat the word in your mind. Continuing to repeat the name throughout conversation will further cement it in your memory. Say it whenever you have the opportunity to do so naturally.",
		"You are far more likely to eat what you can see in plain view. Organize the foods in your kitchen so the best choices are most visible and easily accessible. It also helps to hide poor choices in inconvenient places. An even better idea is to simply get rid of anything with low nutritional value that you may be tempted to eat. Put fruits, vegetables, and other healthy options at eye level in your refrigerator, or leave them out on the table. Even when you aren’t hungry, simply seeing these items will plant a seed in your mind for your next snack. Also consider taking small bags of nuts, fruits, or vegetables with you when you are away from home. That way, you can satisfy a mid­afternoon craving even if no good options are available.",
		"Patricia is eager to be the best mom she can be, but she finds parenting a hard task. Here’s how she put it: “Just when I think I have it down, then something changes, and I have to make major adjustments. Parenting well feels like a moving target.” Patricia is correct. In fact, much research has been done on the developmental stages of childhood. Babies learn to sit up, then crawl, and finally walk. Kids have a greater ability to reason as they get older, and logic makes sense as they move further into preadolescence. A logical implication of these developmental changes is that parents will need to make parenting shifts along the way. In other words, the one strategy to keep in mind as your children grow and change is that you must also change to meet their new developmental needs and abilities.",
		"What we need in education is not measurement, accountability, or standards. While these can be useful tools for improvement, they should hardly occupy center stage. Our focus should instead be on making sure we are giving our youth an education that is going to arm them to save humanity. We are faced with unprecedented perils, and these perils are multiplying and pushing at our collective gates. We should be bolstering curriculum that helps young people mature into ethical adults who feel a responsibility to the global community. Without this sense of responsibility we have seen that many talented individuals give in to their greed and pride, and this destroys economies, ecosystems, and entire species. While we certainly should not abandon efforts to develop standards in different content areas, and also strengthen the STEM subjects, we need to take seriously our need for an education centered on global responsibility. If we don’t, we risk extinction.",
		"Breaks are necessary to revive your energy levels and recharge your mental stamina, but they shouldn’t be taken carelessly. If you’ve planned your schedule effectively, you should already have scheduled breaks at appropriate times throughout the day, so any other breaks in the midst of ongoing work hours are unwarranted. While scheduled breaks keep you on track by being strategic, re-energizing methods of self-reinforcement, unscheduled breaks derail you from your goal, as they offer you opportunities to procrastinate by making you feel as if you’ve got “free time.” Taking unscheduled breaks is a sure-fire way to fall into the procrastination trap. You may rationalize that you’re only getting a cup of coffee to keep yourself alert, but in reality, you’re just trying to avoid having to work on a task at your desk. So to prevent procrastination, commit to having no random breaks instead.",
		"I am sure you have heard something like, “You can do anything you want, if you just persist long and hard enough.” Perhaps you have even made a similar assertion to motivate someone to try harder. Of course, words like these sound good, but surely they cannot be true. Few of us can become the professional athlete, entertainer, or movie star we would like to be. Environmental, physical, and psychological factors limit our potential and narrow the range of things we can do with our lives. “Trying harder” cannot substitute for talent, equipment, and method, but this should not lead to despair. Rather, we should attempt to become the best we can be within our limitations. We try to find our niche. By the time we reach employment age, there is a finite range of jobs we can perform effectively.",
		"If you are feeling overwhelmed by the amount of responsibility that you have to deal with in your own life or your own home, you are going to have to figure out a way that you can balance out these responsibilities. For example, is there somebody that you can turn to to tell them that you have too much on your plate and you are feeling too overwhelmed by these responsibilities? If you can find somebody and divide up the labor so that you don’t feel so overwhelmed by everything that you are doing, all you have to do sometimes is to ask for help and your life will feel that much better. Many times people will surprise you with their willingness to help you out, so never assume that other people don’t care about your stress. Let them know honestly how you are feeling and allow yourself some opportunities to avoid responsibility and give yourself a chance to relax.",
		"These days, electric scooters have quickly become a campus staple. Their rapid rise to popularity is thanks to the convenience they bring, but it isn’t without problems. Scooter companies provide safety regulations, but the regulations aren’t always followed by the riders. Students can be reckless while they ride, some even having two people on one scooter at a time. Universities already have certain regulations, such as walk­only zones, to restrict motorized modes of transportation. However, they need to do more to target motorized scooters specifically. To ensure the safety of students who use electric scooters, as well as those around them, officials should look into reinforcing stricter regulations, such as having traffic guards flagging down students and giving them warning when they violate the regulations.",
		"Over the years, memory has been given a bad name. It has been associated with rote learning and cramming information into your brain. Educators have said that understanding is the key to learning, but how can you understand something if you can’t remember it? We have all had this experience: we recognize and understand information but can’t recall it when we need it. For example, how many jokes do you know? You’ve probably heard thousands, but you can only recall about four or five right now. There is a big difference between remembering your four jokes and recognizing or understanding thousands. Understanding doesn’t create use: only when you can instantly recall what you understand, and practice using your remembered understanding, do you achieve mastery. Memory means storing what you have learned; otherwise, why would we bother learning in the first place?",
		"When I started my career, I looked forward to the annual report from the organization showing statistics for each of its leaders. As soon as I received them in the mail, I’d look for my standing and compare my progress with the progress of all the other leaders. After about five years of doing that, I realized how harmful it was. Comparing yourself to others is really just a needless distraction. The only one you should compare yourself to is you. Your mission is to become better today than you were yesterday. You do that by focusing on what you can do today to improve and grow. Do that enough, and if you look back and compare the you of weeks, months, or years ago to the you of today, you should be greatly encouraged by your progress.",
		"We all have set patterns in life. We like to label ourselves as this or that and are quite proud of our opinions and beliefs. We all like to read a particular newspaper, watch the same sorts of TV programs or movies, go to the same sort of shops every time, eat the sort of food that suits us, and wear the same type of clothes. And all this is fine. But if we cut ourselves off from all other possibilities, we become boring, rigid, hardened― and thus likely to get knocked about a bit. You have to see life as a series of adventures. Each adventure is a chance to have fun, learn something, explore the world, expand your circle of friends and experience, and broaden your horizons. Shutting down to adventure means exactly that―you are shut down.",
		"Children may develop imaginary friends around three or four years of age. Imaginary friends are only a concern if children replace all social interactions with pretend friends. As long as children are developing socially with other children, then imaginary friends are beneficial. Parents often will need reassurance about imaginary friends; they should be respectful of the pretend friends, as well as of their child. Children who create imaginary friends should never be teased, humiliated, or ridiculed in any way. Parents may tire of including the friends in daily activities, such as setting an extra plate at dinner, but they should be reassured that the imaginary friends stage will pass. Until then, imaginary friends should be respected and welcomed by parents because they signify a child’s developing imagination.",
		"When trying to convince someone to change their mind, most people try to lay out a logical argument, or make a passionate plea as to why their view is right and the other person’s opinion is wrong. But when you think about it, you’ll realize that this doesn’t often work. As soon as someone figures out that you are on a mission to change their mind, the metaphorical shutters go down. You’ll have better luck if you ask well-chosen, open-ended questions that let someone challenge their own assumptions. We tend to approve of an idea if we thought of it first—or at least, if we think we thought of it first. Therefore, encouraging someone to question their own worldview will often yield better results than trying to force them into accepting your opinion as fact. Ask someone well-chosen questions to look at their own views from another angle, and this might trigger fresh insights.",
		"No matter what your situation, whether you are an insider or an outsider, you need to become the voice that challenges yesterday’s answers. Think about the characteristics that make outsiders valuable to an organization. They are the people who have the perspective to see problems that the insiders are too close to really notice. They are the ones who have the freedom to point out these problems and criticize them without risking their job or their career. Part of adopting an outsider mentality is forcing yourself to look around your organization with this disassociated, less emotional perspective. If you didn’t know your coworkers and feel bonded to them by your shared experiences, what would you think of them? You may not have the job security or confidence to speak your mind to management, but you can make these “outsider” assessments of your organization on your own and use what you determine to advance your career.",
		"Sibling rivalry is natural, especially between strong‑willed kids. As parents, one of the dangers is comparing children unfavorably with each other, since they are always looking for a competitive advantage. The issue is not how fast a child can run, but who crosses the finish line first. A boy does not care how tall he is; he is vitally interested in who is tallest. Children systematically measure themselves against their peers on everything from skateboarding ability to who has the most friends. They are especially sensitive to any failure that is talked about openly within their own family. Accordingly, parents who want a little peace at home should guard against comparative comments that routinely favor one child over another. To violate this principle is to set up even greater rivalry between them.",
		"Without guidance from their teacher, students will not embark on a journey of personal development that recognizes the value of cooperation. Left to their own devices, they will instinctively become increasingly competitive with each other. They will compare scores, reports, and feedback within the classroom environment―just as they do in the sporting arena. We don’t need to teach our students about winners and losers. The playground and the media do that for them. However, we do need to teach them that there is more to life than winning and about the skills they need for successful cooperation. A group working together successfully requires individuals with a multitude of social skills, as well as a high level of interpersonal awareness. While some students inherently bring a natural understanding of these skills with them, they are always in the minority. To bring cooperation between peers into your classroom, you need to teach these skills consciously and carefully, and nurture them continuously throughout the school years.",
		"In 2003, British Airways made an announcement that they would no longer be able to operate the London to New York Concorde flight twice a day because it was starting to prove uneconomical. Well, the sales for the flight on this route increased the very next day. There was nothing that changed about the route or the service offered by the airlines. Merely because it became a scarce resource, the demand for it increased. If you are interested in persuading people, then the principle of scarcity can be effectively used. If you are a salesperson trying to increase the sales of a certain product, then you must not merely point out the benefits the customer can derive from the said product, but also point out its uniqueness and what they will miss out on if they don’t purchase the product soon. In selling, you should keep in mind that the more limited something is, the more desirable it becomes.",
		"Though we are marching toward a more global society, various ethnic groups traditionally do things quite differently, and a fresh perspective is valuable in creating an open­minded child. Extensive multicultural experience makes kids more creative (measured by how many ideas they can come up with and by association skills) and allows them to capture unconventional ideas from other cultures to expand on their own ideas. As a parent, you should expose your children to other cultures as often as possible. If you can, travel with your child to other countries; live there if possible. If neither is possible, there are lots of things you can do at home, such as exploring local festivals, borrowing library books about other cultures, and cooking foods from different cultures at your house.",
		"In the rush towards individual achievement and recognition, the majority of those who make it forget their humble beginnings. They often forget those who helped them on their way up. If you forget where you came from, if you neglect those who were there for you when things were tough and slow, then your success is valueless. No one can make it up there without the help of others. There are parents, friends, advisers, and coaches that help. You need to be grateful to all of those who helped you. Gratitude is the glue that keeps you connected to others. It is the bridge that keeps you connected with those who were there for you in the past and who are likely to be there in the end. Relationships and the way you treat others determine your real success.",
		"We usually take time out only when we really need to switch off, and when this happens we are often overtired, sick, and in need of recuperation. Me time is complicated by negative associations with escapism, guilt, and regret as well as overwhelm, stress, and fatigue. All these negative connotations mean we tend to steer clear of it. Well, I am about to change your perception of the importance of me time, to persuade you that you should view it as vital for your health and wellbeing. Take this as permission to set aside some time for yourself! Our need for time in which to do what we choose is increasingly urgent in an overconnected, overwhelmed, and overstimulated world.",
		"Clarity in an organization keeps everyone working in one accord and energizes key leadership components like trust and transparency. No matter who or what is being assessed in your organization, what they are being assessed on must be clear and the people must be aware of it. If individuals in your organization are assessed without knowing what they are being assessed on, it can cause mistrust and move your organization away from clarity. For your organization to be productive, cohesive, and successful, trust is essential. Failure to have trust in your organization will have a negative effect on the results of any assessment. It will also significantly hinder the growth of your organization. To conduct accurate assessments, trust is a must—which comes through clarity. In turn, assessments help you see clearer, which then empowers your organization to reach optimal success.",
		"The more people have to do unwanted things the more chances are that they create unpleasant environment for themselves and others. If you hate the thing you do but have to do it nonetheless, you have choice between hating the thing and accepting that it needs to be done. Either way you will do it. Doing it from place of hatred will develop hatred towards the self and others around you; doing it from the place of acceptance will create compassion towards the self and allow for opportunities to find a more suitable way of accomplishing the task. If you decide to accept the fact that your task has to be done, start from recognising that your situation is a gift from life; this will help you to see it as a lesson in acceptance.",
		"The introduction of new technologies clearly has both positive and negative impacts for sustainable development. Good management of technological resources needs to take them fully into account. Technological developments in sectors such as nuclear energy and agriculture provide examples of how not only environmental benefits but also risks to the environment or human health can accompany technological advances. New technologies have profound social impacts as well. Since the industrial revolution, technological advances have changed the nature of skills needed in workplaces, creating certain types of jobs and destroying others, with impacts on employment patterns. New technologies need to be assessed for their full potential impacts, both positive and negative.",
		"Managers frequently try to play psychologist, to “figure out” why an employee has acted in a certain way. Empathizing with employees in order to understand their point of view can be very helpful. However, when dealing with a problem area, in particular, remember that it is not the person who is bad, but the actions exhibited on the job. Avoid making suggestions to employees about personal traits they should change; instead suggest more acceptable ways of performing. For example, instead of focusing on a person’s “unreliability,” a manager might focus on the fact that the employee “has been late to work seven times this month.” It is difficult for employees to change who they are; it is usually much easier for them to change how they act.",
		"Agriculture includes a range of activities such as planting, harvesting, fertilizing, pest management, raising animals, and distributing food and agricultural products. It is one of the oldest and most essential human activities, dating back thousands of years, and has played a critical role in the development of human civilizations, allowing people to create stable food supplies and settle in one place. Today, agriculture remains a vital industry that feeds the world’s population, supports rural communities, and provides raw materials for other industries. However, agriculture faces numerous challenges such as climate change, water scarcity, soil degradation, and biodiversity loss. As the world’s population continues to grow, it is essential to find sustainable solutions to address the challenges facing agriculture and ensure the continued production of food and other agricultural products.",
		"Too many times people, especially in today’s generation, expect things to just happen overnight. When we have these false expectations, it tends to discourage us from continuing to move forward. Because this is a high tech society, everything we want has to be within the parameters of our comfort and convenience. If it doesn’t happen fast enough, we’re tempted to lose interest. So many people don’t want to take the time it requires to be successful. Success is not a matter of mere desire; you should develop patience in order to achieve it. Have you fallen prey to impatience? Great things take time to build.",
		"Assertiveness may seem to some people to be uncharacteristic of counselors. If your picture of a counselor is someone who never disagrees, always “goes along,” wants everything to be nice all the time, and only does what other people want him or her to do, this is not a picture of an assertive counselor. Being assertive does not have to mean being disagreeable. Being a counselor does not mean that you should simply be silent when someone tells a racist joke. An assertive counselor would find a way to call that person’s attention to the fact that the joke is racist, explaining how it offended the hearer, and suggesting ways similar jokes could be avoided. Being assertive is a highly developed skill ― it should fit nicely in the counselor’s repertoire of techniques.",
		"At the 2015 Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit, Ginni Rometty offered this advice: “When did you ever learn the most in your life? What experience? I guarantee you’ll tell me it was a time you felt at risk.” To become a better leader, you have to step out of your comfort zone. You have to challenge the conventional ways of doing things and search for opportunities to innovate. Exercising leadership not only requires you to challenge the organizational status quo but also requires you to challenge your internal status quo. You have to challenge yourself. You have to venture beyond the boundaries of your current experience and explore new territory. Those are the places where there are opportunities to improve, innovate, experiment, and grow. Growth is always at the edges, just outside the boundaries of where you are right now.",
		"War is inconceivable without some image, or concept, of the enemy. It is the presence of the enemy that gives meaning and justification to war. ‘War follows from feelings of hatred’, wrote Carl Schmitt. ‘War has its own strategic, tactical, and other rules and points of view, but they all presuppose that the political decision has already been made as to who the enemy is’. The concept of the enemy is fundamental to the moral assessment of war: ‘The basic aim of a nation at war in establishing an image of the enemy is to distinguish as sharply as possible the act of killing from the act of murder’. However, we need to be cautious about thinking of war and the image of the enemy that informs it in an abstract and uniform way. Rather, both must be seen for the cultural and contingent phenomena that they are.",
		"Probably the biggest roadblock to play for adults is the worry that they will look silly, improper, or dumb if they allow themselves to truly play. Or they think that it is irresponsible, immature, and childish to give themselves regularly over to play. Nonsense and silliness come naturally to kids, but they get pounded out by norms that look down on “frivolity.” This is particularly true for people who have been valued for performance standards set by parents or the educational system, or measured by other cultural norms that are internalized and no longer questioned. If someone has spent his adult life worried about always appearing respectable, competent, and knowledgeable, it can be hard to let go sometimes and become physically and emotionally free. The thing is this: You have to give yourself permission to improvise, to mimic, to take on a long-hidden identity.",
		"Developing expertise carries costs of its own. We can become experts in some areas, like speaking a language or knowing our favorite foods, simply by living our lives, but in many other domains expertise requires considerable training and effort. What’s more, expertise is domain specific. The expertise that we work hard to acquire in one domain will carry over only imperfectly to related ones, and not at all to unrelated ones. In the end, as much as we may want to become experts on everything in our lives, there simply isn’t enough time to do so. Even in areas where we could, it won’t necessarily be worth the effort. It’s clear that we should concentrate our own expertise on those domains of choice that are most common and/or important to our lives, and those we actively enjoy learning about and choosing from.",
		"One of the most common mistakes made by organizations when they first consider experimenting with social media is that they focus too much on social media tools and platforms and not enough on their business objectives. The reality of success in the social web for businesses is that creating a social media program begins not with insight into the latest social media tools and channels but with a thorough understanding of the organization’s own goals and objectives. A social media program is not merely the fulfillment of a vague need to manage a “presence” on popular social networks because “everyone else is doing it.” “Being in social media” serves no purpose in and of itself. In order to serve any purpose at all, a social media presence must either solve a problem for the organization and its customers or result in an improvement of some sort (preferably a measurable one). In all things, purpose drives success. The world of social media is no different.",
		"At every step in our journey through life we encounter junctions with many different pathways leading into the distance. Each choice involves uncertainty about which path will get you to your destination. Trusting our intuition to make the choice often ends up with us making a suboptimal choice. Turning the uncertainty into numbers has proved a potent way of analyzing the paths and finding the shortcut to your destination. The mathematical theory of probability hasn’t eliminated risk, but it allows us to manage that risk more effectively. The strategy is to analyze all the possible scenarios that the future holds and then to see what proportion of them lead to success or failure. This gives you a much better map of the future on which to base your decisions about which path to choose.",
		"Values alone do not create and build culture. Living your values only some of the time does not contribute to the creation and maintenance of culture. Changing values into behaviors is only half the battle. Certainly, this is a step in the right direction, but those behaviors must then be shared and distributed widely throughout the organization, along with a clear and concise description of what is expected. It is not enough to simply talk about it. It is critical to have a visual representation of the specific behaviors that leaders and all people managers can use to coach their people. Just like a sports team has a playbook with specific plays designed to help them perform well and win, your company should have a playbook with the key shifts needed to transform your culture into action and turn your values into winning behaviors.",
		"Do you know what fear and doubt fear? Community. One of fear and doubt’s chief aims is to make you feel alone, like you’re the only one who feels a certain way. Fear wants to isolate you and put you on an island. As long as you keep your fear to yourself, no one can tell you the truth about it. No one can help you see what is really going on. No one can encourage you. So if you’re going to tell your voices, “Go away,” you’ve got to share them with other people. You’ve got to tell your close friends or family or a counselor about your voices. The exact person will be different for everyone, but never waste time trying to battle a voice alone. In some cases that voice of fear and doubt will have had a ten-year head start on you. Don’t go it alone.",
		"Obviously, one of the judgments the public has of us is whether or not our telephone service is good. Technically, if they get their calls through, efficiently and promptly, they get what they want. That, however, is not all they want. They want to have the service rendered to them in a manner that pleases them; they want not only efficiency but courtesy and consideration; and they are in a position to get what they want. They are in the driver’s seat; they are paying the bills; and an understanding of that fact is a real and fundamental basis of public relations. In order, therefore, for a great company to satisfactorily serve the public, it must have a philosophy and a method of doing business which will allow and insure that its people serve the public efficiently and in a pleasing manner.",
		"Everybody has moments of doubt about something or other from time to time; it is a natural process. The challenge is not to let those moments accumulate and affect your self-belief. You will always face the challenge of other people’s comments and opinion. There are people that you feel good being around and others you don’t. Some people give you positive energy because they believe in you. You feel it and you rise to the occasion. Others may always have a negative comment to make about what you are doing or talking about. Don’t let these comments rock your self-belief. Always question the person’s reason for the comment. If it is based on fact, you should listen; if not, then it is only their opinion. You will need to stay strong.",
		"People in reasonably good health at the age of 60 can now expect to live close to thirty more years. These can be the happiest years of their lives, since the pressures of earning a living, building a career, and raising a family are behind them. Workers can use their “golden years” to do many of the things they had always hoped to do, but never had the opportunity to do because of their 40­plus­hour workweeks. Unfortunately, the cost of these additional retirement years can present a problem if there is insufficient financial preparation. Therefore, a retirement plan needs to be set in motion at an early stage of life to assure that retirement is all that it can be.",
		"We all have a tendency to look at our own flaws with a magnifying glass. If you continually tell yourself that this or that part of you is not up to standard, how can you expect it to get any better? Focus on the things you like about yourself. You will see how much better it feels to praise yourself rather than put yourself down. With this good feeling, you can do more for yourself and others than you could ever do with the negative energy of self­criticism. Choose to see the good. The choice is yours alone.",
		"Some of the words we use most frequently are not expressive. If someone asked you what you thought of a movie or your dinner, you might respond: “It was fine.” Do you mean, ‘fine’ as in ‘fine wine,’ or ‘fine art?’ Or do you mean, ‘fine’ as in ‘excellent, good, fine or poor?’ ‘Fine’ can be used to express satisfaction or disappointment. There are hundreds of words that, like ‘fine,’ express very little meaning. They are fillers. Choose words that are more expressive, like ‘great’ or ‘terrific’ or ‘wonderful’ if you want to express pleasure, and words like ‘adequate’ or ‘satisfactory’ if your intent is to communicate that the movie or meal was okay, but nothing more. These words won’t be misunderstood.",
		"Planning involves only the half of your brain that controls your logical thinking. The other intuitive half of your brain is left out of this planning process. If you insist on always having a plan, you cut yourself off from your intuitive self and the inner joy it provides. To break planning addiction, allow yourself one freedom. Decide to spend a day exploring a park or a neighborhood with curiosity as your only guide. The next time you feel attracted to someone, and want to introduce yourself, go ahead. You’ll be likely to make a new friend. By giving yourself freedom to follow your intuition, you develop your sensitivity to your inner voice. You learn to hear the quiet messages that can make your life an adventure.",
		"Merely having goals clearly defined is not sufficient, for one must also know, moment by moment, what precisely needs to be done. For instance, a salesperson’s aim is to conclude a sale profitably. However, each sale requires a different approach: Should he be pushy or laid back, authoritative or friendly? And what aspect of the product should he emphasize? The answers to these questions depend on variables that cannot be predicted in advance. This holds true not only for sales but also for most human activities. One must select a particular strategy appropriate to the occasion and follow the chosen course of action. Doing so will ensure more lasting success in reaching one’s goals.",
		"We all enjoy the pleasure of being left alone with a good book. But sometimes after several hours of immersion we lift our heads and look around, suddenly struck by the quiet, the absence of others. In this situation, we are suffering from reading­induced loneliness. The solution is to read in the company of other people who are reading—whether in a public space such as a café or a library, or in your own home, with your reading friend or partner at the other end of the sofa. Next time you look up, you’ll see someone else similarly immersed, and you won’t feel alone at all. Reading can be sociable. Consider joining a reading group in which everybody takes turns reading aloud from a novel. Reading a book collaboratively is a wonderful way to share an otherwise internal and solitary experience.",
		"When we want something badly for our children, so badly that we behave in ways that aren’t helpful for our kids, it can mean we’re trying to fulfill a need for ourselves. It’s normal to feel good when your child wins, it’s normal to want him to win, but when you need him to win in order to feel good about yourself, you have a problem. For example, do you feel like having a child who is a winner proves you’re a worthwhile parent? Do you crave the recognition of being the parent of a star athlete? If you can answer yes to either question, you may be trying to feel good about yourself through your child’s athletic accomplishments. This is a very common problem. Be willing to take an honest look at yourself. The payoff is tremendous. You become a more aware sports parent who can offer true support and encouragement to your child.",
		"Like cross-training, cross-eating adds needed variety to your life―in this case, nutritional variety. Existing on a few dietary staples like bagels, bananas, and energy bars may leave you short on the fiber, vitamins, and minerals that are crucial for health. You should expand your nutrient repertoire. You can do this by trying a new food each week, or by getting in the habit of sampling new grains or pasta dishes at your local grocery store. Go for more variety at each meal by, for example, including two steamed vegetables and two grain foods (like rice and whole-grain bread) instead of a single source of each. Having more foods at each meal will also help control portion sizes, which may keep you from overloading on fat or sodium from one particular food.",
		"Have you ever met someone while you were experiencing significant emotional, psychological, or physical stress? Perhaps you stayed up all night studying for a final, or maybe you learned that a grandparent recently died. You likely exhibited behaviors that are not consistent with how you usually act. Meeting someone when you are extremely stressed can create an inaccurate impression of you. For this reason, recognize that our first impressions of others also may be perceptual errors. To help avoid committing these errors, engage in perception checking, which means that we consider a series of questions to confirm or challenge our perceptions of others and their behaviors. For example, see if you can provide two possible interpretations for the verbal and nonverbal behavior observed and seek clarification of it in order to determine the accuracy of your evaluation.",
		"As we all know, even the best­laid plans can go astray. It is therefore important that you keep in mind the possibility of plans going wrong, and maintain flexibility in your plans. If a given strategy or allocation of resources does not succeed, then you must be ready to change to another plan or set other priorities for resource allocation. For example, one of the most damaging strategies in taking a test is that of spending too long on a given problem. Occasionally, you may find that a problem you had thought you could solve in a reasonable amount of time is taking much longer than you had anticipated. Just as you have to know when and how to start a problem, you also have to know when and how to stop. Sometimes the best decision is just to give up and to move on.",
		"My barely-five-year-old son couldn’t go to bed one night until he wrote “I love you Mom” on a piece of paper. Pajamas on, red crayon in hand, he was very determined. A few mixed-up letters, a couple of crumpled papers, and some help from Daddy later, he handed me his heart on the page. Then, finally, he relaxed enough to fall asleep. Sometimes, saying how you feel just isn’t enough. Spoken words are invisible and untouchable. Write it down, however, and you can see it, feel it, hold it, keep it forever. Although we may think it, we can’t really give someone our heart. But by writing, we can give someone our heart on a page. A love note is a piece of paper that is a little piece of your heart. Teach your child how to write love notes, and I promise you will have many, many happy returns.",
		"Pests are a concern for collection preservation and a health risk, and both issues must be addressed by a facilities management plan. Pest management starts with good housekeeping, so the museum’s overall custodial staff must be considered part of the pest management team. A program should be established that looks for likely invasion routes of pests into a museum facility and takes steps to prevent use of these routes. Efforts should be made to prevent pests from entering the museum building at points such as visitor entrances, service entrances, air intake points, food facilities, windows, and cracks and breaks in the building. Housekeeping should be concentrated at these points of entry.",
		"One of the most difficult things many successful people do is to challenge their own beliefs. Convictions that may have once been true and useful may change. Friedrich Nietzsche said it well when he said, “It’s not simply a question of having the courage of one’s convictions, but at times having the courage to attack one’s convictions.” That’s how you grow. That’s how you mature. That’s how you develop. Look at Tolstoy himself, a great example of a man who was willing to grow because he realized that he had to attack, at times, his own convictions. Socrates said it well when he said, “The unexamined life is not worth living.” But we need to add that the examined life is painful, risky, full of vulnerability. And, yet, to revitalize public conversation, we have to ensure that self-criticism and self-correction are accented in our individual lives, as well as in our society and world.",
		"Sure, we’ve all heard the advice: “Follow your passion.” It’s great when you hit the jackpot and find a career that melds your strengths and passions, and where there is demand in the highly competitive global marketplace of today. But if your goal is to get a job at the end of the rainbow, you must distinguish between your major, your passions, your strengths, and your career path. Your strengths are more important than your passions. Studies show that the best career choices tend to be grounded in things you’re good at, more so than your interests and passions. Ideally, you want to find a convergence of your strengths and your values with a career path that is in demand. Interests can come and go. Your strengths are your core, your hard-wired assets.",
		"Once you start to see praise for what it is―and what it does―these constant little evaluative outbursts from adults start to produce the same effect as fingernails being dragged down a blackboard. You begin to root for a child to give his teachers or parents a taste of their own treacle by turning around to them and saying (in the same saccharine tone of voice), “Good praising!” Still, it’s not an easy habit to break. It can seem strange, at least at first, to stop praising; it can feel as though you’re being chilly or withholding something. But that, it soon becomes clear, suggests that we praise more because we need to say it than because children need to hear it. Whenever that’s true, it’s time to rethink what we’re doing. What kids do need is unconditional support, love with no strings attached. That’s not just different from praise―it’s the opposite of praise.",
		"Suppose a child throws a ball to another child intending to start a game of catch. The other child is not watching and the ball hits the child on the head. The child cries and runs to tell the teacher about the aggressive behaviour of the other ‘naughty’ child. Of course the child who threw the ball is innocent but, if we have defined aggression in terms of pure behaviour, the consequences of an act, then the child who throws the ball is unfairly guilty. Clearly we need to take intention into account when we define aggression. We can now move to a more complete definition if we say that aggression is any behaviour that is intended to hurt others.",
		"What is your goal in writing a particular paper or giving a talk or doing a poster? You should be able to state this goal in one sentence. For example, one of Bob’s first papers as a psychology student was written to show that individual differences in children’s intelligence could not be explained by genetic factors alone. Sure, he reviewed the literature on inheritance of intelligence. And of course he reviewed the literature on environmental effects on intelligence. But he had no thesis. Good papers do not merely review literature and then say something like “there are many different points of view, all of which have something useful to say.” When you communicate via a paper, talk, or poster, be clear about what you want to show, and show it.",
		"Often the difference between feeling fulfilled at work and feeling empty, lost, annoyed, and burned out is all about whether or not you’re learning anything. This is another reason to listen. It’s amazing how much more you learn when you pause, quiet your mind, and listen to what others say. This is true for peers to your left and right as well as the very teams you lead. Sometimes it’s hard to listen to your boss or an executive, especially if you don’t agree 100 percent of the time. In some cases, you may not even like them. I get it. Remember, they’re in their roles for a reason, and they just might know a few things. Be open and willing to listen to what they say. You may not agree with everything you hear, but at least you listened. Even if you don’t agree with what they say or how they say it,",
		"We say to ourselves: “There is plenty of time. I’ll manage somehow or other when the time comes for action.” We are rather proud of our ability to meet emergencies. So we do not plan and take precautions to prevent emergencies from arising. It is too easy to drift through school and college, taking the traditional, conventional studies that others take, following the lines of least resistance, electing “snap courses,” and going with the crowd. It is too easy to take the attitude: “First I will get my education and develop myself, and then I will know better what I am fitted to do for a life work.” And so we drift, driven by the winds of circumstance, tossed about by the waves of tradition and custom. Eventually, most men find they must be satisfied with “any port in a storm.” Sailors who select a port because they are driven to it have scarcely one chance in a thousand of dropping anchor in the right one.",
		"Life is hectic. Our days are filled with so many of the “have tos” that we feel there’s no time left for the “want tos.” Further, spending all our time with others doesn’t give us the ability to hit the reset button and relax. Leaving little to no time for ourselves or for the things that are important to us can lead to unmanaged stress, frustration, fatigue, resentment, or worse, health issues. Building in regular “you time,” however, can provide numerous benefits, all of which help to make life a little bit sweeter and a little bit more manageable. Unfortunately, many individuals struggle with reaching goals due to an inability to prioritize their own needs. Alone time, however, forces you to take a break from everyday responsibilities and the requirements of others so you can dedicate time to move forward with your own goals, meet your own personal needs, and further explore your personal dreams.",
		"You know the old saying about having only one chance to make a first impression? Forget about it for once and give people a second chance. Even if you didn’t like someone’s question at yesterday’s lecture or you thought his outfit was out­of­place for the event, don’t immediately write that person off as a potential friend. This is a time in your life to dig deeper and allow yourself to find out what makes people behave the way they do. Forget about surfaces and look for what’s inside. And remember, it takes time for new friendships to develop. As you get to know each other, shared experiences and interests will become woven into the friendship. Keep working on the relationship, even if it feels uncomfortable at times.",
		"Don’t get me wrong about liberal arts. A liberal arts education can be valuable for many careers. It teaches you how to think about the problems and issues you will face in the real world. It gives you perspective, analytical and problem­solving skills, and creative strengths―which are all important in just about any career you can contemplate. Nevertheless, if you are a student, be smart. Seek out internships and take electives like statistics, programming, or business to give your liberal arts education some “teeth.” Students and young professionals alike should seek out skills and certifications that will provide more practical credentials in marketing yourself in the career world.",
		"Interactions with people are the major source of emotional stress, but it doesn’t have to be that way. The problem is that we are continually judging people, wishing they were something that they are not. We want to change them. We want them to think and act a certain way, most often the way we think and act. And because this is not possible, because everyone is different, we are continually frustrated and upset. Instead, see other people as phenomena, as neutral as comets or plants. They simply exist. They come in all varieties, making life rich and interesting. Work with what they give you, instead of resisting and trying to change them. Make understanding people a fun game, the solving of puzzles. It is all part of the human comedy. Yes, people are irrational, but so are you. Make your acceptance of human nature as radical as possible. This will calm you down and help you observe people more dispassionately, understanding them on a deeper level.",
		"Learning a certain concept such as “molecules” requires more than just a single exposure to the idea. If a student is going to remember a science concept, he or she should experience it multiple times and in various contexts. That is one of the strengths of the learning cycle: the students have direct experience with the concept, then they talk about it, and then they have even more direct experience. Reading, watching videos, and listening to others’ thoughts contribute to a more solid understanding of the concept. This suggests more than repetition. Each event allows the student to examine the concept from a different perspective. Ultimately this will lead to a substantive, useful understanding of the complexities and nuances of the concept.",
		"During a time of stress or change, as parents, we want to protect our children. This is a normal parental instinct, and it’s an appropriate behavior. But it’s during this time of protection that we, without realizing it, take power away from our children. It helps to give your child practice in making decisions. A good place to start is to ask questions to help them decide a course of action to take so they feel they did everything they could to prepare. Regrettably, at times, the plan may not go as intended, but you have to let your child experience the natural consequences and learn from these little mistakes. This is so difficult to do because we never want to see our children suffer, but these little learning",
		"Unless your company offers a class on how to give and receive feedback, don’t assume those around you, including your boss, know how to give negative feedback. They may be too aggressive. Too direct. Maybe even a little mean. Perhaps they are bad at giving feedback because no one ever taught them how. Or perhaps they’ve had bosses who were bad at giving them feedback. Try to brush aside the stuff that offends or upsets you to really try to hear what they are saying you can do better next time. And if they only tell you things like, “don’t let that happen again,” then work to figure out what you can do better next time, so that it doesn’t actually happen again. Preparing to solve a problem for next time feels better than getting upset about our failure to solve it this time.",
		"The human brain is wired to look for threats—a trait that kept us alive when we were living on the savannas but that can prevent happiness in our modern lives. This so­called “negativity bias” can keep you focused on what’s going wrong (which explains why complaining is such a popular pastime). To break out of this neural rut, train yourself to acknowledge when things go right. If you keep a calendar or a journal, make a point to write down what went well. If you’re more of a verbal processor, start your conversations with friends by sharing a recent win (anything that gives you that yesssss feeling). Where the mind goes, reality follows. The more you appreciate life, the more reasons you have to celebrate it.",
		"It’s unfortunate that when something goes wrong, people obsess about why it happened, whose fault it was, and “why me?” Honestly, what good is that thinking in most cases? Train your brain to be solution­oriented. Let’s take the simplest example on the planet. What happens when a glass of milk spills? Yes, you can obsess and say, how did that fall, who made it fall, will it stain the floor, or think something along the lines of, “Why always me? I’m in a hurry and don’t need this.” But someone with a solution­oriented thought process would simply get a towel, pick up the glass, and get a new glass of milk. Use your energy wisely; learn from mistakes but then move on fast with solutions.",
		"Occasionally individuals do not merely come out as well as clearly state what is troubling them and instead select more indirect means of expressing their annoyance. One companion might talk to the various other in a way that is condescending and also indicates underlying hostility. Numerous other times, partners may mope and even frown without genuinely dealing with an issue. Companions may likewise merely prevent discussing an issue by swiftly switching over topics when the subject turns up or by being incredibly vague. Such indirect ways of expressing temper are not useful since they don’t provide the individual that is the target of the behaviors, an idea of exactly how to react. They understand their companion is irritated, but the absence of directness leaves them without advice regarding what they can do to solve the issue.",
		"Here’s something to consider: If you have a friend whose friendship you wouldn’t recommend to your sister, or your father, or your son, why would you have such a friend for yourself? You might say: out of loyalty. Well, loyalty is not identical to stupidity. Loyalty must be negotiated, fairly and honestly. Friendship is a reciprocal arrangement. You are not morally obliged to support someone who is making the world a worse place. Quite the opposite. You should choose people who want things to be better, not worse. It’s a good thing, not a selfish thing, to choose people who are good for you. It’s appropriate and praiseworthy to associate with people whose lives would be improved if they saw your life improve.",
		"Given the right conditions, entrepreneurship can be fully woven into the fabric of campus life, greatly expanding its educational reach. One study showed that, within the workplace, peers influence each other to spot opportunities and act on them: the more entrepreneurs you have working together in an office, the more likely their colleagues will catch the bug. A study of Stanford University alumni found that those “who have varied work and educational backgrounds are much more likely to start their own businesses than those who have focused on one role at work or concentrated in one subject at school.” To cultivate an entrepreneurial culture, colleges and universities need to offer students a broad choice of experiences and wide exposure to different ideas. They are uniquely positioned to do this by combining the resources of academic programming, residential life, student groups, and alumni networks.",
		"One of the funniest things about becoming a boss is that it causes an awful lot of people to forget everything they know about how to relate to other people. If you have a complaint about somebody in your personal life, it would never occur to you to wait for a formally scheduled meeting to tell them. Yet, management has been bureaucratized to the point that we throw away effective strategies of everyday communication. Don’t let the formal processes like annual performance reviews take over. They are meant to reinforce, not substitute, what we do every day. You’d never let the fact that you go to the dentist for a cleaning a couple times a year prevent you from brushing your teeth every day.",
		"Good teachers know that learning occurs when students compare what they already know with the new ideas presented by the teacher or textbook. It is the students who decide whether or not to reconstruct their conceptions; therefore, teaching should be student centered rather than teacher centered. This means that students should be actively involved in making and interpreting analogies. If we believe that analogy use is an effective way to help students think and learn, then it makes sense to help students generate their own analogies or reconstruct the teacher’s analogies to fit in with their own experiences.",
		"More often than not, modern parents are paralyzed by the fear that they will no longer be liked or even loved by their children if they scold them for any reason. They want their children’s friendship above all, and are willing to sacrifice respect to get it. This is not good. A child will have many friends, but only two parents―if that―and parents are more, not less, than friends. Friends have very limited authority to correct. Every parent therefore needs to learn to tolerate the momentary anger or even hatred directed toward them by their children, after necessary corrective action has been taken, as the capacity of children to perceive or care about long-term consequences is very limited. Parents are the judges of society. They teach children how to behave so that other people will be able to interact meaningfully and productively with them.",
		"New ideas, such as those inspired by scientific developments, are often aired and critiqued in our popular culture as part of a healthy process of public debate, and scientists sometimes deserve the criticism they get. But the popularization of science would be greatly enhanced by improving the widespread images of the scientist. Part of the problem may be that the majority of the people who are most likely to write novels, plays, and film scripts were educated in the humanities, not in the sciences. Furthermore, the few scientists-turned-writers have used their scientific training as the source material for thrillers that further damage the image of science and scientists. We need more screenplays and novels that present scientists in a positive light. In our contemporary world, television and film are particularly influential media, and it is likely that the introduction of more scientist-heroes would help to make science more attractive.",
		"Your brain doesn’t recognize don’t. No matter what I say, don’t think of a giraffe with brown spots on it. No matter what I say, don’t think of a clear glass vase with fresh red roses in it. What happens? It’s automatic, isn’t it? Your brain goes ahead and creates the picture all by itself. Your words―whether you think, say, read, or hear them―are a direct command to create. The more direct the order, the more diligent the response. Trickily, if you say you don’t want to lose your temper, your brain doesn’t recognize don’t and sees it as a royal command to get you to lose your temper. If say you don’t want to spill your drink, it’s as good as an instruction to tip the contents. Change your words to support you. Create affirmations that suit you. Think and say precisely what you desire rather than what you don’t want.",
		"We live in a time when everyone seems to be looking for quick and sure solutions. Computer companies have even begun to advertise ways in which computers can replace parents. They are too late―television has already done that. Seriously, however, in every branch of education, including moral education, we make a mistake when we suppose that a particular batch of content or a particular teaching method or a particular configuration of students and space will accomplish our ends. The answer is both harder and simpler. We, parents and teachers, have to live with our children, talk to them, listen to them, enjoy their company, and show them by what we do and how we talk that it is possible to live appreciatively or, at least, nonviolently with most other people.",
		"We can’t begin to build a strategy for our lives without first understanding where we are and where we want to go. Since people are different, it’s reasonable to assume their current situations or starting points will be different as well. That’s why books that tout a single formula for success or improvement, without taking into account the different places people are starting from, are worthless. Would you trust a doctor who didn’t ask any questions or run any tests to diagnose what was wrong, yet wrote you a prescription anyway? In medicine, the adage is Prescription without diagnosis equals malpractice. Before we can “prescribe” strategy, we first need to diagnose the situation─where we stand, where we are today.",
		"We try to avoid uncertainty by overanalyzing. But we don’t have complete control over how the future will play out. You may feel that if you can just answer your “worry question” once and for all, you will be satisfied and you can finally drop your rumination, but has this ever actually happened to you? Has there ever been an answer that allowed you to stop worrying? There is only one way out of this spiral, and that is not to try to gain control, but to give it up. Instead of pushing back against uncertainty, embrace it. Instead of trying to answer your worry question, deliberately practice leaving it unanswered. Don’t ask others and don’t think about it. Tell yourself that analysis is not the solution, but really just more of the same problem.",
		"Conflicts between the goals of science and the need to protect the rights and welfare of human research participants result in the central ethical tension of clinical research. The statement “Bad science is bad ethics” is true. Putting humans at risk if the study design does not permit a reasonable expectation of valid findings is never ethical. Even a study that presents no risk presents at least an inconvenience to participants and is in that sense disrespectful. The statement “Good science is good ethics,” however, is false. Study design may be scientifically valid, yet the risk of harming human participants is too great to accept. Although achieving the appropriate scientific ends is always the necessary goal of a study, protection of the rights and welfare of human participants must override scientific efficiency.",
		"Consider two athletes who both want to play in college. One says she has to work very hard and the other uses goal setting to create a plan to stay on track and work on specific skills where she is lacking. Both are working hard but only the latter is working smart. It can be frustrating for athletes to work extremely hard but not make the progress they wanted. What can make the difference is drive―utilizing the mental gear to maximize gains made in the technical and physical areas. Drive provides direction (goals), sustains effort (motivation), and creates a training mindset that goes beyond simply working hard. Drive applies direct force on your physical and technical gears, strengthening and polishing them so they can spin with vigor and purpose. While desire might make you spin those gears faster and harder as you work out or practice, drive is what built them in the first place.",
		"Placing value on and investing in experiences provides us with a greater sense of vitality. Our experiences make us feel alive and give us greater opportunities to grow. Any time you consider purchasing a new possession, stop yourself and think about what kind of experience it will give you. Ask yourself: How much joy will this bring me? Will the joy be temporary or long­lasting? Will the purchase be something I can share with others? If it becomes clear the purchase will provide only short­term benefit to you, think about an experience you could purchase instead that would provide you with longer­term benefits. For instance, if you have your eye on a new pair of shoes for $150, ask yourself what kind of experience you could enjoy for that same amount. Maybe you’d enjoy a concert with friends or a dinner cruise during the summer. Once you think of an experience you’d enjoy, seriously consider diverting the money for the purchase from possession to experience.",
		"Becoming competent in another culture means looking beyond behavior to see if we can understand the attitudes, beliefs, and values that motivate what we observe. By looking only at the visible aspects of culture―customs, clothing, food, and language―we develop a short-sighted view of intercultural understanding―just the tip of the iceberg, really. If we are to be successful in our business interactions with people who have different values and beliefs about how the world is ordered, then we must go below the surface of what it means to understand culture and attempt to see what Edward Hall calls the “hidden dimensions.” Those hidden aspects are the very foundation of culture and are the reason why culture is actually more than meets the eye. We tend not to notice those cultural norms until they violate what we consider to be common sense, good judgment, or the nature of things.",
		"Bringing incredible creative projects to life demands much hard work down in the trenches of day‑to‑day idea execution. Genius truly is “1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration.” But we cannot forget the flip side of that 99 percent—it’s impossible to solve every problem by sheer force of will. We must also make time for play, relaxation, and exploration, the essential ingredients of the creative insights that help us evolve existing ideas and set new projects in motion. Often this means creating a routine for breaking from your routine, working on exploratory side projects just for the hell of it, or finding new ways to hotwire your brain’s perspective on a problem. To stay creatively fit, we must keep our minds engaged and on the move—because the greatest enemy of creativity is nothing more than standing still.",
		"There is no denying that engaging in argument carries certain significant risks. When we argue, we exchange and examine reasons with a view toward believing what our best reasons say we should believe; sometimes we discover that our current reasons fall short, and that our beliefs are not well supported after all. Or sometimes we discover that a belief that we had dismissed as silly or obviously false in fact enjoys the support of highly compelling reasons. On other occasions, we discover that the reasons offered by those with whom we disagree measure up toe­to­toe with our own reasons. In any of these situations, an adjustment in our belief is called for; we must change what we believe, or revise it, or replace it, or suspend belief altogether.",
		"Anthropology has become relevant for addressing global issues. This is not to deny the vital role of ‘hard’ sciences in addressing these problems. However, if we are to solve global problems we need a new way of thinking based in humanities and social sciences. It is impossible to resolve global issues merely by looking at numbers and statistics. Anthropology thus becomes crucial, as a discipline and a profession enabling the collection and interpretation of ‘thick data’―in addition to ‘big data’―and helps us to understand the world we live in more comprehensively. Why is a brand new and expensive ‘smart’ building a disaster? What will happen in the future with passenger cars? In answering such questions, we should stop relying only on quantitative data analytics; instead, the most important decisions should also be informed by anthropological qualitative approaches which provide a more complete and nuanced picture of people’s lives.",
		"Certain hindrances to multifaceted creative activity may lie in premature specialization, i.e., having to choose the direction of education or to focus on developing one ability too early in life. However, development of creative ability in one domain may enhance effectiveness in other domains that require similar skills, and flexible switching between generality and specificity is helpful to productivity in many domains. Excessive specificity may result in information from outside the domain being underestimated and unavailable, which leads to fixedness of thinking, whereas excessive generality causes chaos, vagueness, and shallowness. Both tendencies pose a threat to the transfer of knowledge and skills between domains. What should therefore be optimal for the development of cross-domain creativity is support for young people in taking up creative challenges in a specific domain and coupling it with encouragement to apply knowledge and skills in, as well as from, other domains, disciplines, and tasks.",
		"Leaving behind technology during intentional time alone is essential for the cognitive benefits, neurological repair, and spiritual clarity that are the gifts of solitude. Multiple studies show that anxiety is markedly reduced, and we gain benefits similar to solitude, not by simply turning our phones off but by having them not physically with us. If a phone is essential for safety during time alone, then turn off alerts, cover the screen— just tape paper right over it—and keep it somewhere that is terribly inconvenient to access. I am always surprised by how long it takes me to give up the impulse to reach for my phone, often for no reason at all, other than to “just check.” Check what? Always it is something that can do without me for the moment. It is important that we allow ourselves time to free our minds from even the possibility of constant connectivity, to “normalize deactivation,” as herbalist Sophia Rose puts it, allowing our overstimulated neuronal connections to rest and reassemble.",
		"Confident is not the same as comfortable. One of the biggest misconceptions about becoming self-confident is that it means living fearlessly. The key to building confidence is quite the opposite. It means we are willing to let fear be present as we do the things that matter to us. When we establish some self-confidence in something, it feels good. We want to stay there and hold on to it. But if we only go where we feel confident, then confidence never expands beyond that. If we only do the things we know we can do well, fear of the new and unknown tends to grow. Building confidence inevitably demands that we make friends with vulnerability because it is the only way to be without confidence for a while. But the only way confidence can grow is when we are willing to be without it. When we can step into fear and sit with the unknown, it is the courage of doing so that builds confidence from the ground up.",
		"The chemists Hans Ebel, Claus Bliefert, and William Russey note: “It goes without saying that scientists need to be skillful readers. Extensive reading is the principal key to expanding one’s knowledge and keeping up with developments in a discipline. However, what is often overlooked here is that scientists are also obliged to be skillful writers. Only the researcher who is competent in the art of written communication can play an active and effective role in contributing to science.” From the perspective of readability, moreover, scientists should always write with a reader­centered mentality; even in the act of writing they must be mindful of the act of reading. It would be beneficial for them to understand how readers read in order to improve their writing.",
		"By definition, adult learners have a self­concept of being in charge of their own lives and have a need to be seen and treated as being capable of taking responsibility for their own learning. As such, learners need to be given the freedom and autonomy to assume responsibility for their own choices and to be proactive in making decisions that contribute to their educational experiences. Rather than perform the role of the “sage on the stage,” in working with adult learners, the instructor’s role should be the “guide on the side”—a facilitator of learning, and a coach or mentor who works alongside their learners to promote achievement and academic success. The facilitator role extends beyond course delivery, and includes the broader pedagogical tasks that will support learners on their growth such as helping them effectively manage their time; fostering engagement; assigning meaningful and relevant learning activities; and so on.",
		"Having watched the older children opening their gifts, I already knew that the big gifts were not necessarily the nicest ones. One girl my age got a large coloring book of historic characters, while a less greedy girl who selected a smaller box received a beautiful hairpin. As my turn came closer, my heart beat faster with anticipation. As I looked into the sack, I quickly fingered the remaining presents, testing their weight, imagining what they contained. I chose a small but heavy one that was wrapped in shiny silver foil and a red ribbon. It was a pack of batteries, which was not a gift I wished for. I had nothing to use them with! So I spent the rest of the party watching the other kids enjoying their gifts.",
		"One day after grocery shopping, I was sitting at the bus stop. When the bus arrived, I just hopped on. Not until I got home and reached for the house key did I realize that I had left my purse on the bench at the bus stop. My heart started to beat faster because all my cash for the month was in my purse. “How can I get by without the money?” I said to myself. I rushed to catch a taxi and headed back to the bus stop. On arriving at the bus stop, I started frantically searching for my purse. Right at that moment, something caught my eye from under the bench―something familiar. It was my purse, and fortunately all my money was still in there.",
		"Garnet blew out the candles and lay down. It was too hot even for a sheet. She lay there, sweating, listening to the empty thunder that brought no rain, and whispered, “I wish the drought would end.” Late in the night, Garnet had a feeling that something she had been waiting for was about to happen. She lay quite still, listening. The thunder rumbled again, sounding much louder. And then slowly, one by one, as if someone were dropping pennies on the roof, came the raindrops. Garnet held her breath hopefully. The sound paused. “Don’t stop! Please!” she whispered. Then the rain burst strong and loud upon the world. Garnet leaped out of bed and ran to the window. She shouted with joy, “It’s raining hard!” She felt as though the thunderstorm was a present.",
		"On my seventh birthday, my mom surprised me with a puppy waiting on a leash. It had beautiful golden fur and an adorable tail. It was exactly what I had always dreamed of. I took the dog everywhere and slept with it every night. A few months later, the dog got out of the backyard and was lost. I sat on my bed and cried for hours while my mother watched me silently from the doorway of my room. I finally fell asleep, exhausted from my grief. My mother never said a word to me about my loss, but I knew she felt the same as I did.",
		"The principal stepped on stage. “Now, I present this year’s top academic award to the student who has achieved the highest placing.” He smiled at the row of seats where twelve finalists had gathered. Zoe wiped a sweaty hand on her handkerchief and glanced at the other finalists. They all looked as pale and uneasy as herself. Zoe and one of the other finalists had won first placing in four subjects so it came down to how teachers ranked their hard work and confidence. “The Trophy for General Excellence is awarded to Miss Zoe Perry,” the principal declared. “Could Zoe step this way, please?” Zoe felt as if she were in heaven. She walked into the thunder of applause with a big smile.",
		"Gregg and I had been rock climbing since sunrise and had had no problems. So we took a risk. “Look, the first bolt is right there. I can definitely climb out to it. Piece of cake,” I persuaded Gregg, minutes before I found myself pinned. It wasn’t a piece of cake. The rock was deceptively barren of handholds. I clumsily moved back and forth across the cliff face and ended up with nowhere to go......but down. The bolt that would save my life, if I could get to it, was about two feet above my reach. My arms trembled from exhaustion. I looked at Gregg. My body froze with fright from my neck down to my toes. Our rope was tied between us. If I fell, he would fall with me.",
		"Marilyn and her three­-year­-old daughter, Sarah, took a trip to the beach, where Sarah built her first sandcastle. Moments later, an enormous wave destroyed Sarah’s castle. In response to the loss of her sandcastle, tears streamed down Sarah’s cheeks and her heart was broken. She ran to Marilyn, saying she would never build a sandcastle again. Marilyn said, “Part of the joy of building a sandcastle is that, in the end, we give it as a gift to the ocean.” Sarah loved this idea and responded with enthusiasm to the idea of building another castle—this time, even closer to the water so the ocean would get its gift sooner!",
		"I board the plane, take off, and climb out into the night sky. Within minutes, the plane shakes hard, and I freeze, feeling like I’m not in control of anything. The left engine starts losing power and the right engine is nearly dead now. Rain hits the windscreen and I’m getting into heavier weather. I’m having trouble keeping up the airspeed. When I reach for the microphone to call the center to declare an emergency, my shaky hand accidentally bumps the carburetor heat levers, and the left engine suddenly regains power. I push the levers to full. Both engines backfire and come to full power. Feeling that the worst is over, I find my whole body loosening up and at ease.",
		"I was diving alone in about 40 feet of water when I got a terrible stomachache. I was sinking and hardly able to move. I could see my watch and knew there was only a little more time on the tank before I would be out of air. It was hard for me to remove my weight belt. Suddenly I felt a prodding from behind me under the armpit. My arm was being lifted forcibly. Around into my field of vision came an eye. It seemed to be smiling. It was the eye of a big dolphin. Looking into that eye, I knew I was safe. I felt that the animal was protecting me, lifting me toward the surface.",
		"Salva had to raise money for a project to help southern Sudan. It was the first time that Salva spoke in front of an audience. There were more than a hundred people. Salva’s knees were shaking as he walked to the microphone. “H-h-hello,” he said. His hands trembling, he looked out at the audience. Everyone was looking at him. At that moment, he noticed that every face looked interested in what he had to say. People were smiling and seemed friendly. That made him feel a little better, so he spoke into the microphone again. “Hello,” he repeated. He smiled, feeling at ease, and went on. “I am here to talk to you about a project for southern Sudan.”",
		"One day, Cindy happened to sit next to a famous artist in a café, and she was thrilled to see him in person. He was drawing on a used napkin over coffee. She was looking on in awe. After a few moments, the man finished his coffee and was about to throw away the napkin as he left. Cindy stopped him. “Can I have that napkin you drew on?”, she asked. “Sure,” he replied. “Twenty thousand dollars.” She said, with her eyes wide­open, “What? It took you like two minutes to draw that.” “No,” he said. “It took me over sixty years to draw this.” Being at a loss, she stood still rooted to the ground.",
		"When my mom came home from the mall with a special present for me I was pretty sure I knew what it was. I was absolutely thrilled because I would soon communicate with a new cell phone! I was daydreaming about all of the cool apps and games I was going to download. But my mom smiled really big and handed me a book. I flipped through the pages, figuring that maybe she had hidden my new phone inside. But I slowly realized that my mom had not got me a phone and my present was just a little book, which was so different from what I had wanted.",
		"One Saturday morning, Matthew’s mother told Matthew that she was going to take him to the park. A big smile came across his face. As he loved to play outside, he ate his breakfast and got dressed quickly so they could go. When they got to the park, Matthew ran all the way over to the swing set. That was his favorite thing to do at the park. But the swings were all being used. His mother explained that he could use the slide until a swing became available, but it was broken. Suddenly, his mother got a phone call and she told Matthew they had to leave. His heart sank.",
		"It was two hours before the submission deadline and I still hadn’t finished my news article. I sat at the desk, but suddenly, the typewriter didn’t work. No matter how hard I tapped the keys, the levers wouldn’t move to strike the paper. I started to realize that I would not be able to finish the article on time. Desperately, I rested the typewriter on my lap and started hitting each key with as much force as I could manage. Nothing happened. Thinking something might have happened inside of it, I opened the cover, lifted up the keys, and found the problem―a paper clip. The keys had no room to move. After picking it out, I pressed and pulled some parts. The keys moved smoothly again. I breathed deeply and smiled. Now I knew that I could finish my article on time.",
		"On one beautiful spring day, I was fully enjoying my day off. I arrived at the nail salon, and muted my cellphone so that I would be disconnected for the hour and feel calm and peaceful. I was so comfortable while I got a manicure. As I left the place, I checked my cellphone and saw four missed calls from a strange number. I knew immediately that something bad was coming, and I called back. A young woman answered and said that my father had fallen over a stone and was injured, now seated on a bench. I was really concerned since he had just recovered from his knee surgery. I rushed getting into my car to go see him.",
		"On a two­-week trip in the Rocky Mountains, I saw a grizzly bear in its native habitat. At first, I felt joy as I watched the bear walk across the land. He stopped every once in a while to turn his head about, sniffing deeply. He was following the scent of something, and slowly I began to realize that this giant animal was smelling me! I froze. This was no longer a wonderful experience; it was now an issue of survival. The bear’s motivation was to find meat to eat, and I was clearly on his menu.",
		"When I woke up in our hotel room, it was almost midnight. I didn’t see my husband nor daughter. I called them, but I heard their phones ringing in the room. Feeling worried, I went outside and walked down the street, but they were nowhere to be found. When I decided I should ask someone for help, a crowd nearby caught my attention. I approached, hoping to find my husband and daughter, and suddenly I saw two familiar faces. I smiled, feeling calm. Just then, my daughter saw me and called, “Mom!” They were watching the magic show. Finally, I felt all my worries disappear.",
		"I had never seen a beach with such white sand or water that was such a beautiful shade of blue. Jane and I set up a blanket on the sand while looking forward to our ten days of honeymooning on an exotic island. “Look!” Jane waved her hand to point at the beautiful scene before us―and her gold wedding ring went flying off her hand. I tried to see where it went, but the sun hit my eyes and I lost track of it. I didn’t want to lose her wedding ring, so I started looking in the area where I thought it had landed. However, the sand was so fine and I realized that anything heavy, like gold, would quickly sink and might never be found again.",
		"One night, my family was having a party with a couple from another city who had two daughters. The girls were just a few years older than I, and I played lots of fun games together with them. The father of the family had an amusing, jolly, witty character, and I had a memorable night full of laughter and joy. While we laughed, joked, and had our dinner, the TV suddenly broadcast an air attack, and a screeching siren started to scream, announcing the “red” situation. We all stopped dinner, and we squeezed into the basement. The siren kept screaming and the roar of planes was heard in the sky. The terror of war was overwhelming. Shivering with fear, I murmured a panicked prayer that this desperate situation would end quickly.",
		"Ryan, an eleven-year-old boy, ran home as fast as he could. Finally, summer break had started! When he entered the house, his mom was standing in front of the refrigerator, waiting for him. She told him to pack his bags. Ryan’s heart soared like a balloon. Pack for what? Are we going to Disneyland? He couldn’t remember the last time his parents had taken him on a vacation. His eyes beamed. “You’re spending the summer with uncle Tim and aunt Gina.” Ryan groaned. “The whole summer?” “Yes, the whole summer.” The anticipation he had felt disappeared in a flash. For three whole miserable weeks, he would be on his aunt and uncle’s farm. He sighed.",
		"On opening day, Isabel arrives at the cafe very early with nervous anticipation. She looks around the cafe, but she can’t shake off the feeling that something is missing. As she sets out cups, spoons, and plates, Isabel’s doubts grow. She looks around, trying to imagine what else she could do to make the cafe perfect, but nothing comes to mind. Then, in a sudden burst of inspiration, Isabel grabs her paintbrush and transforms the blank walls into landscapes, adding flowers and trees. As she paints, her doubts begin to fade. Looking at her handiwork, which is beautifully done, she is certain that the cafe will be a success. ‘Now, success is not exactly guaranteed,’ she thinks to herself, ‘but I’ll definitely get there.’",
		"Sarah, a young artist with a love for painting, entered a local art contest. As she looked at the amazing artworks made by others, her confidence dropped. She quietly thought, ‘I might not win an award.’ The moment of judgment arrived, and the judges began announcing winners one by one. It wasn’t until the end that she heard her name. The head of the judges said, “Congratulations, Sarah Parker! You won first prize. We loved the uniqueness of your work.” Sarah was overcome with joy, and she couldn’t stop smiling. This experience meant more than just winning; it confirmed her identity as an artist.",
		"Our class of 1960 was going to be returning for our momentous 50th reunion, but I had sadly stated to one of my four kids that regretfully, I was going to miss the reunion because I just couldn’t afford the trip. Then one evening my youngest daughter, Kelly, handed me an envelope and said, “Read this later.” A letter inside the envelope lectured me all about how important old friendships are at all ages and that I absolutely “must attend my 50th reunion since it is a once in a lifetime event.” Included within was a round-trip airline ticket to and from Syracuse and roughly $200 cash. The letter stated that all four siblings had met and agreed to pool their money to get me to the reunion. “And don’t even think about payback!” I sat there in stunned silence. And I wept.",
		"By the tenth frame, my heart began to race. Cory, Laura, and Gray were ahead of me, but only by a few points. The other kids were way behind us. I studied the score sheet. If I could bowl a strike in this frame, I would win the game. My hands were sweaty. I dried them off on a towel. I stepped onto the lane. I took a deep breath. Raised the ball...... Sent it rolling down the center of the lane...... And knocked down all ten pins. I had bowled a strike on my last turn. I pumped my fist in the air and came back to the bench victoriously.",
		"Anna received a cute handkerchief as a gift for her tenth birthday. Accidentally an inkpot fell onto her beloved handkerchief causing a huge ugly spot. Anna was heartbroken when she saw the hideous stain. When her uncle saw that she was gloomy, he took the stained handkerchief and by retouching the inky spot changed it into a beautiful design of a flower. Now the handkerchief was more gorgeous than before. As he handed it back to Anna, she exclaimed with joy, “Oh! Is that my handkerchief?” “Yes, it is,” assured her uncle. “It is really yours. I have changed the stain into a beautiful rose.”",
		"Rowe jumps for joy when he finds a cave because he loves being in places where so few have ventured. At the entrance he keeps taking photos with his cell phone to show off his new adventure later. Coming to a stop on a rock a few meters from the entrance, he sees the icy cave’s glittering view. He says, “Incredibly beautiful!” stretching his hand out to touch the icy wall. Suddenly, his footing gives way and he slides down into the darkness. He looks up and sees a crack of light about 20 meters above him. ‘Phone for help,’ he thinks. But he realizes there’s no service this far underground. He tries to move upward but he can’t. He calls out, “Is anyone there?” There’s no answer.",
		"Something inside told me that by now someone had discovered my escape. It chilled me greatly to think that they would capture me and take me back to that awful place. So, I decided to walk only at night until I was far from the town. After three nights’ walking, I felt sure that they had stopped chasing me. I found a deserted cottage and walked into it. Tired, I lay down on the floor and fell asleep. I awoke to the sound of a far away church clock, softly ringing seven times and noticed that the sun was slowly rising. As I stepped outside, my heart began to pound with anticipation and longing. The thought that I could meet Evelyn soon lightened my walk.",
		"Dave sat up on his surfboard and looked around. He was the last person in the water that afternoon. Suddenly something out toward the horizon caught his eye and his heart froze. It was every surfer’s worst nightmare—the fin of a shark. And it was no more than 20 meters away! He turned his board toward the beach and started kicking his way to the shore. Shivering, he gripped his board tighter and kicked harder. ‘I’m going to be okay,’ he thought to himself. ‘I need to let go of the fear.’ Five minutes of terror that felt like a lifetime passed before he was on dry land again. Dave sat on the beach and caught his breath. His mind was at ease. He was safe. He let out a contented sigh as the sun started setting behind the waves.",
		"One Friday afternoon, Ted was called to the vice president of human resources. Ted sat down, beaming in anticipation. Today was the big day and this meeting would mark a turning point in his career! Ted felt sure that it was for his promotion and that the vice president would make him the marketing manager. “Ted, there is no easy way to say this.” Ted suddenly realized this meeting wasn’t going to be as he expected. Ted’s mind went blank. The vice president continued, “Ted, I know you’ve desperately wanted this promotion, but we decided Mike is more suitable.” Ted just sat there, frozen. He felt as if he had been hit by a truck. Don’t panic. All he was able to do was repeat that sentence over and over to himself.",
		"Chaske, a Cherokee boy, was sitting on a tree stump. As a rite of passage for youths in his tribe, Chaske had to survive one night in the forest wearing a blindfold, not knowing he was observed by his father. After the sunset, Chaske could hear all kinds of noises. The wind blew the grass and shook his stump. A sense of dread swept through his body. What if wild beasts are looking at me? I can’t stand this! Just as he was about to take off the blindfold to run away, a voice came in from somewhere. “I’m here around you. Don’t give up, and complete your mission.” It was his father’s voice. He has been watching me from nearby! With just the presence of his father, the boy regained stability. What panicked him awfully a moment ago vanished into thin air.",
		"Recently, while cycling to work, I had my first flat. So I borrowed a pump from a passing cyclist and discovered that the tube was useless. Then I heard someone shouting at me, “What happened?” I turned around and saw the smiling face of another cyclist. I explained my situation to him, to which he replied, “I’ll buy the tube for you.” I gave him the money and he got on his way. Within 20 minutes my savior was back-but the tube he’d bought didn’t fit. He willingly turned around for another trip. After half an hour he was back with the full kit and in no time I was good to go. Since that day, I’ve been on the lookout for other cyclists in trouble so that I can repay my debt.",
		"On December 6th, I arrived at University Hospital in Cleveland at 10:00 a.m. I went through the process of admissions. I grew anxious because the time for surgery was drawing closer. I was directed to the waiting area, where I remained until my name was called. I had a few hours of waiting time. I just kept praying. At some point in my ongoing prayer process, before my name was called, in the midst of the chaos, an unbelievable peace embraced me. All my fear disappeared! An unbelievable peace overrode my emotions. My physical body relaxed in the comfort provided, and I looked forward to getting the surgery over with and working hard at recovery.",
		"There was no choice next morning but to turn in my private reminiscence of Belleville. Two days passed before Mr. Fleagle returned the graded papers, and he returned everyone’s but mine. I was anxiously expecting for a command to report to Mr. Fleagle immediately after school for discipline when I saw him lift my paper from his desk and rap for the class’s attention. “Now, boys,” he said, “I want to read you an essay. This is titled ‘The Art of Eating Spaghetti.’” And he started to read. My words! He was reading my words out loud to the entire class. What’s more, the entire class was listening attentively. Then somebody laughed, then the entire class was laughing, and not in contempt and ridicule, but with openhearted enjoyment. I did my best to avoid showing pleasure, but what I was feeling was pure ecstasy at this startling demonstration that my words had the power to make people laugh.",
		"I walked up to the little dark brown door and knocked. Nobody answered. I pushed on the door carefully. When the door swung open with a rusty creak, a man was standing in a back corner of the room. My hands flew over my mouth as I started to scream. He was just standing there, watching me! As my heart continued to race, I saw that he had also put his hands over his mouth. Wait a minute...... It was a mirror! I took a deep breath and walked past a table to the old mirror that stood in the back of the room. I felt my heartbeat returning to normal, and calmly looked at my reflection in the mirror.",
		"I rode my bicycle alone from work on the very quiet road of my hometown. Suddenly, I noticed a man with long hair secretly riding behind me. I felt my heart jump. I quickened my legs pushing the pedals, hoping to ride faster. He kept following me through the dark, across the field. At last, I got home and tried to reach the bell. The man reached for me. I turned my head around and saw the oddest face in the world. From deep in his throat, I heard him say, “Excuse me, you dropped your bag,” giving the bag back to me. I couldn’t say anything, but was full of shame and regret for misunderstanding him.",
		"Alice looked up from her speech for the first time since she began talking. She hadn’t dared to break eye contact with the words on the pages until she finished, for fear of losing her place. Actually, she’d just hoped for two simple things―not to lose the ability to read during the talk and to get through it without making a fool of herself. Now the entire ballroom was standing, clapping. It was more than she had hoped for. Smiling brightly, she looked at the familiar faces in the front row. Tom clapped and cheered and looked like he could barely keep himself from running up to hug and congratulate her. She couldn’t wait to hug him, too.",
		"Ester stood up as soon as she heard the hum of a hover engine outside. “Mail,” she shouted and ran down the third set of stairs and swung open the door. It was pouring now, but she ran out into the rain. She was facing the mailbox. There was a single, unopened letter inside. She was sure this must be what she was eagerly waiting for. Without hesitation, she tore open the envelope. She pulled out the paper and unfolded it. The letter said, ‘Thank you for applying to our company. We would like to invite you to our internship program. We look forward to seeing you soon.’ She jumped up and down and looked down at the letter again. She couldn’t wait to tell this news to her family.",
		"It was time for the results of the speech contest. I was still skeptical whether I would win a prize or not. My hands were trembling due to the anxiety. I thought to myself, ‘Did I work hard enough to outperform the other participants?’ After a long wait, an envelope was handed to the announcer. She tore open the envelope to pull out the winner’s name. My hands were now sweating and my heart started pounding really hard and fast. “The winner of the speech contest is Josh Brown!” the announcer declared. As I realized my name had been called, I jumped with joy. “I can’t believe it. I did it!” I exclaimed. I felt like I was in heaven. Almost everybody gathered around me and started congratulating me for my victory.",
		"My 10­-year­-old appeared, in desperate need of a quarter. “A quarter? What on earth do you need a quarter for?” My tone bordered on irritation. I didn’t want to be bothered with such a trivial demand. “There’s a garage sale up the street, and there’s something I just gotta have! It only costs a quarter. Please?” I placed a quarter in my son’s hand. Moments later, a little voice said, “Here, Mommy, this is for you.” I glanced down at the hands of my little son and saw a four­-inch cream­-colored statue of two small children hugging one another. Inscribed at their feet were words that read It starts with ‘L’ ends with ‘E’ and in between are ‘O’ and ‘V.’ As I watched him race back to the garage sale, I smiled with a heart full of happiness. That 25­cent garage sale purchase brought me a lot of joy.",
		"While backpacking through Costa Rica, Masami found herself in a bad situation. She had lost all of her belongings, and had only $5 in cash. To make matters worse, because of a recent tropical storm, all telephone and Internet services were down. She had no way to get money, so decided to go knocking door to door, explaining that she needed a place to stay until she could contact her family back in Japan to send her some money. Everybody told her they had no space or extra food and pointed her in the direction of the next house. It was already dark when she arrived at a small roadside restaurant. The owner of the restaurant heard her story and really empathized. Much to her delight, Masami was invited in. The owner gave her some food, and allowed her to stay there until she could contact her parents.",
		"Dan and I were supposed to make a presentation that day. Right after the class started, my phone buzzed. It was a text from Dan saying, “I can’t make it on time. There’s been a car accident on the road!” I almost fainted. ‘What should I do?’ Dan didn’t show up before our turn, and soon I was standing in front of the whole class. I managed to finish my portion, and my mind went blank for a few seconds, wondering what to do. ‘Hold yourself together!’ I quickly came to my senses and worked through Dan’s part of the presentation as best as I could. After a few moments, I finished the entire presentation on my own. Only then did the tension vanish. I could see our professor’s beaming face.",
		"Jill is driving her two young sons to the movies. After the third time that the kids have quarreled, she pulls over the car, turns around, and screams at them at the top of her lungs: “ENOUGH! One more word and nobody goes to the movies!” After seeing the frightened looks on the children’s faces and feeling the aftermath of the hurricane that just overtook her, she drives to the movies in a state of shock and disbelief. The kids were just being kids, she thinks. How could I have lost it and scared them so badly? Jill finds herself feeling overwhelmed, exhausted, and pretty guilty for the rest of the trip.",
		"My father’s face was stern as he watched me slowly climb down from the kitchen roof. “Explain yourself, son.” His commanding voice was so full of authority it made me stand up straight like a tin soldier. What could I say in my own defence? I replied, “We don’t have a Christmas tree. All I wanted was to make one. I am truly sorry, Father.” My heart was racing so fast I could barely hear myself talking. I waited for my father to calculate the severity of punishment. And then he looked away for a moment, and I realized his stern look had melted from his face, and there was a smile on his lips. He came closer. I relaxed as he stroked my head and affectionately said, “Well done, my boy. Well done!”",
		"Mary held my hand and made me follow her. With my eyes blindfolded, I was wondering to what fantastic place she was taking me. She stopped me suddenly and played my all­-time favorite song: When the Stars Go Blue. I took a deep, shaky breath. When Mary pulled off my blindfold, my jaw dropped and I gasped at the sight before me. We were on a hill. There were no city lights anywhere in sight. The only things giving off light were the moon and the stars. Mary took my hand in hers again. The next thing I knew was that we were dancing, staring into each other’s eyes. I wished the night would last forever.",
		"We had decided to get away from the bombs, but the buses didn’t move. We waited and waited, but they didn’t go anywhere. It became so dark while we were sitting on the bus that we began to shiver at the sense of dread. I felt like a bomb was going to fall on us or that soldiers were going to come in. All of a sudden, I heard the loud sound of engines, and the buses started moving. I thought it was a dream. We drove for about thirty minutes, and then out the window I could see a big crowd of people who were waiting for us. Mommy said they were people who were going to help us. I almost couldn’t even believe it―we were safe.",
		"I was waiting outside when the exam grades were posted on the bulletin board. I was perspiring. My heart started beating fast. What if I failed? A swarm of students rushed forward to see the exam results. Fortunately, I was tall enough to see over their heads. The minute I saw the results, all my anxiety disappeared. I walked quickly back to my dormitory and phoned my father. “Dad,” I mumbled in a haze. “You won’t believe this, but I passed the exams.” My father was speechless. Finally he said, “Son, that is good news. I frankly never thought you’d do it.” I was overjoyed as if I were walking on the cloud.",
		"As Farish and I walked, brown sandstones gave way to pink limestones, which was a promising sign that fossils were in the neighborhood. After we spent a few minutes peering at rocks, alarm bells went off; my attention was pulled to an unusual faint light flashing from a corner of a melon­-sized rock. My heart pounded hard. Experience in the field taught me to respect the sensation triggered by these moments. I spent about five minutes curled up with the rock close to my eyes before passing it to Farish for his expert opinion. Farish froze solid. His eyes shot back to me with a look of suppressed emotion, disbelief, and surprise. “Yes, we found it!” I cried. Jumping with joy, I hugged him.",
		"The day for my teaching evaluation arrived. The principal was present to grade my teaching. My heart pounded heavily. I said a little prayer quietly before stepping into the classroom. As I entered the classroom, the tense atmosphere turned into wild laughter. I stood at the front of the classroom wearing my funny dress instead of my formal work clothes, which helped me to get the students’ attention. I took a deep breath and started the language activity with a catchy song that students love. Soon, the magic took off and all the students were blown away. When the class ended, all the students and even the principal started clapping. The class was a success! All my time and effort had finally paid off.",
		"After going through her routine chores as a nanny, Melanie realized how quiet the house was without Edith and Harry stirring around in it. She realized that she couldn’t hear any noise other than the ones she made. She missed Edith. She missed Harry. She felt alone in this big house without the twins. Suddenly she realized that she’d never been in any other rooms except her bedroom and the twins’. It occurred to her that the study upstairs was always kept closed. She wondered what interesting things would be there. Books? Magazines? Perhaps...... a beautiful painting? She couldn’t resist herself and started heading up the stairs.",
		"‘How much farther to the finish line? Can I make it?’ Emma felt pain in her legs and was breathing heavily. She couldn’t remember ever being so exhausted. Feeling frustrated, she began to think about giving up on the race. She knew she would regret it later, but it seemed like there was nothing she could do. Then, she remembered a strategy she had learned. By having strong imagery control, she could help herself achieve her goal. Over and over, Emma imagined herself running smoothly and breathing easily. It was working! She started to feel better. About thirty minutes later, she found herself crossing the finish line with a big smile on her face. Surrounded by cheering friends, she enjoyed her victory full of joy.",
		"Daddy hums as he packs our car with suitcases and a cooler full of snacks. We leave when the sky is still dark with sleep. Sister closes her eyes, but mine stay wide open. “Alan,” Momma says after a while, “you better catch some sleep while you can.” I try to rest, but can’t stop smiling. Soon I’ll get to see my great­-grandma Granny and hang out with my cousins. But when I look at my hands, empty as the road in front of us, my grin fades. The anniversary celebration. I bet everyone will bring something to share except me. I have nothing prepared for Granny. I’m suddenly overwhelmed with worries.",
		"It was two hours before the paper submission. With the deadline close at hand, Claire was still struggling with her writing. Pressed for time and stuck in a deadlock, she had no idea how to finish the paper. She wasn’t even sure whether she could submit it on time. What she found in her paper was scribbled words, half sentences, and a pile of seemingly strange and disjointed ideas. “Nothing makes sense,” she said to herself. She looked at her writing and began reading it over and over. All of a sudden and unexpectedly, something was found in that pile of thoughts: the flow and connection of ideas she had not considered while she was writing. From this moment, the ticking of the clock sounded encouraging to her. “Yes, I can do it!” Claire said as she grabbed her pencil again.",
		"The hotel lobby was elegant and well lit. Good, light brown woodwork and stainless steel. A short metro carriage runs through this place carrying executives. I am well dressed in a charcoal colour suit with a matching tie and black shoes. I feel great thinking I am fitted out to charm any crowd. But I forget where I’ve left my briefcase and laptop. I stop the metro and tell them that I need to check for my bag in their glass bag carriage. I find all sorts of bags except mine. I doubt whether I have brought it with me to this country at all. Mr nice guy that I am, I don’t like to keep others waiting. I let the metro move which moves quickly and is almost out of sight when I realise that one of my expensive shoes is missing! I must have left it in the cabin while looking for the bag and the metro has left. I feel myself blushing.",
		"“Regularity is the key to mastery, Jean. Everything other than that is a waste of time,” stressed Ms. Baker, Jean’s piano teacher, with a troubled look. However, Jean complained quite often about practicing and slipped out of her sessions occasionally. Concerned about Jean idling around, Ms. Baker decided to change her teaching method. “You can make your own schedule, Jean. However, I want you to help me as an assistant,” said Ms. Baker. After that, Jean practiced hard to be a good example to the beginners and her skills improved incredibly day after day. The change in Jean was miraculous. A smile came over Ms. Baker’s face as she listened to Jean play. Ms. Baker was convinced by Jean’s improvement that her new teaching method was a success.",
		"Rachel loved watching birds in the woods. However, she was confined to the house because of a broken leg. She turned on the TV but nothing was interesting. She tried to read a book but it was not fun at all. All she could do was sit, look at her broken leg, and watch the clock. As she was listening to the dull tick-tock of the clock, her phone vibrated. It was a message with an audio file from her dad. As she opened it, a huge smile spread across her face. Her dad had sent a recording of a little wren’s song―her favorite bird song. Listening to the bright warm sounds lifted her spirits and made her day more pleasant.",
		"Sharon received a ticket to an upcoming tango concert from her friend. While surfing the Internet, she came across a review for the concert. The reviewer was harsh, calling it “an awful performance.” That raised in Sharon’s mind the question of whether it was worthwhile to go, but in the end, she reluctantly decided to attend the concert. The hall located in the old town was ancient and run-down. Looking around, Sharon again wondered what kind of show she could expect. But as soon as the tango started, everything changed. The piano, guitar, flute, and violin magically flew out in harmony. The audience cheered. “Oh my goodness! What fantastic music!” Sharon shouted. The rhythm and tempo were so energetic and sensational that they shook her body and soul. The concert was far beyond her expectations.",
		"The day of the Five Mile Fun Walk had arrived. Annette had been waiting for Reiner at the registration point for over an hour. There was still no sign of him. She started thinking that something bad might have happened to him. Getting concerned, she tried calling Reiner’s phone again, but there was no response. At that moment, she heard a voice calling her name. She found Reiner coming toward her. “Thank goodness! What happened?” she asked. He explained that the traffic had been terrible. What was worse, he had left his phone at home. “I’m so sorry,” he said. She started to relax. “I’m fine now. As long as you’re here and safe. Why don’t we go and register?” They headed into the event together.",
		"As Natalie was logging in to her first online counseling session, she wondered, “How can I open my heart to the counselor through a computer screen?” Since the counseling center was a long drive away, she knew that this would save her a lot of time. Natalie just wasn’t sure if it would be as helpful as meeting her counselor in person. Once the session began, however, her concerns went away. She actually started thinking that it was much more convenient than expected. She felt as if the counselor were in the room with her. As the session closed, she told him with a smile, “I’ll definitely see you online again!”",
		"Off I went in the dark, headed to the top of Kilimanjaro. Some sections were so steep that I had to make zigzags to make it easy on my oxygen deprived body. All the energy I had went to breathing. My body felt like a dead weight. I almost gave up, with the summit just around the corner. My guide responded to my exhaustion, saying, “Go slow and steady, just one step at a time”. I followed his words. I made it to Uhuru Peak, known as the very top of Kilimanjaro. Indeed, I saw the incredible, unforgettable sunrise! The beauty, the teamwork, and the accomplishment of a personal life goal were worth all the sacrifice and strain. Mt. Kilimanjaro was worth the climb!",
		"Finally, it came to my turn. I was supposed to walk backward off the cliff. Just looking down the cliff made my legs begin to shake. I knew there was a safety rope around me in case I should black out. I had an intellectual understanding of the whole situation and an intellectual sense of security. Nevertheless, my hair stood on end and I shivered all over. That first step off the cliff was the most difficult moment, but I made it - as did others. I arrived safely at the bottom, overjoyed by the success of meeting the challenge. I felt as though I was walking on air.",
		"As he stepped onto the basketball court, David suddenly thought of the day he had gotten injured last season and froze. He was not sure if he could play as well as before the injury. A serious wrist injury had caused him to miss the rest of the season. Remembering the surgery, he said to himself, “I thought my basketball career was completely over.” However, upon hearing his fans’ wild cheers, he felt his body coming alive and thought, “For sure, my fans, friends, and family are looking forward to watching me play today.” As soon as the game started, he was filled with energy. The first five shots he attempted went in the basket. “I’m back! I got this,” he shouted.",
		"Karim was deep within the dense forest alone. He began to notice the strangeness of his surroundings. Scared, he hid under a tree, and he heard the “thump-thump” sound. Moments later, he saw a large elephant running toward him! He trembled uncontrollably and could hardly move. Suddenly, he remembered what he had read about elephants: Elephants are scared of loud noises. He also thought of the firecrackers in his pack. Quick as a flash, he lit them. The firecrackers burst with a loud noise, scaring away the elephant. Then, Karim ran away as fast as he could. By the time he reached his campsite, he was sure there was nothing dangerous around him. He could finally breathe easily. He put his hand on his chest, feeling his heartbeat slow back to its normal pace.",
		"The island tour bus Jessica was riding on was moving slowly toward the ocean cliffs. Outside, the sky was getting dark. Jessica sighed with concern, “I’m going to miss the sunset because of the traffic.” The bus arrived at the cliffs’ parking lot. While the other passengers were gathering their bags, Jessica quickly got off the bus and she ran up the cliff that was famous for its ocean views. She was about to give up when she got to the top. Just then she saw the setting sun and it still shone brightly in the sky. Jessica said to herself, “The glow of the sun is so beautiful. It’s even better than I expected.”",
		"I was going to a conference and my plane was delayed, so by the time I got to my hotel everyone I was supposed to meet had already left for the conference. I walked to the bus stop, but to my dismay the last shuttle to the convention center had already gone. I was at a loss as to what to do! Then a young man standing on the sidewalk said, “The convention center isn’t very far. It’s only four blocks.” So I started walking. It wasn’t long before the convention center appeared in front of my eyes. My heart slowly calmed down! Fortunately, I was just in time for the conference!",
		"Mark was participating in freestyle swimming competitions in this Olympics. He had a firm belief that he could get a medal in the 200m. Swimming was dominated by Americans at the time, so Mark was dreaming of becoming a national hero for his country, Britain. That day, Mark was competing in his very last race—the final round of the 200m. He had done his training and was ready. One minute and fifty seconds later, it was all over. He had tried hard and, at his best, was ranked number four. He fell short of a bronze medal by 0.49 of a second. And that was the end of Mark’s swimming career. He was heartbroken. He had nothing left.",
		"“Daddy!” Jenny called, waving a yellow crayon in her little hand. Nathan approached her, wondering why she was calling him. Jenny, his three-year-old toddler, was drawing a big circle on a piece of paper. “What are you doing, Sweetie?” Nathan asked with interest. She just kept drawing without reply. He continued watching her, wondering what she was working on. She was drawing something that looked like a face. When she finished it, Jenny shouted, “Look, Daddy!” She held her artwork up proudly. Taking a closer look, Nathan recognized that it was his face. The face had two big eyes and a beard just like his. He loved Jenny’s work. Filled with joy and happiness, Nathan gave her a big hug.",
		"“5,000 dollars has been deposited? Thank you. I’ll check it out now.” Jerry Shaw hung up with a smile on his face. Humming, he headed to the bank to withdraw some cash. He stopped at the ATM, inserted the card and entered his PIN. The screen flashed the message, “Card not valid ― please see a teller.” What? My bonus was deposited just now! Entering the bank, Jerry told the teller what had happened. She studied the screen and frowned. “Mr. Shaw, your account was closed. All your funds were withdrawn when you closed it,” she said. “What do you mean? I never did! It must be identity theft!” yelled Jerry, his voice barely under control.",
		"While the mechanic worked on her car, Jennifer walked back and forth in the waiting room. She was deeply concerned about how much it was going to cost to get her car fixed. Her car’s engine had started making noises and kept losing power that morning, and she had heard that replacing an engine could be very expensive. After a few minutes, the mechanic came back into the waiting room. “I’ve got some good news. It was just a dirty spark plug. I already wiped it clean and your car is as good as new.” He handed her the bill and when she checked it, the overall cost of repairs came to less than ten dollars. That was far less than she had expected and she felt at ease, knowing she could easily afford it.",
		"Susan’s daughter Carrie is a special needs kid. She goes to a special school, special camp, special therapists. One day, out of the blue, she asked Susan if she could go get a slice of pizza on her own, not far from their apartment. Anxious, Susan said, “Well...... why not get the pizza and bring it home to eat?” “No!” said Carrie, sixteen at the time. “Other people eat at the pizza place, and I want to, too!” Susan was concerned, but said okay, and Carrie went off by herself a block or two away. After a while, Carrie came back, grinning. “You made it! What made you want to do this?” Susan asked. Carrie had seen her friend Izzy on TV talking about his subway ride. “I thought if he could do it, I could do it too.” Susan’s heart swelled, realizing her daughter was braver and much more grown­up than she thought.",
		"I hurried to the bus terminal to return home for Christmas. As soon as I arrived at the terminal, I saw my bus pulling away. I called out and ran after the bus, but it was too late. I felt a wave of disappointment wash over me as I realized that I would have to wait three hours for the next bus. I must have been visibly upset because a woman came over, took my arm, and led me to the street. She called a taxi and gave the driver a five­-dollar bill. She told him to take me to the ferry terminal, because the bus made a stop there before heading out onto the highway. She also wished me a Merry Christmas, and all I could do was smile. I couldn’t believe what she had done for me, a complete stranger!",
		"The piece of wreckage Anna held on to that served as a life preserver had a window. Now that there was light, she looked through it and down into the water. She wished she hadn’t. She spied dark shapes moving beneath her. What could they be? Fish? Sharks? Anna shook with fear, her blood running cold. The last bits of strength were draining away from her arms and upper body. She did not know how much longer she could hang on, but then Anna glanced up and couldn’t believe what she saw. A fishing boat was approaching over the big waves. After being in the water for 3 hours, she was finally rescued. When she got on the boat, she felt a sense of relief spread through her body.",
		"The day trip to Midtown scheduled for today was canceled because the road leading there was blocked by heavy snow. “Luck just didn’t run my way. Sightseeing in Midtown was why I signed up for this trip ......” Nancy said to herself, with a long sigh. She was thinking of all the interesting sights she wouldn’t be able to enjoy. All of a sudden, there was a knock at the door. “News! We are going to the Pland Zoo near the hotel. We will meet in the lobby soon.” It was the voice of her tour guide. She sprung off the couch and started putting on her coat in a hurry. “The Pland Zoo! That’s on my bucket list! What a turn of fortune!” shouted Nancy.",
		"At the opposite side of the valley, a narrow steep road led into the sloping hills. Along this road there now appeared two round glaring eyes. They would appear and disappear and appear again, each time rounder, more glaring, larger. Cusi was terrified. It must be an animal from another world. The lights came nearer and nearer with a strange noise and a still stranger smell. Then they disappeared completely. Chuto quietly laughed, looking down at Cusi’s set face. “Come,” he said to the boy. Cusi made himself follow the old Inca man across the terraces to the beginning of the road. “They call this thing a truck,” Chuto explained. “It won’t hurt you. It has wheels instead of feet. It has a motor instead of a heart. It has bad-smelling blood by the name of gasoline.” Cusi could finally catch his breath and feel more at ease.",
		"Joseph Bell was a top­-class violinist in the world. One day a reporter suggested an experiment to Joseph for a newspaper cover story designed to test Joseph’s musical ability to influence people. But there was one condition: people should not know who he was. Joseph was sure of his musical ability to touch others’ hearts and accepted his proposal without hesitation. On a Friday morning at rush hour, Joseph took his Stradivarius violin, for which he’d paid more than $3 million, and headed to the L’Enfant plaza subway stop in Washington, D.C. He set up shop between an entrance and an escalator, opened his violin case to take donations, seeded it with $20 of his own, and began to perform several complex classical pieces expecting himself surrounded by many pedestrians in a minute. Over the course of his forty­-three­-minute performance, more than one thousand people passed within a few feet of him. Among them, only one stopped to listen. As time went by, the violin sound faded and he slowly packed up walking away with only $1 earned.",
		"I went to a local hardware store and purchased my first barbeque. I didn’t consider the size of the box relative to the size of my tiny car. However I tried, it wouldn’t fit. Being new to the area, I didn’t have many people I could call to help. As the store clerk and I stood in front of the store scratching our heads, a man in a big pickup truck pulled up in front of us. He too was picking up a barbeque and without being prompted, offered to throw mine next to his in the back of his truck and follow me home. He wouldn’t even let me tip him. He just pulled up in my driveway, unloaded the box, waved, and quietly drove away. Mister, you made my week!",
		"Stepping up to the microphone, Gabby could feel the sweat starting to run down her face and neck. She tried to take a deep breath, but couldn’t. As her name was called, Gabby became more afraid of speaking before a large audience. Then, she suddenly remembered the words of a woman who had gradually overcome the same fear: “Fear, rapid heartbeat, quick breathing, and sweating are simply the body’s declaration that we are ready to fight.” Recalling this, Gabby calmed down and remembered clearly what she had to say. Assured, Gabby smiled and started to deliver her speech. The words flowed out like water, and her beating heart gave her more and more mental strength. The performance was successful. She had overcome her fear.",
		"When she heard the dogs barking fiercely on the floor just above her, she trembled uncontrollably for fear of being caught. Drops of cold sweat rolled down her back. Before slipping into the hold of the boat, she had scattered powder, which Swedish scientists had developed, unnoticeably on the floor above in order to distract the dogs. But she knew that these dogs were so well trained that they could smell her, even though a load of fish had been dumped over her hiding place. She held her hands together tightly and tried not to make any noise. She was not sure how long she could stay like that. To her relief, it wasn’t long before a whistle called the dogs out, leaving her unfound. She relaxed her hands and exhaled a deep breath. She felt safe now.",
		"Amy was in the classroom staring out of the window beside her. She thought how her gloomy face in the window reflected her mistake. She tried not to think about her terrible performance in class. Watching Amy look so discouraged, Laurie, her best friend, decided she needed some cheering up. So Laurie crossed her eyes and made a stupid face. Amy tried not to look, but Laurie was making another funny face. This time she couldn’t help turning back to see what her friend was doing. It was her famous fish face: she was pushing her ears out, crossing her eyes, and opening her mouth wide. Amy laughed hard. She felt that she was lucky to have a friend that could always cheer her up when she was feeling down.",
		"It was a long day, which included picking up my teenager. On our way home, we stopped at the local grocery store to get some fruits and vegetables. After unloading our cart at the checkout I realized that my wallet was not in my purse. I didn’t know what to do. Without any hesitation, the lady in front of me said, “Put it through, I’ll take care of it.” I hesitated and hesitated, but she insisted. I asked about how to pay her back and she said I could leave it with the staff in an envelope for “Ann from The Crimson Company.” She didn’t ask for my name or phone number — not a thing. For my son and me, it was a lovely gift to start off the new year. She reminded me that life is too short to not lend a helping hand when the opportunity arises.",
		"Before I could get off my horse, I heard a disturbing sound. Charlie heard it, too. He stopped abruptly and backed quickly away from the sound. The rattling sound seemed to echo down the river. As I turned my head, I caught a glimpse of a brown and gray curled creature. The rattlesnake was in position to strike. Fear gripped my heart and it pounded furiously. My hands began to sweat and my legs were trembling. I knew any slight movement might make the deadly snake strike. I had only one choice: to get Charlie out of danger. He had the same idea. He spun quickly, avoiding the rattlesnake’s attack. As we reached a safe distance, my heart rate began to slow to its regular rhythm. I patted Charlie’s head and said, “Good boy. You saved my life.”",
		"When my turn came, I was very confident. It was as if I knew, without a doubt, that the talented side of me really did exist. I had no fear whatsoever, no nervousness. I looked out over the audience, and I started to play. It was so beautiful. I was so caught up in how lovely I looked that at first I didn’t worry how I would sound. So it was a surprise to me when I hit the first wrong note and I realized something didn’t sound quite right. And then I hit another, and another followed that. A chill started at the top of my head and began to spread. Yet I couldn’t stop playing, as though my hands were bewitched. I played this strange mess through two repeats, the sour notes staying with me all the way to the end.",
		"A tear rolled down Lindsay’s cheek. She thought she had put her favorite toy, Blue Bunny, in her bag before school this morning. She had ‘show and tell’ in class today, and she was anxious. Her teacher, Mrs. Cline, might be angry that she had forgotten to bring it. She quickly searched the classroom and checked her bag one more time. Her precious Blue Bunny was a gift from her father, who worked overseas. It was nowhere to be found. Just then, Mrs. Cline appeared in the doorway. “Mrs. Cline!” Lindsay cried. “I can’t find my toy to show in class today. I’m sorry!” Mrs. Cline smiled gently. She was holding the toy. “Oh, Mrs. Cline! Thank you. I thought I had lost Blue Bunny!” Lindsay felt calm and comforted now that she had her toy again.",
		"One time, my boss and I were sitting around the table and I pitched an idea about the trend of screenplays being published and sold as literature. My boss approved it. It was the first time she had given me the go­-ahead to report and write a feature. It meant a lot to me that I’d possibly have my name on a longer piece. I felt so happy that I set about the work immediately. I wrote a draft, which was of course open to making revisions. My boss reviewed it and just said, “No, this isn’t working.” She didn’t say why or offer advice about how to fix it. I knew that the first draft wouldn’t be perfect; still, I wasn’t prepared for such an instant rejection. It was almost as if she drained my energy and enthusiasm.",
		"All smiling, Breaden, a cute three-year-old boy, was walking along the aisle of snacks, bars, and sweets. It was the aisle of all kinds of temptation for him. “Wow!” he exclaimed. Right in front of his eyes were rows of delicious-looking chocolate bars waiting to be touched. His mom was holding his hand. Breaden, her only child, had always been the focus of her attention and she was cautious not to lose him in the market. Suddenly, she stopped to say hello to her friends. Breaden stopped, too. With his eyes wide open and his mouth watering, Breaden stretched out his arm and was about to grab a bar when he felt a tight grip on his hand. He looked up. “Breaden, not today!” He knew what that meant. “Okay, Mommy,” he sighed. His shoulders fell.",
		"The start of the boat tour was far from what I had expected. None of the wildlife I saw was exotic. I could only see dull gray rocks. It was also so hot and humid that I could not enjoy the tour fully. However, as the boat slid into the Bay Park Canal, all of a sudden my mother shouted, “Look at the mangroves!” A whole new world came into sight. The mangrove forest alongside the canal thrilled me as we entered its cool shade. I was fascinated by the beautiful leaves and flowers of the mangroves. But best of all, I was charmed by the native birds, monkeys, and lizards moving among the branches. “What a wonderful adventure!” I exclaimed.",
		"The waves were perfect for surfing. Dave, however, just could not stay on his board. He had tried more than ten times to stand up but never managed it. He felt that he would never succeed. He was about to give up when he looked at the sea one last time. The swelling waves seemed to say, “Come on, Dave. One more try!” Taking a deep breath, he picked up his board and ran into the water. He waited for the right wave. Finally, it came. He jumped up onto the board just like he had practiced. And this time, standing upright, he battled the wave all the way back to shore. Walking out of the water joyfully, he cheered, “Wow, I did it!”",
		"Looking out the bus window, Jonas could not stay calm. He had been looking forward to this field trip. It was the first field trip for his history course. His history professor had recommended it to the class, and Jonas had signed up enthusiastically. He was the first to board the bus in the morning. The landscape looked fascinating as the bus headed to Alsace. Finally arriving in Alsace after three hours on the road, however, Jonas saw nothing but endless agricultural fields. The fields were vast, but hardly appealed to him. He had expected to see some old castles and historical monuments, but now he saw nothing like that awaiting him. “What can I learn from these boring fields?” Jonas said to himself with a sigh.",
		"Once again, I had lost the piano contest to my friend. When I learned that Linda had won, I was deeply troubled and unhappy. My body was shaking with uneasiness. My heart beat quickly and my face became reddish. I had to run out of the concert hall to settle down. Sitting on the stairs alone, I recalled what my teacher had said. “Life is about winning, not necessarily about winning against others but winning at being you. And the way to win is to figure out who you are and do your best.” He was absolutely right. I had no reason to oppose my friend. Instead, I should focus on myself and my own improvement. I breathed out slowly. My hands were steady now. At last, my mind was at peace.",
		"It was Evelyn’s first time to explore the Badlands of Alberta, famous across Canada for its numerous dinosaur fossils. As a young amateur bone-hunter, she was overflowing with anticipation. She had not travelled this far for the bones of common dinosaur species. Her life-long dream to find rare fossils of dinosaurs was about to come true. She began eagerly searching for them. After many hours of wandering throughout the deserted lands, however, she was unsuccessful. Now, the sun was beginning to set, and her goal was still far beyond her reach. Looking at the slowly darkening ground before her, she sighed to herself, “I can’t believe I came all this way for nothing. What a waste of time!”",
		"Putting all of her energy into her last steps of the running race, Jamie crossed the finish line. To her disappointment, she had failed to beat her personal best time, again. Jamie had pushed herself for months to finally break her record, but it was all for nothing. Recognizing how she felt about her failure, Ken, her teammate, approached her and said, “Jamie, even though you didn’t set a personal best time today, your performances have improved dramatically. Your running skills have progressed so much! You’ll definitely break your personal best time in the next race!” After hearing his comments, she felt confident about herself. Jamie, now motivated to keep pushing for her goal, replied with a smile. “You’re right! Next race, I’ll beat my best time for sure!”",
		"David was starting a new job in Vancouver, and he was waiting for his bus. He kept looking back and forth between his watch and the direction the bus would come from. He thought, “My bus isn’t here yet. I can’t be late on my first day.” David couldn’t feel at ease. When he looked up again, he saw a different bus coming that was going right to his work. The bus stopped in front of him and opened its door. He got on the bus thinking, “Phew! Luckily, this bus came just in time so I won’t be late.” He leaned back on an unoccupied seat in the bus and took a deep breath, finally able to relax.",
		"Many companies confuse activities and results. As a consequence, they make the mistake of designing a process that sets out milestones in the form of activities that must be carried out during the sales cycle. Salespeople have a genius for doing what’s compensated rather than what’s effective. If your process has an activity such as “submit proposal” or “make cold call,” then that’s just what your people will do. No matter that the calls were to the wrong customer or went nowhere. No matter that the proposal wasn’t submitted at the right point in the buying decision or contained inappropriate information. The process asked for activity, and activity was what it got. Salespeople have done what was asked for. “Garbage in, garbage out” they will delight in telling you. “It’s not our problem, it’s this dumb process.”",
		"Technology has doubtful advantages. We must balance too much information versus using only the right information and keeping the decision­making process simple. The Internet has made so much free information available on any issue that we think we have to consider all of it in order to make a decision. So we keep searching for answers on the Internet. This makes us information blinded, like deer in headlights, when trying to make personal, business, or other decisions. To be successful in anything today, we have to keep in mind that in the land of the blind, a one­eyed person can accomplish the seemingly impossible. The one­eyed person understands the power of keeping any analysis simple and will be the decision maker when he uses his one eye of intuition.",
		"For almost all things in life, there can be too much of a good thing. Even the best things in life aren’t so great in excess. This concept has been discussed at least as far back as Aristotle. He argued that being virtuous means finding a balance. For example, people should be brave, but if someone is too brave they become reckless. People should be trusting, but if someone is too trusting they are considered gullible. For each of these traits, it is best to avoid both deficiency and excess. The best way is to live at the “sweet spot” that maximizes well­being. Aristotle’s suggestion is that virtue is the midpoint, where someone is neither too generous nor too stingy, neither too afraid nor recklessly brave.",
		"I believe the second decade of this new century is already very different. There are, of course, still millions of people who equate success with money and power―who are determined to never get off that treadmill despite the cost in terms of their well­being, relationships, and happiness. There are still millions desperately looking for the next promotion, the next million­dollar payday that they believe will satisfy their longing to feel better about themselves, or silence their dissatisfaction. But both in the West and in emerging economies, there are more people every day who recognize that these are all dead ends―that they are chasing a broken dream. That we cannot find the answer in our current definition of success alone because―as Gertrude Stein once said of Oakland―“There is no there there.”",
		"There is a critical factor that determines whether your choice will influence that of others: the visible consequences of the choice. Take the case of the Adélie penguins. They are often found strolling in large groups toward the edge of the water in search of food. Yet danger awaits in the icy-cold water. There is the leopard seal, for one, which likes to have penguins for a meal. What is an Adélie to do? The penguins’ solution is to play the waiting game. They wait and wait and wait by the edge of the water until one of them gives up and jumps in. The moment that occurs, the rest of the penguins watch with anticipation to see what happens next. If the pioneer survives, everyone else will follow suit. If it perishes, they’ll turn away. One penguin’s destiny alters the fate of all the others. Their strategy, you could say, is “learn and live.”",
		"We all know that tempers are one of the first things lost in many arguments. It’s easy to say one should keep cool, but how do you do it? The point to remember is that sometimes in arguments the other person is trying to get you to be angry. They may be saying things that are intentionally designed to annoy you. They know that if they get you to lose your cool you’ll say something that sounds foolish; you’ll simply get angry and then it will be impossible for you to win the argument. So don’t fall for it. A remark may be made to cause your anger, but responding with a cool answer that focuses on the issue raised is likely to be most effective. Indeed, any attentive listener will admire the fact that you didn’t “rise to the bait.”",
		"There are more than 700 million cell phones used in the US today and at least 140 million of those cell phone users will abandon their current phone for a new phone every 14-18 months. I’m not one of those people who just “must” have the latest phone. Actually, I use my cell phone until the battery no longer holds a good charge. At that point, it’s time. So I figure I’ll just get a replacement battery. But I’m told that battery is no longer made and the phone is no longer manufactured because there’s newer technology and better features in the latest phones. That’s a typical justification. The phone wasn’t even that old; maybe a little over one year? I’m just one example. Can you imagine how many countless other people have that same scenario? No wonder cell phones take the lead when it comes to “e­waste.”",
		"With the Internet, everything changed. Product problems, overpromises, the lack of customer support, differential pricing ―all of the issues that customers actually experienced from a marketing organization suddenly popped out of the box. No longer were there any controlled communications or even business systems. Consumers could generally learn through the Web whatever they wanted to know about a company, its products, its competitors, its distribution systems, and, most of all, its truthfulness when talking about its products and services. Just as important, the Internet opened up a forum for customers to compare products, experiences, and values with other customers easily and quickly. Now the customer had a way to talk back to the marketer and to do so through public forums instantly.",
		"Get past the ‘I wish I hadn’t done that!’ reaction. If the disappointment you’re feeling is linked to an exam you didn’t pass because you didn’t study for it, or a job you didn’t get because you said silly things at the interview, or a person you didn’t impress because you took entirely the wrong approach, accept that it’s happened now. The only value of ‘I wish I hadn’t done that!’ is that you’ll know better what to do next time. The learning pay­off is useful and significant. This ‘if only I ......’ agenda is virtual. Once you have worked that out, it’s time to translate it from the past tense to the future tense: ‘Next time I’m in this situation, I’m going to try to ......’.",
		"We have a tendency to interpret events selectively. If we want things to be “this way” or “that way” we can most certainly select, stack, or arrange evidence in a way that supports such a viewpoint. Selective perception is based on what seems to us to stand out. However, what seems to us to be standing out may very well be related to our goals, interests, expectations, past experiences, or current demands of the situation—“with a hammer in hand, everything looks like a nail.” This quote highlights the phenomenon of selective perception. If we want to use a hammer, then the world around us may begin to look as though it is full of nails!",
		"Nothing is trash by nature. Anthropologist Mary Douglas brings back and analyzes the common saying that dirt is “matter out of place.” Dirt is relative, she emphasizes. “Shoes are not dirty in themselves, but it is dirty to place them on the dining­table; food is not dirty in itself, but it is dirty to leave pots and pans in the bedroom, or food all over clothing; similarly, bathroom items in the living room; clothing lying on chairs; outdoor things placed indoors; upstairs things downstairs, and so on.” Sorting the dirty from the clean―removing the shoes from the table, putting the dirty clothing in the washing machine―involves systematic ordering and classifying. Eliminating dirt is thus a positive process.",
		"When it comes to climate change, many blame the fossil fuel industry for pumping greenhouse gases, the agricultural sector for burning rainforests, or the fashion industry for producing excessive clothes. But wait, what drives these industrial activities? Our consumption. Climate change is a summed product of each person’s behavior. For example, the fossil fuel industry is a popular scapegoat in the climate crisis. But why do they drill and burn fossil fuels? We provide them strong financial incentives: some people regularly travel on airplanes and cars that burn fossil fuels. Some people waste electricity generated by burning fuel in power plants. Some people use and throw away plastic products derived from crude oil every day. Blaming the fossil fuel industry while engaging in these behaviors is a slap in our own face.",
		"A job search is not a passive task. When you are searching, you are not browsing, nor are you “just looking”. Browsing is not an effective way to reach a goal you claim to want to reach. If you are acting with purpose, if you are serious about anything you chose to do, then you need to be direct, focused and whenever possible, clever. Everyone else searching for a job has the same goal, competing for the same jobs. You must do more than the rest of the herd. Regardless of how long it may take you to find and get the job you want, being proactive will logically get you results faster than if you rely only on browsing online job boards and emailing an occasional resume. Leave those activities to the rest of the sheep.",
		"A psychology professor raised a glass of water while teaching stress management principles to her students, and asked them, “How heavy is this glass of water I’m holding?” Students shouted out various answers. The professor replied, “The absolute weight of this glass doesn’t matter. It depends on how long I hold it. If I hold it for a minute, it’s quite light. But, if I hold it for a day straight, it will cause severe pain in my arm, forcing me to drop the glass to the floor. In each case, the weight of the glass is the same, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it feels to me.” As the class nodded their heads in agreement, she continued, “Your stresses in life are like this glass of water. If you still feel the weight of yesterday’s stress, it’s a strong sign that it’s time to put the glass down.”",
		"Is the customer always right? When customers return a broken product to a famous company, which makes kitchen and bathroom fixtures, the company nearly always offers a replacement to maintain good customer relations. Still, “there are times you’ve got to say ‘no,’” explains the warranty expert of the company, such as when a product is undamaged or has been abused. Entrepreneur Lauren Thorp, who owns an e­commerce company, says, “While the customer is ‘always’ right, sometimes you just have to fire a customer.” When Thorp has tried everything to resolve a complaint and realizes that the customer will be dissatisfied no matter what, she returns her attention to the rest of her customers, who she says are “the reason for my success.”",
		"Our language helps to reveal our deeper assumptions. Think of these revealing phrases: When we accomplish something important, we say it took “blood, sweat, and tears.” We say important achievements are “hard-earned.” We recommend a “hard day’s work” when “day’s work” would be enough. When we talk of “easy money,” we are implying it was obtained through illegal or questionable means. We use the phrase “That’s easy for you to say” as a criticism, usually when we are seeking to invalidate someone’s opinion. It’s like we all automatically accept that the “right” way is, inevitably, the harder one. In my experience this is hardly ever questioned. What would happen if you do challenge this sacred cow? We don’t even pause to consider that something important and valuable could be made easy. What if the biggest thing keeping us from doing what matters is the false assumption that it has to take huge effort?",
		"Why do you care how a customer reacts to a purchase? Good question. By understanding post­purchase behavior, you can understand the influence and the likelihood of whether a buyer will repurchase the product (and whether she will keep it or return it). You’ll also determine whether the buyer will encourage others to purchase the product from you. Satisfied customers can become unpaid ambassadors for your business, so customer satisfaction should be on the top of your to­do list. People tend to believe the opinions of people they know. People trust friends over advertisements any day. They know that advertisements are paid to tell the “good side” and that they’re used to persuade them to purchase products and services. By continually monitoring your customer’s satisfaction after the sale, you have the ability to avoid negative word­of­mouth advertising.",
		"Most people have no doubt heard this question: If a tree falls in the forest and there is no one there to hear it fall, does it make a sound? The correct answer is no. Sound is more than pressure waves, and indeed there can be no sound without a hearer. And similarly, scientific communication is a two­way process. Just as a signal of any kind is useless unless it is perceived, a published scientific paper (signal) is useless unless it is both received and understood by its intended audience. Thus we can restate the axiom of science as follows: A scientific experiment is not complete until the results have been published and understood. Publication is no more than pressure waves unless the published paper is understood. Too many scientific papers fall silently in the woods.",
		"Many people take the commonsense view that color is an objective property of things, or of the light that bounces off them. They say a tree’s leaves are green because they reflect green light―a greenness that is just as real as the leaves. Others argue that color doesn’t inhabit the physical world at all but exists only in the eye or mind of the viewer. They maintain that if a tree fell in a forest and no one was there to see it, its leaves would be colorless―and so would everything else. They say there is no such thing as color; there are only the people who see it. Both positions are, in a way, correct. Color is objective and subjective―“the place,” as Paul Cézanne put it, “where our brain and the universe meet.” Color is created when light from the world is registered by the eyes and interpreted by the brain.",
		"Consider the seemingly simple question How many senses are there? Around 2,370 years ago, Aristotle wrote that there are five, in both humans and animals—sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. However, according to the philosopher Fiona Macpherson, there are reasons to doubt it. For a start, Aristotle missed a few in humans: the perception of your own body which is different from touch and the sense of balance which has links to both touch and vision. Other animals have senses that are even harder to categorize. Many vertebrates have a different sense system for detecting odors. Some snakes can detect the body heat of their prey. These examples tell us that “senses cannot be clearly divided into a limited number of specific kinds,” Macpherson wrote in The Senses. Instead of trying to push animal senses into Aristotelian buckets, we should study them for what they are.",
		"You can be perfect, but you need to change the way you think about it. Perfection actually is possible if you delete “perfect” and insert “complete.” Imagine a basketball player taking a fifteen­foot shot and the ball going through the net, never touching the rim. Someone is likely to exclaim, “That was a perfect shot!” And it was perfect. The scoreboard reflects an increase of two points. Now again imagine that same player a few minutes later taking another fifteen­foot shot. But this time the ball hits one side of the rim, rolls around and stands still for half a second, and it finally falls through the net. An announcer might comment on what an ugly shot that was, and she would be right. But basketball games are not won on such criteria as pretty or ugly. In this instance the ball went through the net and the scoreboard increased by two points. In that sense, the second shot was as perfect as the first.",
		"Humans are omnivorous, meaning that they can consume and digest a wide selection of plants and animals found in their surroundings. The primary advantage to this is that they can adapt to nearly all earthly environments. The disadvantage is that no single food provides the nutrition necessary for survival. Humans must be flexible enough to eat a variety of items sufficient for physical growth and maintenance, yet cautious enough not to randomly ingest foods that are physiologically harmful and, possibly, fatal. This dilemma, the need to experiment combined with the need for conservatism, is known as the omnivore’s paradox. It results in two contradictory psychological impulses regarding diet. The first is an attraction to new foods; the second is a preference for familiar foods.",
		"Crowdfunding is a new and more collaborative way to secure funding for projects. It can be used in different ways such as requesting donations for a worthy cause anywhere in the world and generating funding for a project with the contributors then becoming partners in the project. In essence, crowdfunding is the fusion of social networking and venture capitalism. In just the same way as social networks have rewritten the conventional rules about how people communicate and interact with each other, crowdfunding in all its variations has the potential to rewrite the rules on how businesses and other projects get funded in the future. Crowdfunding can be viewed as the democratization of business financing. Instead of restricting capital sourcing and allocation to a relatively small and fixed minority, crowdfunding empowers everyone connected to the Internet to access both the collective wisdom and the pocket money of everyone else who connects to the Internet.",
		"On one occasion I was trying to explain the concept of buffers to my children. We were in the car together at the time and I tried to explain the idea using a game. Imagine, I said, that we had to get to our destination three miles away without stopping. We couldn’t predict what was going to happen in front of us and around us. We didn’t know how long the light would stay on green or if the car in front would suddenly put on its brakes. The only way to keep from crashing was to put extra space between our car and the car in front of us. This space acts as a buffer. It gives us time to respond and adapt to any sudden moves by other cars. Similarly, we can reduce the friction of doing the essential in our work and lives simply by creating a buffer.",
		"Over the centuries various writers and thinkers, looking at humans from an outside perspective, have been struck by the theatrical quality of social life. The most famous quote expressing this comes from Shakespeare: “All the world’s a stage, / And all the men and women merely players; / They have their exits and their entrances, / And one man in his time plays many parts.” If the theater and actors were traditionally represented by the image of masks, writers such as Shakespeare are implying that all of us are constantly wearing masks. Some people are better actors than others. Evil types such as Iago in the play Othello are able to conceal their hostile intentions behind a friendly smile. Others are able to act with more confidence and bravado—they often become leaders. People with excellent acting skills can better navigate our complex social environments and get ahead.",
		"If creators knew when they were on their way to fashioning a masterpiece, their work would progress only forward: they would halt their idea­generation efforts as they struck gold. But in fact, they backtrack, returning to versions that they had earlier discarded as inadequate. In Beethoven’s most celebrated work, the Fifth Symphony, he scrapped the conclusion of the first movement because it felt too short, only to come back to it later. Had Beethoven been able to distinguish an extraordinary from an ordinary work, he would have accepted his composition immediately as a hit. When Picasso was painting his famous Guernica in protest of fascism, he produced 79 different drawings. Many of the images in the painting were based on his early sketches, not the later variations. If Picasso could judge his creations as he produced them, he would get consistently “warmer” and use the later drawings. But in reality, it was just as common that he got “colder.”",
		"In school, there’s one curriculum, one right way to study science, and one right formula that spits out the correct answer on a standardized test. Textbooks with grand titles like The Principles of Physics magically reveal “the principles” in three hundred pages. An authority figure then steps up to the lectern to feed us “the truth.” As theoretical physicist David Gross explained in his Nobel lecture, textbooks often ignore the many alternate paths that people wandered down, the many false clues they followed, the many misconceptions they had. We learn about Newton’s “laws”—as if they arrived by a grand divine visitation or a stroke of genius—but not the years he spent exploring, revising, and changing them. The laws that Newton failed to establish—most notably his experiments in alchemy, which attempted, and spectacularly failed, to turn lead into gold—don’t make the cut as part of the one-dimensional story told in physics classrooms. Instead, our education system turns the life stories of these scientists from lead to gold.",
		"The known fact of contingencies, without knowing precisely what those contingencies will be, shows that disaster preparation is not the same thing as disaster rehearsal. No matter how many mock disasters are staged according to prior plans, the real disaster will never mirror any one of them. Disaster­preparation planning is more like training for a marathon than training for a high­jump competition or a sprinting event. Marathon runners do not practice by running the full course of twenty­six miles; rather, they get into shape by running shorter distances and building up their endurance with cross­training. If they have prepared successfully, then they are in optimal condition to run the marathon over its predetermined course and length, assuming a range of weather conditions, predicted or not. This is normal marathon preparation.",
		"Author Elizabeth Gilbert tells the fable of a great saint who would lead his followers in meditation. Just as the followers were dropping into their zen moment, they would be disrupted by a cat that would walk through the temple meowing and bothering everyone. The saint came up with a simple solution: He began to tie the cat to a pole during meditation sessions. This solution quickly developed into a ritual: Tie the cat to the pole first, meditate second. When the cat eventually died of natural causes, a religious crisis followed. What were the followers supposed to do? How could they possibly meditate without tying the cat to the pole? This story illustrates what I call invisible rules. These are habits and behaviors that have unnecessarily rigidified into rules. Although written rules can be resistant to change, invisible ones are more stubborn. They’re the silent killers.",
		"The creative team exhibits paradoxical characteristics. It shows tendencies of thought and action that we’d assume to be mutually exclusive or contradictory. For example, to do its best work, a team needs deep knowledge of subjects relevant to the problem it’s trying to solve, and a mastery of the processes involved. But at the same time, the team needs fresh perspectives that are unencumbered by the prevailing wisdom or established ways of doing things. Often called a “beginner’s mind,” this is the newcomers’ perspective: people who are curious, even playful, and willing to ask anything—no matter how naive the question may seem—because they don’t know what they don’t know. Thus, bringing together contradictory characteristics can accelerate the process of new ideas.",
		"The most dangerous threat to our ability to concentrate is not that we use our smartphone during working hours, but that we use it too irregularly. By checking our emails every now and then on the computer and our text messages here and there on our phone with no particular schedule or rhythm in mind, our brain loses its ability to effectively filter. The solution is to regulate your devices as if you were on a strict diet. When it comes to nutrition, sticking to a fixed time plan for breakfast, lunch, and dinner allows your metabolism to adjust, thereby causing less hunger during the in-between phases. Your belly will start to rumble around 12:30 p.m. each day, but that’s okay because that’s a good time to eat lunch. If something unexpected happens, you can add a snack every now and then to get fresh energy, but your metabolism will remain under control. It’s the same with our brain when you put it on a “media diet.”",
		"For companies interested in delighting customers, exceptional value and service become part of the overall company culture. For example, year after year, Pazano ranks at or near the top of the hospitality industry in terms of customer satisfaction. The company’s passion for satisfying customers is summed up in its credo, which promises that its luxury hotels will deliver a truly memorable experience. Although a customer­centered firm seeks to deliver high customer satisfaction relative to competitors, it does not attempt to maximize customer satisfaction. A company can always increase customer satisfaction by lowering its price or increasing its services. But this may result in lower profits. Thus, the purpose of marketing is to generate customer value profitably. This requires a very delicate balance: the marketer must continue to generate more customer value and satisfaction but not ‘give away the house’.",
		"Perhaps worse than attempting to get the bad news out of the way is attempting to soften it or simply not address it at all. This “Mum Effect”—a term coined by psychologists Sidney Rosen and Abraham Tesser in the early 1970s— happens because people want to avoid becoming the target of others’ negative emotions. We all have the opportunity to lead change, yet it often requires of us the courage to deliver bad news to our superiors. We don’t want to be the innocent messenger who falls before a firing line. When our survival instincts kick in, they can override our courage until the truth of a situation gets watered down. “The Mum Effect and the resulting filtering can have devastating effects in a steep hierarchy,” writes Robert Sutton, an organizational psychologist. “What starts out as bad news becomes happier and happier as it travels up the ranks― because after each boss hears the news from his or her subordinates, he or she makes it sound a bit less bad before passing it up the chain.”",
		"Research in the science of peak performance and motivation points to the fact that different tasks should ideally be matched to our energy level. For example, analytical tasks are best accomplished when our energy is high and we are free from distractions and able to focus. I generally wake up energized. Over the years, I have consistently stuck to the habit of “eating my problems for breakfast.” I’m someone who tends to overthink different scenarios and conversations that haven’t happened yet. When I procrastinate on talking with an unhappy client or dealing with an unpleasant email, I find I waste too much emotional energy during the day. It’s as if the task hangs over my head, and I’ll spend more time worrying about it, talking about it, and avoiding it, than it would actually take to just take care of it. So for me, it’ll always be the first thing I get done. If you know you are not a morning person, be strategic about scheduling your difficult work later in the day.",
		"I suspect fungi are a little more forward “thinking” than their larger partners. Among trees, each species fights other species. Let’s assume the beeches native to Central Europe could emerge victorious in most forests there. Would this really be an advantage? What would happen if a new pathogen came along that infected most of the beeches and killed them? In that case, wouldn’t it be more advantageous if there were a certain number of other species around― oaks, maples, or firs―that would continue to grow and provide the shade needed for a new generation of young beeches to sprout and grow up? Diversity provides security for ancient forests. Because fungi are also very dependent on stable conditions, they support other species underground and protect them from complete collapse to ensure that one species of tree doesn’t manage to dominate.",
		"The arts and aesthetics offer emotional connection to the full range of human experience. “The arts can be more than just sugar on the tongue,” Anjan Chatterjee, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, says. “In art, when there’s something challenging, which can also be uncomfortable, this discomfort, if we’re willing to engage with it, offers the possibility of some change, some transformation. That can also be a powerful aesthetic experience.” The arts, in this way, become vehicles to contend with ideas and concepts that are difficult and uncomfortable otherwise. When Picasso painted his masterpiece Guernica in 1937, he captured the heartbreaking and cruel nature of war, and offered the world a way to consider the universal suffering caused by the Spanish Civil War. When Lorraine Hansberry wrote her play A Raisin in the Sun, she gave us a powerful story of people struggling with racism, discrimination, and the pursuit of the American dream while also offering a touching portrait of family life.",
		"If you had wanted to create a “self­-driving” car in the 1950s, your best option might have been to strap a brick to the accelerator. Yes, the vehicle would have been able to move forward on its own, but it could not slow down, stop, or turn to avoid barriers. Obviously not ideal. But does that mean the entire concept of the self­driving car is not worth pursuing? No, it only means that at the time we did not yet have the tools we now possess to help enable vehicles to operate both autonomously and safely. This once­distant dream now seems within our reach. It is much the same story in medicine. Two decades ago, we were still taping bricks to accelerators. Today, we are approaching the point where we can begin to bring some appropriate technology to bear in ways that advance our understanding of patients as unique individuals. In fact, many patients are already wearing devices that monitor their conditions in real time, which allows doctors to talk to their patients in a specific, refined, and feedback­driven way that was not even possible a decade ago.",
		"Here’s an interesting thought. If glaciers started re-forming, they have a great deal more water now to draw on―Hudson Bay, the Great Lakes, the hundreds of thousands of lakes of Canada, none of which existed to fuel the last ice sheet―so they would grow very much quicker. And if they did start to advance again, what exactly would we do? Blast them with TNT or maybe nuclear missiles? Well, doubtless we would, but consider this. In 1964, the largest earthquake ever recorded in North America rocked Alaska with 200,000 megatons of concentrated might, the equivalent of 2,000 nuclear bombs. Almost 3,000 miles away in Texas, water sloshed out of swimming pools. A street in Anchorage fell twenty feet. The quake devastated 24,000 square miles of wilderness, much of it glaciated. And what effect did all this might have on Alaska’s glaciers? None.",
		"Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi suggests that the common idea of a creative individual coming up with great insights, discoveries, works, or inventions in isolation is wrong. Creativity results from a complex interaction between a person and his or her environment or culture, and also depends on timing. For instance, if the great Renaissance artists like Ghiberti or Michelangelo had been born only 50 years before they were, the culture of artistic patronage would not have been in place to fund or shape their great achievements. Consider also individual astronomers: Their discoveries could not have happened unless centuries of technological development of the telescope and evolving knowledge of the universe had come before them. Csikszentmihalyi’s point is that we should devote as much attention to the development of a domain as we do to the people working within it, as only this can properly explain how advances are made. Individuals are only “a link in a chain, a phase in a process,” he notes.",
		"On August 12, 1994, major league baseball players went on strike, bringing baseball to a halt for the rest of the season. The strike, which lasted 235 days, ended in April of the next year when a federal judge issued an injunction against the club owners. Just before the strike, baseball was enjoying one of the most exciting seasons in many years. The lowly Montreal Expos were leading their league by six games, Tony Gwynn was enjoying a .400 batting average, and a number of ballplayers were having banner years. Just before the strike, the famed hitter Ken Griffey, Jr., was asked what he thought about the upcoming strike, especially since he and so many other ballplayers were doing so well. He replied: We picked a bad year to have a good year.",
		"Even though the first successful appendectomy was said to have been performed by a British army surgeon in 1735, it wasn’t until the 1880s that the procedure was described in medical journals and taught in medical schools. It was a welcome solution to an age­old disease and, by the turn of the century, was becoming so popular that many surgeons in Europe and America made a reasonable amount of money. Shortly before he died in 1902, the German physician­turned­ politician Rudolf Virchow was asked, “Is it true that a human being can survive without an appendix?” Even though he had not practiced medicine for many years, Virchow stayed in touch with developments in the field. Aware of the increasing popularity of the procedure, he wittily remarked: Human beings, yes, but not surgeons.",
		"Many writers make the common mistake of being too vague when picturing a reader. When it comes to identifying a target audience, everyone is no one. You may worry about excluding other people if you write specifically for one individual. Relax ―that doesn’t necessarily happen. A well-defined audience simplifies decisions about explanations and word choice. Your style may become more distinctive, in a way that attracts people beyond the target reader. For example, Andy Weir wrote The Martian for science fiction readers who want their stories firmly grounded in scientific fact, and perhaps rocket scientists who enjoy science fiction. I belong to neither audience, yet I enjoyed the book. Weir was so successful at pleasing his target audience that they shared it widely and enthusiastically. Because Weir didn’t try to cater to everyone, he wrote something that delighted his core audience. Eventually, his work traveled far beyond that sphere. It may be counterintuitive, but if you want to broaden your impact, tighten your focus on the reader.",
		"Think of the world as a premature baby in an incubator. The baby’s health status is extremely bad and her breathing, heart rate, and other important signs are tracked constantly so that changes for better or worse can quickly be seen. After a week, she is getting a lot better. On all the main measures, she is improving, but she still has to stay in the incubator because her health is still critical. Does it make sense to say that the infant’s situation is improving? Yes. Absolutely. Does it make sense to say it is bad? Yes. Absolutely. Does saying “things are improving” imply that everything is fine, and we should all relax and not worry? No, not at all. Is it helpful to have to choose between bad and improving? Definitely not. It’s both. That is how we must think about the current state of the world.",
		"For a long time, tourism was seen as a huge monster invading the areas of indigenous peoples, introducing them to the evils of the modern world. However, research has shown that this is not the correct way to perceive it. In most places, tourists are welcome and indigenous people see tourism as a path to modernity and economic development. But such development is always a two-edged sword. Tourism can mean progress, but most often also means the loss of traditions and cultural uniqueness. And, of course, there are examples of ‘cultural pollution’, ‘vulgarization’ and ‘phony-folk-cultures’. The background for such characteristics is often more or less romantic and the normative ideas of a former or prevailing authenticity. Ideally (to some) there should exist ancient cultures for modern consumers to gaze at, or even step into for a while, while travelling or on holiday. This is a cage model that is difficult to defend in a global world where we all, indigenous or not, are part of the same social fabric.",
		"Most people who try to slow down put the proverbial cart before the horse. They make dramatic, often costly changes in their lifestyle, only to encounter two disappointing results. First, they don’t enjoy the changes they make. People who are temperamentally used to a fast­paced life quickly discover that a slower­paced life in the country all but drives them crazy. Their habitual, hectic thinking won’t allow them to adjust the superficial changes they make. Second, lifestyle changes alone rarely make a real difference. You can rearrange the externals of your life in a radically different way, but you always take your thinking with you. If you are a hurried, rushed person in the city, you’ll also be a hurried, rushed person in the country. To mend the problem, you should slow down your life from the inside out.",
		"What happens when students get the message that saying the wrong thing can get you in trouble? They do what one would expect: they talk to people they already agree with, keep their mouths shut about important topics in mixed company, and often don’t bother even arguing with the angriest or loudest person in the room. The result is a group polarization that follows graduates into the real world. As the sociologist Diana C. Mutz discovered in her book Hearing the Other Side, those with the highest levels of education have the lowest exposure to people with conflicting points of view, while those who have not graduated from high school can claim the most diverse discussion mates. In other words, those most likely to live in the tightest echo chambers are those with the highest level of education. It should be the opposite, shouldn’t it? A good education ought to teach citizens to actively seek out the opinions of intelligent people with whom they disagree, in order to prevent the problem of “confirmation bias.”",
		"Many ancillary businesses that today seem almost core at one time started out as journey edges. For example, retailers often boost sales with accompanying support such as assembly or installation services. Think of a home goods retailer selling an unassembled outdoor grill as a box of parts and leaving its customer’s mission incomplete. When that retailer also sells assembly and delivery, it takes another step in the journey to the customer’s true mission of cooking in his backyard. Another example is the business-to-business service contracts that are layered on top of software sales. Maintenance, installation, training, delivery, anything at all that turns do-it-yourself into a do-it-for-me solution originally resulted from exploring the edge of where core products intersect with customer journeys.",
		"In recent years I’ve come to see that, amazingly, the key to almost all of our problems is faulty storytelling, because it’s storytelling that drives the way we gather and spend our energy. I believe that stories―not the ones people tell us but the ones we tell ourselves―determine nothing less than our personal and professional destinies. And the most important story you will ever tell about yourself is the story you tell to yourself. So, you’d better examine your story, especially this one that’s supposedly the most familiar of all. “The most erroneous stories are those we think we know best―and therefore never scrutinize or question,” said paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould. Participate in your story rather than observing it from afar; make sure it’s a story that compels you. Tell yourself the right story―the rightness of which only you can really determine. If you’re finally living the story you want, then it needn’t―it shouldn’t and won’t― be an ordinary one. It can and will be extraordinary. After all, you’re not just the author of your story but also its main character, the hero. Heroes are never ordinary.",
		"By expecting what’s likely to happen next, you prepare for the few most likely scenarios so that you don’t have to figure things out while they’re happening. It’s therefore not a surprise when a restaurant server offers you a menu. When she brings you a glass with a clear fluid in it, you don’t have to ask if it’s water. After you eat, you don’t have to figure out why you aren’t hungry anymore. All these things are expected and are therefore not problems to solve. Furthermore, imagine how demanding it would be to always consider all the possible uses for all the familiar objects with which you interact. Should I use my hammer or my telephone to pound in that nail? On a daily basis, functional fixedness is a relief, not a curse. That’s why you shouldn’t even attempt to consider all your options and possibilities. You can’t. If you tried to, then you’d never get anything done. So don’t knock the box. Ironically, although it limits your thinking, it also makes you smart. It helps you to stay one step ahead of reality.",
		"Under­slept employees are not going to drive your business forward with productive innovation. Like a group of people riding stationary exercise bikes, everyone looks like they are pedaling, but the scenery never changes. The irony that employees miss is that when you are not getting enough sleep, you work less productively and thus need to work longer to accomplish a goal. This means you often must work longer and later into the evening, arrive home later, go to bed later, and need to wake up earlier, creating a negative feedback loop. Why try to boil a pot of water on medium heat when you could do so in half the time on high? People often tell me that they do not have enough time to sleep because they have so much work to do. Without wanting to be combative in any way whatsoever, I respond by informing them that perhaps the reason they still have so much to do at the end of the day is precisely because they do not get enough sleep at night.",
		"While user habits are a boon to companies fortunate enough to generate them, their existence inherently makes success less likely for new innovations and startups trying to disrupt the status quo. The fact is, successfully changing long­term user habits is exceptionally rare. Altering behavior requires not only an understanding of how to persuade people to act but also necessitates getting them to repeat behaviors for long periods, ideally for the rest of their lives. Companies that succeed in building a habit­forming business are often associated with game­changing, wildly successful innovation. But like any discipline, habit design has rules that define and explain why some products change lives while others do not. For one, new behaviors have a short half­life, as our minds tend to return to our old ways of thinking and doing. Experiments show that lab animals habituated to new behaviors tend to regress to their first learned behaviors over time. To borrow a term from accounting, behaviors are LIFO─“last in, first out.”",
		"All any neuron in the brain ever “sees” is that some change occurred in the firing patterns of its upstream peers. It cannot tell whether such change is caused by an external disturbance or by the brain’s constant self-organized activity. Thus, neurons located in networks of other neurons do not “know” what the brain’s sensors are sensing; they simply respond to their upstream inputs. In other words, the neurons have no way of relating or comparing their spikes to anything else because they only receive retinal correspondences or processed “representations” of the sensory input. But establishing correspondences without knowing the rules by which those correspondences are constructed is like comparing Mansi words with Khanty words when we understand neither language. Only after we have defined the vocabulary of one language can we understand the corresponding meaning of words in the other. Similarly, without further information, sensory neurons can attach no meaning whatsoever to their spikes. Put simply, the mind’s eye is blind.",
		"The single most important change you can make in your working habits is to switch to creative work first, reactive work second. This means blocking off a large chunk of time every day for creative work on your own priorities, with the phone and e-mail off. I used to be a frustrated writer. Making this switch turned me into a productive writer. Yet there wasn’t a single day when I sat down to write an article, blog post, or book chapter without a string of people waiting for me to get back to them. It wasn’t easy, and it still isn’t, particularly when I get phone messages beginning “I sent you an e-mail two hours ago......!” By definition, this approach goes against the grain of others’ expectations and the pressures they put on you. It takes willpower to switch off the world, even for an hour. It feels uncomfortable, and sometimes people get upset. But it’s better to disappoint a few people over small things, than to abandon your dreams for an empty inbox. Otherwise, you’re sacrificing your potential for the illusion of professionalism.",
		"Perhaps the most puzzling aspect of innovation is how unpopular it is, for all the lip service we pay to it. Despite the abundant evidence that it has transformed almost everybody’s lives for the better in innumerable ways, the kneejerk reaction of most people to something new is often worry, sometimes even disgust. Unless it is of obvious use to ourselves, we tend to imagine the bad consequences that might occur far more than the good ones. And we throw obstacles in the way of innovators, on behalf of those with a vested interest in the status quo: investors, managers and employees alike. History shows that innovation is a delicate and vulnerable flower, easily crushed underfoot, but quick to regrow if conditions allow.",
		"Flicking the collaboration light switch is something that leaders are uniquely positioned to do, because several obstacles stand in the way of people voluntarily working alone. For one thing, the fear of being left out of the loop can keep them glued to their enterprise social media. Individuals don’t want to be―or appear to be―isolated. For another, knowing what their teammates are doing provides a sense of comfort and security, because people can adjust their own behavior to be in harmony with the group. It’s risky to go off on their own to try something new that will probably not be successful right from the start. But even though it feels reassuring for individuals to be hyperconnected, it’s better for the organization if they periodically go off and think for themselves and generate diverse―if not quite mature―ideas. Thus, it becomes the leader’s job to create conditions that are good for the whole by enforcing intermittent interaction even when people wouldn’t choose it for themselves, without making it seem like a punishment.",
		"Two independent research groups have discovered that we have “confusion at the frontier” when we search the Internet. Adrian Ward, a psychologist at the University of Texas, found that engaging in Internet searches increased people’s cognitive self­esteem, their sense of their own ability to remember and process information. Moreover, people who searched the Internet for facts they didn’t know and were later asked where they found the information often misremembered and reported that they had known it all along. Many of them completely forgot ever having conducted the search. They gave themselves the credit instead of the Internet. In a different set of studies, researchers found that those who had searched the Internet to answer specific questions rated their ability to answer unrelated questions as higher than those who had not. The act of searching the Internet and finding answers to one set of questions caused the participants to increase their sense that they knew the answers to all questions, including those whose answers they had not researched.",
		"Thomas Edison’s name is synonymous with invention, and his most famous invention, the electric light bulb, is a familiar symbol for that flash of inspired genius traditionally associated with the inventive act. Besides being the exemplar of the “bright idea,” however, Edison’s electric light is worthy of study for other reasons. The technical and economic importance of the light and of the electrical system that surrounded it matches that of any other invention we could name, at least from the last two hundred years. The introduction and spread of electric light and power was one of the key steps in the transformation of the world from an industrial age, characterized by iron and coal and steam, to a post‑industrial one, in which electricity was joined by petroleum, light metals and alloys, and internal combustion engines to give the twentieth century its distinctive form and character. Our own time still largely carries the stamp of this age, however dazzled we may be by the electronic, computerized, and media wonders of the twenty‑first century.",
		"Journalists love to report studies that are at the “initial findings” stages—research that claims to be the first time anyone has discovered a thing—because there is newsworthiness in their novelty. But “first ever” discoveries are extremely vulnerable to becoming undermined by subsequent research. When that happens, the news media often don’t go back and inform their audiences about the change—assuming they even hear about it. Kelly Crowe, a CBC News reporter writes, quoting one epidemiologist, “There is increasing concern that in modern research, false findings may be the majority or even the vast majority of published research claims.” She goes on to suggest that journalists, though blameworthy for this tendency, are aided and abetted by the scientists whose studies they cite. She writes that the “conclusions” sections in scientific abstracts can sometimes be overstated in an attempt to draw attention from prestigious academic journals and media who uncritically take their bait. Even so, Crowe ends her piece by stressing that there is still an incompatibility between the purposes and processes of news and science: Science ‘evolves,’ but news ‘happens.’",
		"Our view of the world is not given to us from the outside in a pure, objective form; it is shaped by our mental abilities, our shared cultural perspectives and our unique values and beliefs. This is not to say that there is no reality outside our minds or that the world is just an illusion. It is to say that our version of reality is precisely that: our version, not the version. There is no single, universal or authoritative version that makes sense, other than as a theoretical construct. We can see the world only as it appears to us, not “as it truly is,” because there is no “as it truly is” without a perspective to give it form. Philosopher Thomas Nagel argued that there is no “view from nowhere,” since we cannot see the world except from a particular perspective, and that perspective influences what we see. We can experience the world only through the human lenses that make it intelligible to us.",
		"It seemed like a fair deal: we would accept new technologies, which would modify our habits and oblige us to adjust to certain changes, but in exchange we would be granted relief from the burden of work, more security, and above all, the freedom to pursue our desires. The sacrifice was worth the gain; there would be no regrets. Yet it has become apparent that this civilization of leisure was, in reality, a Trojan horse. Its swelling flanks hid the impositions of a new type of enslavement. The automatons are not as autonomous as advertised. They need us. Those computers that were supposed to do our calculations for us instead demand our attention: for ten hours a day, we are glued to their screens. Our communications monopolize our time. Time itself is accelerating. The complexity of the system overwhelms us. And leisure is often a costly distraction.",
		"You may feel there is something scary about an algorithm deciding what you might like. Could it mean that, if computers conclude you won’t like something, you will never get the chance to see it? Personally, I really enjoy being directed toward new music that I might not have found by myself. I can quickly get stuck in a rut where I put on the same songs over and over. That’s why I’ve always enjoyed the radio. But the algorithms that are now pushing and pulling me through the music library are perfectly suited to finding gems that I’ll like. My worry originally about such algorithms was that they might drive everyone into certain parts of the library, leaving others lacking listeners. Would they cause a convergence of tastes? But thanks to the nonlinear and chaotic mathematics usually behind them, this doesn’t happen. A small divergence in my likes compared to yours can send us off into different far corners of the library.",
		"Our brains light up when our predicted reality and actual reality match. Our brains love to be right. We also don’t like to be wrong, and we feel threatened when our stereotyped predictions don’t come true. Psychologist Wendy Mendes asked White and Asian college students to interact with Latino students who had been hired as actors by the researchers. Some of the Latino students portrayed themselves as socioeconomically “high status,” with lawyer fathers, professor mothers, and summers spent volunteering in Europe. Others portrayed themselves as “low status,” with unemployed parents and part-time summer jobs. The researchers found that when participants interacted with the Latino students who appeared to come from wealth and thus challenged American stereotypes, they responded physiologically as if to a threat: their blood vessels constricted and their heart activity changed. In these interactions, participants also saw the students who violated stereotypes as less likable. In this way, stereotypes that are descriptive can easily become prescriptive. The phenomenon, it turns out, may have a neuroscientific explanation: it’s an angry protest from the brain’s reward system.",
		"Lawyers sometimes describe ownership as a bundle of sticks. This metaphor was introduced about a century ago, and it has dramatically transformed the teaching and practice of law. The metaphor is useful because it helps us see ownership as a grouping of interpersonal rights that can be separated and put back together. When you say It’s mine in reference to a resource, often that means you own a lot of the sticks that make up the full bundle: the sell stick, the rent stick, the right to mortgage, license, give away, even destroy the thing. Often, though, we split the sticks up, as for a piece of land: there may be a landowner, a bank with a mortgage, a tenant with a lease, a plumber with a license to enter the land, an oil company with mineral rights. Each of these parties owns a stick in the bundle.",
		"Humans already have a longer period of protected immaturity—a longer childhood—than any other species. Across species, a long childhood is correlated with an evolutionary strategy that depends on flexibility, intelligence, and learning. There is a developmental division of labor. Children get to learn freely about their particular environment without worrying about their own survival— caregivers look after that. Adults use what they learned as children to mate, hunt, and generally succeed as grown­ups in that environment. Children are the R&D (research and development) department of the human species. We grown­ups are production and marketing. We start out as brilliantly flexible but helpless and dependent babies, great at learning everything but terrible at doing just about anything. We end up as much less flexible but much more efficient and effective adults, not so good at learning but terrific at planning and acting.",
		"Gold plating in the project means needlessly enhancing the expected results, namely, adding characteristics that are costly, not required, and that have low added value with respect to the targets―in other words, giving more with no real justification other than to demonstrate one’s own talent. Gold plating is especially interesting for project team members, as it is typical of projects with a marked professional component―in other words, projects that involve specialists with proven experience and extensive professional autonomy. In these environments specialists often see the project as an opportunity to test and enrich their skill sets. There is therefore a strong temptation, in all good faith, to engage in gold plating, namely, to achieve more or higher-quality work that gratifies the professional but does not add value to the client’s requests, and at the same time removes valuable resources from the project. As the saying goes, “The best is the enemy of the good.”",
		"Physicians and other natural scientists test their theories using controlled experiments. Macroeconomists, however, have no laboratories and little ability to run economy­wide experiments of any kind. Granted, they can study different economies around the world, but each economy is unique, so comparisons are tricky. Controlled experiments also provide the natural sciences with something seldom available to economists—the chance, or serendipitous, discovery (such as penicillin). Macroeconomists studying the U.S. economy have only one patient, so they can’t introduce particular policies in a variety of alternative settings. You can’t squeeze economies into a test tube. Cries of “Eureka!” are seldom heard from macroeconomists. An economy consisting of hundreds of millions of individual actors is a complicated thing. As Nobel Prize­winning physicist Murray Gell­Mann once observed, “Think how hard physics would be if particles could think.”",
		"That perception is a construction is not true just of one’s perception of sensory input, such as visual and auditory information. It is true of your social perceptions as well― your perceptions of the people you meet, the food you eat, and even of the products you buy. For example, in a study of wine, when wines were tasted blind, there was little or no correlation between the ratings of a wine’s taste and its cost, but there was a significant correlation when the wines were labeled by price. That wasn’t because the subjects consciously believed that the higher­priced wines should be the better ones and thus revised whatever opinion they had accordingly. Or rather, it wasn’t true just at the conscious level. We know because as the subjects were tasting the wine, the researchers were imaging their brain activity, and the imaging showed that drinking what they believed was an expensive glass of wine really did activate their centers of taste for pleasure more than drinking a glass of the same wine that had been labeled as cheaper. That’s related to the placebo effect. Like pain, taste is not just the product of sensory signals; it depends also on psychological factors: you don’t just taste the wine; you taste its price.",
		"Although not the explicit goal, the best science can really be seen as refining ignorance. Scientists, especially young ones, can get too obsessed with results. Society helps them along in this mad chase. Big discoveries are covered in the press, show up on the university’s home page, help get grants, and make the case for promotions. But it’s wrong. Great scientists, the pioneers that we admire, are not concerned with results but with the next questions. The highly respected physicist Enrico Fermi told his students that an experiment that successfully proves a hypothesis is a measurement; one that doesn’t is a discovery. A discovery, an uncovering―of new ignorance. The Nobel Prize, the pinnacle of scientific accomplishment, is awarded, not for a lifetime of scientific achievement, but for a single discovery, a result. Even the Nobel committee realizes in some way that this is not really in the scientific spirit, and their award citations commonly honor the discovery for having “opened a field up,” “transformed a field,” or “taken a field in new and unexpected directions.”",
		"Any learning environment that deals with only the database instincts or only the improvisatory instincts ignores one half of our ability. It is bound to fail. It makes me think of jazz guitarists: They’re not going to make it if they know a lot about music theory but don’t know how to jam in a live concert. Some schools and workplaces emphasize a stable, rote-learned database. They ignore the improvisatory instincts drilled into us for millions of years. Creativity suffers. Others emphasize creative usage of a database, without installing a fund of knowledge in the first place. They ignore our need to obtain a deep understanding of a subject, which includes memorizing and storing a richly structured database. You get people who are great improvisers but don’t have depth of knowledge. You may know someone like this where you work. They may look like jazz musicians and have the appearance of jamming, but in the end they know nothing. They’re playing intellectual air guitar.",

		"Scientists have no special purchase on moral or ethical decisions; a climate scientist is no more qualified to comment on health care reform than a physicist is to judge the causes of bee colony collapse. The very features that create expertise in a specialized domain lead to ignorance in many others. In some cases lay people―farmers, fishermen, patients, native peoples― may have relevant experiences that scientists can learn from. Indeed, in recent years, scientists have begun to recognize this: the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment includes observations gathered from local native groups. So our trust needs to be limited, and focused. It needs to be very particular. Blind trust will get us into at least as much trouble as no trust at all. But without some degree of trust in our designated experts―the men and women who have devoted their lives to sorting out tough questions about the natural world we live in―we are paralyzed, in effect not knowing whether to make ready for the morning commute or not.",
		"Coming of age in the 18th and 19th centuries, the personal diary became a centerpiece in the construction of a modern subjectivity, at the heart of which is the application of reason and critique to the understanding of world and self, which allowed the creation of a new kind of knowledge. Diaries were central media through which enlightened and free subjects could be constructed. They provided a space where one could write daily about her whereabouts, feelings, and thoughts. Over time and with rereading, disparate entries, events, and happenstances could be rendered into insights and narratives about the self, and allowed for the formation of subjectivity. It is in that context that the idea of “the self [as] both made and explored with words” emerges. Diaries were personal and private; one would write for oneself, or, in Habermas’s formulation, one would make oneself public to oneself. By making the self public in a private sphere, the self also became an object for self-inspection and self-critique.",
		"How you focus your attention plays a critical role in how you deal with stress. Scattered attention harms your ability to let go of stress, because even though your attention is scattered, it is narrowly focused, for you are able to fixate only on the stressful parts of your experience. When your attentional spotlight is widened, you can more easily let go of stress. You can put in perspective many more aspects of any situation and not get locked into one part that ties you down to superficial and anxiety-provoking levels of attention. A narrow focus heightens the stress level of each experience, but a widened focus turns down the stress level because you’re better able to put each situation into a broader perspective. One anxiety-provoking detail is less important than the bigger picture. It’s like transforming yourself into a nonstick frying pan. You can still fry an egg, but the egg won’t stick to the pan.",
		"Study the lives of the great people who have made an impact on the world, and you will find that in virtually every case, they spent a considerable amount of time alone thinking. Every political leader who had an impact on history practiced the discipline of being alone to think and plan. Great artists spend countless hours in their studios or with their instruments not just doing, but exploring their ideas and experiences. Time alone allows people to sort through their experiences, put them into perspective, and plan for the future. I strongly encourage you to find a place to think and to discipline yourself to pause and use it because it has the potential to change your life. It can help you to figure out what’s really important and what isn’t.",
		"When you say “My car is broken,” that is not, in itself, a problem if you’ve got two cars. So a better statement would be, “I have no way to get to work today,” or “I’m going to be late getting to work today because my only car is broken.” The reason to clearly state the root problem is that your goal in this specific instance is not to “fix my car.” It is to get to work. Stating the problem in this way opens up other options: taking the bus, calling a friend, taking the day off, etc. A clear statement of the problem will help you come up with clear options of how to fix it.",
		"The initial stages of a relationship―courtship, marriage, honeymoon―are usually relatively conflict‒free. But then, while the couple is together, there is conflict. To many, conflict within a relationship means that the relationship itself is in trouble; perfect harmony―the absence of conflict―is considered the standard we should all strive for. As it turns out, conflict is not only unavoidable but actually crucial for the long‒term success of the relationship. Think of conflicts as a form of vaccine. When we immunize against a disease, we are in fact injecting a weakened strain of the disease into the body, which is then stimulated to develop the antibodies that enable it to deal with more major assaults later on. Likewise, minor conflicts help our relationship develop defense capabilities; they immunize the relationship and help partners deal with major gridlocks when they arise.",
		"One of the best things you can do to get support for your dream is to support somebody else’s first. When you run into a wall of resistance or indifference from friends and family members, stop asking, “How can I get them to be a fan of my dream?” Instead, ask, “How can I be a fan of their dream?” Tell your friend who doesn’t get what you’re trying to do, “I’ve explained my dream a few times, but never asked you, what’s yours?” If you want help for your dream, start by helping someone else with theirs. If you want support for your hope, start by giving support to someone else’s hope. Giving support is often the best way to get it.",
		"Problems can appear to be unsolvable. We are social animals who need to discuss our problems with others. When we are alone, problems become more serious. By sharing, we can get opinions and find solutions. An experiment was conducted with a group of women who had low satisfaction in life. Some of the women were introduced to others who were in similar situations, and some of the women were left on their own to deal with their concerns. Those who interacted with others reduced their concerns by 55 percent over time, but those who were left on their own showed no improvement.",
		"A number of studies have shown that the body weight and attitudes of a patient’s spouse can have a major impact on the amount of weight lost and on success in weight maintenance. Black & Threlfall found that overweight patients with normal-weight partners lost significantly more weight than those with overweight partners. They also noted that success was greater in those patients whose partners had also lost weight even though they were not included in the program, suggesting that recommended changes were being actively supported by the spouse. Similarly, Pratt found that drop-out rates were reduced when the patient’s spouse was included in a weight-control program.",
		"You’ve probably looked around you and noticed that all people are unique and different. Even people who might seem really similar in certain ways can also be very different. From different appearances, to different personalities, to different beliefs―it’s a big world full of interesting and diverse people! It is tolerance that protects the diversity which makes the world so exciting. Tolerance is the idea that all people should be equally accepted and equally treated, regardless of their differences from others. It’s a lot like fairness. Having tolerance means giving every person the same consideration, despite a person’s opinions, background, appearance, or other qualities, and whether or not those things are the same as your own. Tolerance allows the world to flourish. That is why treating other people with tolerance is very important.",
		"It is important to recognize your pet’s particular needs and respect them. If your pet is an athletic, high­energy dog, for example, he or she is going to be much more manageable indoors if you take him or her outside to chase a ball for an hour every day. If your cat is shy and timid, he or she won’t want to be dressed up and displayed in cat shows. Similarly, you cannot expect macaws to be quiet and still all the time―they are, by nature, loud and emotional creatures, and it is not their fault that your apartment doesn’t absorb sound as well as a rain forest.",
		"An interesting study about facial expressions was recently published by the American Psychological Association. Fifteen Chinese people and fifteen Scottish people took part in the study. They viewed emotion­neutral faces that were randomly changed on a computer screen and then categorized the facial expressions as happy, sad, surprised, fearful, or angry. The responses allowed researchers to identify the expressive facial features that participants associated with each emotion. The study found that the Chinese participants relied more on the eyes to tell facial expressions, while the Scottish participants relied on the eyebrows and mouth. People from different cultures perceive happy, sad, or angry facial expressions in different ways. That is, facial expressions are not the “universal language of emotions.”",
		"Although errors and biases will always occur in science, the peer review system and the open discussion of ideas and results can minimize their effects and lead the scientific community toward the truth. Thus, although scientists make many errors, science can be self­correcting. However, in order for the mechanism of peer review to work, it is important that scientists do not avoid this process. Research should be evaluated by other members of the scientific profession before it is applied or made public. There are many studies that contain errors because the researchers did not allow their work to be evaluated by peers before they published it.",
		"Imagine a tree. Let’s suppose this tree represents the tree of life. On this tree there are fruits. In life, our fruits are called our results. So we look at the fruits (our results) and we don’t like them; there aren’t enough of them, they’re too small, or they don’t taste good. So what do we tend to do? Most of us put even more attention and focus on the fruits, our results. But what is it that actually creates those particular fruits? It’s the seeds and the roots that create those fruits. It’s what’s under the ground that creates what’s above the ground. It’s what’s invisible that creates what’s visible. So what does that mean? It means that if you want to change the fruits, you will first have to change the roots. If you want to change the visible, you must first change the invisible.",
		"Recent studies show some interesting findings about habit formation. In these studies, students who successfully acquired one positive habit reported less stress; less impulsive spending; better dietary habits; decreased caffeine consumption; fewer hours spent watching TV; and even fewer dirty dishes. Keep working on one habit long enough, and not only does it become easier, but so do other things as well. It’s why those with the right habits seem to do better than others. They’re doing the most important thing regularly and, as a result, everything else is easier.",
		"If you walk into a room that smells of freshly baked bread, you quickly detect the rather pleasant smell. However, stay in the room for a few minutes, and the smell will seem to disappear. In fact, the only way to reawaken it is to walk out of the room and come back in again. The exact same concept applies to many areas of our lives, including happiness. Everyone has something to be happy about. Perhaps they have a loving partner, good health, a satisfying job, a roof over their heads, or enough food to eat. As time passes, however, they get used to what they have and, just like the smell of fresh bread, these wonderful assets disappear from their consciousness. As the old proverb goes, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.",
		"Experts advise people to “take the stairs instead of the elevator” or “walk or bike to work.” These are good strategies: climbing stairs provides a good workout, and people who walk or ride a bicycle for transportation most often meet their needs for physical activity. Many people, however, face barriers in their environment that prevent such choices. Few people would choose to walk or bike on roadways that lack safe sidewalks or marked bicycle lanes, where vehicles speed by, or where the air is polluted. Few would choose to walk up stairs in inconvenient and unsafe stairwells in modern buildings. In contrast, people living in neighborhoods with safe biking and walking lanes, public parks, and freely available exercise facilities use them often —their surroundings encourage physical activity.",
		"Too many companies advertise their new products as if their competitors did not exist. They advertise their products in a vacuum and are disappointed when their messages fail to get through. Introducing a new product category is difficult, especially if the new category is not contrasted against the old one. Consumers do not usually pay attention to what’s new and different unless it’s related to the old. That’s why if you have a truly new product, it’s often better to say what the product is not, rather than what it is. For example, the first automobile was called a “horseless” carriage, a name which allowed the public to understand the concept against the existing mode of transportation.",
		"It might seem that praising your child’s intelligence or talent would boost his self­esteem and motivate him. But it turns out that this sort of praise backfires. Carol Dweck and her colleagues have demonstrated the effect in a series of experimental studies: “When we praise kids for their ability, kids become more cautious. They avoid challenges.” It’s as if they are afraid to do anything that might make them fail and lose your high appraisal. Kids might also get the message that intelligence or talent is something that people either have or don’t have. This leaves kids feeling helpless when they make mistakes. What’s the point of trying to improve if your mistakes indicate that you lack intelligence?",
		"Imagine that your body is a battery and the more energy this battery can store, the more energy you will be able to have within a day. Every night when you sleep, this battery is recharged with as much energy as you spent during the previous day. If you want to have a lot of energy tomorrow, you need to spend a lot of energy today. Our brain consumes only 20% of our energy, so it’s a must to supplement thinking activities with walking and exercises that spend a lot of energy, so that your internal battery has more energy tomorrow. Your body stores as much energy as you need: for thinking, for moving, for doing exercises. The more active you are today, the more energy you spend today and the more energy you will have to burn tomorrow. Exercising gives you more energy and keeps you from feeling exhausted.",
		"According to professor Jacqueline Olds, there is one sure way for lonely patients to make a friend—to join a group that has a shared purpose. This may be difficult for people who are lonely, but research shows that it can help. Studies reveal that people who are engaged in service to others, such as volunteering, tend to be happier. Volunteers report a sense of satisfaction at enriching their social network in the service of others. Volunteering helps to reduce loneliness in two ways. First, someone who is lonely might benefit from helping others. Also, they might benefit from being involved in a voluntary program where they receive support and help to build their own social network.",
		"Certainly praise is critical to a child’s sense of self­esteem, but when given too often for too little, it kills the impact of real praise when it is called for. Everyone needs to know they are valued and appreciated, and praise is one way of expressing such feelings―but only after something praiseworthy has been accomplished. Awards are supposed to be rewards―reactions to positive actions, honors for doing something well!The ever­present danger in handing out such honors too lightly is that children may come to depend on them and do only those things that they know will result in prizes. If they are not sure they can do well enough to earn merit badges, or if gifts are not guaranteed, they may avoid certain activities.",
		"Attaining the life a person wants is simple. However, most people settle for less than their best because they fail to start the day off right. If a person starts the day with a positive mindset, that person is more likely to have a positive day. Moreover, how a person approaches the day impacts everything else in that person’s life. If a person begins their day in a good mood, they will likely continue to be happy at work and that will often lead to a more productive day in the office. This increased productivity unsurprisingly leads to better work rewards, such as promotions or raises. Consequently, if people want to live the life of their dreams, they need to realize that how they start their day not only impacts that day, but every aspect of their lives.",
		"How many of you have a hard time saying no? No matter what anyone asks of you, no matter how much of an inconvenience it poses for you, you do what they request. This is not a healthy way of living because by saying yes all the time you are building up emotions of inconvenience. You know what will happen in time? You will resent the person who you feel you cannot say no to because you no longer have control of your life and of what makes you happy. You are allowing someone else to have control over your life. When you are suppressed emotionally and constantly do things against your own will, your stress will eat you up faster than you can count to three.",
		"Practically anything of value requires that we take a risk of failure or being rejected. This is the price we all must pay for achieving the greater rewards lying ahead of us. To take risks means you will succeed sometime but never to take a risk means that you will never succeed. Life is filled with a lot of risks and challenges and if you want to get away from all these, you will be left behind in the race of life. A person who can never take a risk can’t learn anything. For example, if you never take the risk to drive a car, you can never learn to drive. If you never take the risk of being rejected, you can never have a friend or partner. Similarly, by not taking the risk of attending an interview, you will never get a job.",
		"A goal‒oriented mind‒set can create a “yo‒yo” effect. Many runners work hard for months, but as soon as they cross the finish line, they stop training. The race is no longer there to motivate them. When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people find themselves returning to their old habits after accomplishing a goal. The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long‒term thinking is goal‒less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.",
		"Learners function within complex developmental, cognitive, physical, social, and cultural systems. Research and theory from diverse fields have contributed to an evolving understanding that all learners grow and learn in culturally defined ways in culturally defined contexts. While humans share basic brain structures and processes, as well as fundamental experiences such as relationships with family, age­related stages, and many more, each of these phenomena is shaped by an individual’s precise experiences. Learning does not happen in the same way for all people because cultural influences are influential from the beginning of life. These ideas about the intertwining of learning and culture have been supported by research on many aspects of learning and development.",
		"FOBO, or Fear of a Better Option, is the anxiety that something better will come along, which makes it undesirable to commit to existing choices when making a decision. It’s an affliction of abundance that drives you to keep all of your options open and to avoid risks. Rather than assessing your options, choosing one, and moving on with your day, you delay the inevitable. It’s not unlike hitting the snooze button on your alarm clock only to pull the covers over your head and fall back asleep. As you probably found out the hard way, if you hit snooze enough times, you’ll end up being late and racing for the office, your day and mood ruined. While pressing snooze feels so good at the moment, it ultimately demands a price.",
		"If you care deeply about something, you may place greater value on your ability to succeed in that area of concern. The internal pressure you place on yourself to achieve or do well socially is normal and useful, but when you doubt your ability to succeed in areas that are important to you, your self­worth suffers. Situations are uniquely stressful for each of us based on whether or not they activate our doubt. It’s not the pressure to perform that creates your stress. Rather, it’s the self­doubt that bothers you. Doubt causes you to see positive, neutral, and even genuinely negative experiences more negatively and as a reflection of your own shortcomings. When you see situations and your strengths more objectively, you are less likely to have doubt as the source of your distress.",
		"Rather than attempting to punish students with a low grade or mark in the hope it will encourage them to give greater effort in the future, teachers can better motivate students by considering their work as incomplete and then requiring additional effort. Teachers at Beachwood Middle School in Beachwood, Ohio, record students’ grades as A, B, C, or I(Incomplete). Students who receive an I grade are required to do additional work in order to bring their performance up to an acceptable level. This policy is based on the belief that students perform at a failure level or submit failing work in large part because teachers accept it. The Beachwood teachers reason that if they no longer accept substandard work, students will not submit it. And with appropriate support, they believe students will continue to work until their performance is satisfactory.",
		"It’s important that you think independently and fight for what you believe in, but there comes a time when it’s wiser to stop fighting for your view and move on to accepting what a trustworthy group of people think is best. This can be extremely difficult. But it’s smarter, and ultimately better for you to be open­minded and have faith that the conclusions of a trustworthy group of people are better than whatever you think. If you can’t understand their view, you’re probably just blind to their way of thinking. If you continue doing what you think is best when all the evidence and trustworthy people are against you, you’re being dangerously confident. The truth is that while most people can become incredibly open­minded, some can’t, even after they have repeatedly encountered lots of pain from betting that they were right when they were not.",
		"Information is worthless if you never actually use it. Far too often, companies collect valuable customer information that ends up buried and never used. They must ensure their data is accessible for use at the appropriate times. For a hotel, one appropriate time for data usage is check-in at the front desk. I often check in at a hotel I’ve visited frequently, only for the people at the front desk to give no indication that they recognize me as a customer. The hotel must have stored a record of my visits, but they don’t make that information accessible to the front desk clerks. They are missing a prime opportunity to utilize data to create a better experience focused on customer loyalty. Whether they have ten customers, ten thousand, or even ten million, the goal is the same: create a delightful customer experience that encourages loyalty.",
		"Many people view sleep as merely a “down time” when their brain shuts off and their body rests. In a rush to meet work, school, family, or household responsibilities, people cut back on their sleep, thinking it won’t be a problem, because all of these other activities seem much more important. But research reveals that a number of vital tasks carried out during sleep help to maintain good health and enable people to function at their best. While you sleep, your brain is hard at work forming the pathways necessary for learning and creating memories and new insights. Without enough sleep, you can’t focus and pay attention or respond quickly. A lack of sleep may even cause mood problems. In addition, growing evidence shows that a continuous lack of sleep increases the risk for developing serious diseases.",
		"Your emotions deserve attention and give you important pieces of information. However, they can also sometimes be an unreliable, inaccurate source of information. You may feel a certain way, but that does not mean those feelings are reflections of the truth. You may feel sad and conclude that your friend is angry with you when her behavior simply reflects that she’s having a bad day. You may feel depressed and decide that you did poorly in an interview when you did just fine. Your feelings can mislead you into thinking things that are not supported by facts.",
		"A recent study from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, called “When Too Much of a Good Thing May Be Bad,” indicates that classrooms with too much decoration are a source of distraction for young children and directly affect their cognitive performance. Being visually overstimulated, the children have a great deal of difficulty concentrating and end up with worse academic results. On the other hand, if there is not much decoration on the classroom walls, the children are less distracted, spend more time on their activities, and learn more. So it’s our job, in order to support their attention, to find the right balance between excessive decoration and the complete absence of it.",
		"The old saying is that “knowledge is power,” but when it comes to scary, threatening news, research suggests the exact opposite. Frightening news can actually rob people of their inner sense of control, making them less likely to take care of themselves and other people. Public health research shows that when the news presents health-related information in a pessimistic way, people are actually less likely to take steps to protect themselves from illness as a result. A news article that’s intended to warn people about increasing cancer rates, for example, can result in fewer people choosing to get screened for the disease because they’re so terrified of what they might find. This is also true for issues such as climate change. When a news story is all doom and gloom, people feel depressed and become less interested in taking small, personal steps to fight ecological collapse.",
		"When students are starting their college life, they may approach every course, test, or learning task the same way, using what we like to call “the rubber­stamp approach.” Think about it this way: Would you wear a tuxedo to a baseball game? A colorful dress to a funeral? A bathing suit to religious services? Probably not. You know there’s appropriate dress for different occasions and settings. Skillful learners know that “putting on the same clothes” won’t work for every class. They are flexible learners. They have different strategies and know when to use them. They know that you study for multiple­choice tests differently than you study for essay tests. And they not only know what to do, but they also know how to do it.",
		"The promise of a computerized society, we were told, was that it would pass to machines all of the repetitive drudgery of work, allowing us humans to pursue higher purposes and to have more leisure time. It didn’t work out this way. Instead of more time, most of us have less. Companies large and small have off­loaded work onto the backs of consumers. Things that used to be done for us, as part of the value­added service of working with a company, we are now expected to do ourselves. With air travel, we’re now expected to complete our own reservations and check­in, jobs that used to be done by airline employees or travel agents. At the grocery store, we’re expected to bag our own groceries and, in some supermarkets, to scan our own purchases.",
		"We all negotiate every day, whether we realise it or not. Yet few people ever learn how to negotiate. Those who do usually learn the traditional, win­lose negotiating style rather than an approach that is likely to result in a win­win agreement. This old­school, adversarial approach may be useful in a one­off negotiation where you will probably not deal with that person again. However, such transactions are becoming increasingly rare, because most of us deal with the same people repeatedly — our spouses and children, our friends and colleagues, our customers and clients. In view of this, it’s essential to achieve successful results for ourselves and maintain a healthy relationship with our negotiating partners at the same time. In today’s interdependent world of business partnerships and long­term relationships, a win­win outcome is fast becoming the only acceptable result.",
		"When writing a novel, research for information needs to be done. The thing is that some kinds of fiction demand a higher level of detail: crime fiction, for example, or scientific thrillers. The information is never hard to find; one website for authors even organizes trips to police stations, so that crime writers can get it right. Often, a polite letter will earn you permission to visit a particular location and record all the details that you need. But remember that you will drive your readers to boredom if you think that you need to pack everything you discover into your work. The details that matter are those that reveal the human experience. The crucial thing is telling a story, finding the characters, the tension, and the conflict―not the train timetable or the building blueprint.",
		"When we think of leaders, we may think of people such as Abraham Lincoln or Martin Luther King, Jr. If you consider the historical importance and far­reaching influence of these individuals, leadership might seem like a noble and high goal. But like all of us, these people started out as students, workers, and citizens who possessed ideas about how some aspect of daily life could be improved on a larger scale. Through diligence and experience, they improved upon their ideas by sharing them with others, seeking their opinions and feedback and constantly looking for the best way to accomplish goals for a group. Thus we all have the potential to be leaders at school, in our communities, and at work, regardless of age or experience.",
		"People often don’t consider purchasing boats, renting a beach house, or taking care of pool maintenance during the winter, but that’s exactly when you should be looking for good deals on these things. Providers of those items or services are often less busy at those times. So you’ll get a warmer reception than you would during the busy season when there’s more demand. That doesn’t mean you have to plan your vacation at the beach in December. But you are more likely to have a fruitful negotiation if you begin the discussion in the off­season.",
		"If idling away in front of a TV is your favorite daily hobby, it may lead you to an early death. That’s what Australian researchers found after tracking nearly 9,000 people for an average of six years. Regardless of whether or not they were overweight, subjects who watched television for more than four hours daily had a 46 percent higher risk of premature death, compared with subjects who channel­surfed for less than two hours a day. “Television itself isn’t the problem,” says study author David Dunstan. Instead, the danger comes from all that sitting, which takes the place of activity-including even the lightest kind that naturally occurs when you are not glued to the tube. “Too much sitting is, simply, bad for you,” Dunstan says.",
		"By nearly all insider and expert accounts, we are or will be at peak oil somewhere between now and the next five years. Even if we did not have profound concerns about climate change, we would need to be looking for different ways to power our civilization. How fortunate we are to have a safe nuclear facility a mere ninety­three million miles away. I hope I live to see the full flourishing of solar technology. Concentrated solar power to superheat steam, electric mobility and electricity storage are part of this new quest. My hope is that architects will be drawn to designing gorgeous arrays and solar towers in the desert. Could it be possible that in two or three decades we will look back and wonder why we ever thought we had a problem when we are bathed in such a sweet rain of photons?",
		"A symbol differs from an imitative representation. It stands for something else but does not attempt to accurately duplicate it. A connection between a symbol and its referent is not necessarily causal as is a visual representation of, for example, a living room on television. The heart-shaped symbol ‘♥’ stands for the word ‘love’ in our culture, but the connection between the symbol and its meaning had to be learned. In a culture where the heart-shaped symbol has no known meaning, it is unlikely to get a response, or it may get a different response. In other words, a symbol is understood only because there are shared conventional meanings.",
		"When human beings take in excess energy in the form of food at a given meal or snack, the extra calories tend to reduce hunger at the next meal or snack. But this mechanism doesn’t seem to be fully functional when excess calories are consumed in the form of liquids. If, for example, you begin taking in an extra 200 calories a day by eating a sandwich, you’ll tend to reduce your caloric intake by the same amount at the next meal or over the course of the day. On the other hand, if you take in an extra 200 calories by drinking a soft drink, your body won’t activate the same mechanism, and you probably won’t end up reducing your daily caloric intake at all. In the long run, you’ll end up gaining weight.",
		"Imagine you are climbing a rock wall in the mountains. You are halfway up the wall, hundreds of feet above the valley floor. You have just come to a small ledge. You know you would be vulnerable if the wind picked up, but on that ledge you have at least some sense of security. The problem is that to keep moving up, you have to abandon the security and reach for another hold. Letting go of that sense of security is the challenge, whether you are rock climbing or taking a new path in life. You have to release your hold on the old and grab on to the new.",
		"Many times I have noticed coaches and parents choose the wrong time to explain concepts to children. A perfect example of this is while the children are playing a game. As a coach, the only time I would talk strategy was during a time­out or after the game. This is because it is really difficult for children to play and listen at the same time. I would only say words of encouragement while the children were playing. You might have seen a father watching his son playing a game in a field, yelling at him to point out his errors. The game continues to be played while the child is trying to pay attention to what his father is telling him. Children need to be able to concentrate on the task at hand. Children can play, or they can listen, but like adults, it’s almost impossible for them to do both at once.",
		"The concept of ‘degrowth’ asks: “do I really need this object, or am I buying it because I like the feeling of buying something?” It originated from the ideas of ecological economics and anti-consumerism. The key to the concept is that reducing your consumption will not reduce your wellbeing; rather, it will maximize your happiness by allowing you to have more time and savings to spend on things like art, music, family, and community. Today we consume 26 times more stuff than we did 60 years ago. But ask yourself: are we 26 times happier? Consider what Mahatma Gandhi said: “Not all our gold and jewelry could satisfy our hunger and quench our thirst.”",
		"Curiosity is the essence of life. Animals including humans cannot live without knowing what is useful to them and what is needed for their survival: where to find food, how to avoid predators, where to find mates, etc. However, the human species differs from other animals because we thirst for knowledge that reaches far beyond our personal needs. We look around us and we wonder. We wonder about our surroundings and about what we observe both near and far and we want to understand it all. Indeed, we fear the unknown. This sense of wonder and desire for understanding not only makes us human, but is also one of the foundation stones of civilization.",
		"We began helping in the kitchen when we each turned three years old. We’re sure that, at that age, we were more of a hindrance than help, but because our mom thought cooking was a good learning tool, she tolerated all of the mess that we made. Of course, we didn’t care about any of that learning stuff, we just thought it was fun, and we still do. We learned to cook through trial and many errors. We can’t tell you how many times we have dropped eggs on the floor, coated the kitchen in flour, or boiled things over on the stove. The point is, if there is a mistake that could be made, we have made it. But, as our mom always says, mistakes are the best teachers. Through those mistakes we have learned what works and definitely what doesn’t.",
		"Some organizations may be reluctant to facilitate their employees’ participation in volunteer activities. They may believe it’s none of their business: if employees want to do volunteer activity, they can make their own arrangements and do so on their own time. Corporations also may be concerned about allocating the resources needed to set up such programs, or perhaps they fear that facilitating employees’ engagement elsewhere may weaken their commitment to the organization or their jobs. Not to worry on that last point: research shows that participating in corporate volunteer activity heightens rather than weakens employees’ organizational commitment, in part because people feel a sense of self­worth when they do the good deeds that their organizations made it easier for them to do.",
		"Studies show that narrative feedback on students’ performance is better than grades at both promoting kids’ self-motivation to learn and boosting their achievement. Primary school teachers do a good job of providing feedback in reports, but as soon as grades take over from narrative comments as the main method of evaluation, students and parents begin to lose out. When teachers offer information such as “You did a great job of planning your ideas for this paper, and formulating your main argument, but your body paragraphs don’t address the question raised by the argument,” in response to a rough draft of a paper, the student has information that praises the positive elements, addresses failures, and gives useful information for her better performance. In this way, informational feedback works much like praise for efforts, and similarly boosts enthusiasm for the task and later performance.",
		"Much has been written and said about positive self­talk― for example, repeating to ourselves “I am wonderful” when we feel down, “I am strong” when going through a difficult time, or “I am getting better every day in every way” each morning in front of the mirror. The evidence that this sort of pep talk works is weak, and there are psychologists who suggest that it can actually hurt more than it can help. Little, unfortunately, has been written about real self­talk, acknowledging honestly what we are feeling at a given point. When feeling down, saying “I am really sad” or “I feel so torn”―to ourselves or to someone we trust―is much more helpful than declaring “I am tough” or “I am happy.”",
		"The effects of climate change will not be equally distributed across the globe, and there are likely to be winners and losers as the planet warms. Regarding climate effects in general, developing countries are likely to experience more negative effects of global warming. Not only do many developing countries have naturally warmer climates than those in the developed world, they also rely more heavily on climate sensitive sectors such as agriculture, forestry, and tourism. As temperatures rise further, regions such as Africa will face declining crop yields and will struggle to produce sufficient food for domestic consumption, while their major exports will likely fall in volume. This effect will be made worse for these regions if developed countries are able to make up for the fall in agricultural output with new sources, potentially from their own domestic economies as their land becomes more suitable for growing crops.",
		"Nervousness about public speaking is one of the most common fears among people. It can serve as a real and significant barrier to effective communication and ultimately to academic and professional success. Debate is an ideal setting to develop coping strategies that allow people to manage their speech anxiety. Because debate both requires and allows for a lot of preparation, individuals develop confidence in their materials and passion for the ideas they support. Debate provides a focus on the content over style, so the attention is on the arguments, not on the person. Participants may forget to be nervous as they have so much else to think about. And repetition of experience helps them build confidence and learn to cope with their inevitable nervousness in such a way as to prevent it from interfering with their objectives.",
		"Are you a rushaholic? Do you happen to live in a fast-paced city, where you feel in a constant hurry? A recent poll of over 1,000 Americans found that nearly half felt they lacked enough time in daily life. Time famine the feeling of having too much to do and not enough time to do it is the cause of unnecessary stress and reduced performance. We all tend to rush when we have so many things to do, and that negatively affects our performance. Doing things quickly actually ends up slowing you down, such as when you rush out of your house only to realize you forgot your keys, phone, or wallet on the kitchen table. Driving faster will not get you to your destination any sooner. Assuming that by doing things faster you will get more done is a trap.",
		"Playing any game that involves more than one person teaches kids teamwork, the consequences of cheating, and how to be a good team player whether they win or lose. It’s not hard to see how those skills make it into the daily lives of kids. But like all things we hope to teach our children, learning to cooperate or to compete fairly takes practice. Humans aren’t naturally good at losing, so there will be tears, yelling, and cheating, but that’s okay. The point is, playing games together helps kids with their socialization. It allows them a safe place to practice getting along, following rules, and learning how to be graceful in defeat.",
		"When you enter a store, what do you see? It is quite likely that you will see many options and choices. It doesn’t matter whether you want to buy tea, coffee, jeans, or a phone. In all these situations, we are basically flooded with options from which we can choose. What will happen if we ask someone, whether online or offline, if he or she prefers having more alternatives or less? The majority of people will tell us that they prefer having more alternatives. This finding is interesting because, as science suggests, the more options we have, the harder our decision making process will be. The thing is that when the amount of options exceeds a certain level, our decision making will start to suffer.",
		"A Princeton study by Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman found that once a person earns $75,000 per year, the emotional benefits of income wear off. He analyzed more than 450,000 responses to the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, a daily survey of 1,000 U.S. residents conducted by the Gallup Organization, and discovered that emotional well-being rises with income—but not beyond an annual income of $75,000. What is the significance of $75,000? It’s not a magic number. It appears to be the income considered “adequate” to meet people’s basic needs. And the researchers found that lower income did not in itself cause sadness, but made people feel more burdened by the problems they already had. In other words, that old saying “money can’t buy happiness” turns out to be true.",
		"Think of a buffet table at a party, or perhaps at a hotel you’ve visited. You see platter after platter of different foods. You don’t eat many of these foods at home, and you want to try them all. But trying them all might mean eating more than your usual meal size. The availability of different types of food is one factor in gaining weight. Scientists have seen this behavior in studies with rats: Rats that normally maintain a steady body weight when eating one type of food eat huge amounts and become obese when they are presented with a variety of high­calorie foods, such as chocolate bars, crackers, and potato chips. The same is true of humans. We eat much more when a variety of good­tasting foods are available than when only one or two types of food are available.",
		"If you’re an expert, having a high follower count on your social media accounts enhances all the work you are doing in real life. A great example is a comedian. She spends hours each day working on her skill, but she keeps being asked about her Instagram following. This is because businesses are always looking for easier and cheaper ways to market their products. A comedian with 100,000 followers can promote her upcoming show and increase the chances that people will buy tickets to come see her. This reduces the amount of money the comedy club has to spend on promoting the show and makes the management more likely to choose her over another comedian. Plenty of people are upset that follower count seems to be more important than talent, but it’s really about firing on all cylinders. In today’s version of show business, the business part is happening online. You need to adapt, because those who don’t adapt won’t make it very far.",
		"Recording an interview is easier and more thorough, and can be less unnerving to an interviewee than seeing someone scribbling in a notebook. But using a recorder has some disadvantages and is not always the best solution. If the interview lasts a while, listening to it again to select the quotes you wish to use can be time­consuming, especially if you are working to a tight deadline. It is often more efficient to develop the technique (using a recorder as backup if you wish) of selective note­taking. This involves writing down the key answers from an interview so that they can be transcribed easily afterwards. It is sensible to take down more than you think you’ll need, but try to get into the habit of editing out the material you are not going to need as the interview proceeds. It makes the material much easier and quicker to handle afterwards.",
		"You meet many different kinds of people in your life. Sometimes you run into those who are full of energy, and you wonder if they are from the same planet as you. After a closer look, you realize that they too face challenges and problems. They are under the same amount of pressure and stress as you. One word makes a world of difference: attitude! Attitude is your psychological disposition, a proactive way to approach life. It is a personal predetermination not to let anything or anyone take control of your life or manipulate your mood. Attitude allows you to anticipate, excuse, forgive and forget, without being naive or stupid. It is a personal decision to stay in control and not to lose your temper. Attitude provides safe conduct through all kinds of storms. It helps you to get up every morning happy and determined to get the most out of a brand new day. Whatever happens―good or bad―the proper attitude makes the difference. It may not always be easy to have a positive attitude; nevertheless, you need to remember you can face a kind or cruel world based on your perception and your actions.",
		"Many of the leaders I know in the media industry are intelligent, capable, and honest. But they are leaders of companies that appear to have only one purpose: the single­minded pursuit of short­term profit and “shareholder value.” I believe, however, that the media industry, by its very nature and role in our society and global culture, must act differently than other industries—especially because they have the free use of our public airwaves and our digital spectrum, and have almost unlimited access to our children’s hearts and minds. These are priceless assets, and the right to use them should necessarily carry serious and long­lasting responsibilities to promote the public good.",
		"Personal blind spots are areas that are visible to others but not to you. The developmental challenge of blind spots is that you don’t know what you don’t know. Like that area in the side mirror of your car where you can’t see that truck in the lane next to you, personal blind spots can easily be overlooked because you are completely unaware of their presence. They can be equally dangerous as well. That truck you don’t see? It’s really there! So are your blind spots. Just because you don’t see them, doesn’t mean they can’t run you over. This is where you need to enlist the help of others. You have to develop a crew of special people, people who are willing to hold up that mirror, who not only know you well enough to see that truck, but who also care enough about you to let you know that it’s there.",
		"The psychology professor Dr. Kelly Lambert’s research explains that keeping what she calls the “effort­driven rewards circuit” well engaged helps you deal with challenges in the environment around you or in your emotional life more effectively and efficiently. Doing hands­on activities that produce results you can see and touch―such as knitting a scarf, cooking from scratch, or tending a garden― fuels the reward circuit so that it functions optimally. She argues that the documented increase in depression among Americans may be directly correlated with the decline of purposeful physical activity. When we work with our hands, it increases the release of the neurochemicals dopamine and serotonin, both responsible for generating positive emotions. She also explains that working with our hands gives us a greater sense of control over our environment and more connection to the world around us. All of which contributes to a reduction in stress and anxiety and builds resilience against the onset of depression.",
		"The vast majority of companies, schools, and organizations measure and reward “high performance” in terms of individual metrics such as sales numbers, résumé accolades, and test scores. The problem with this approach is that it is based on a belief we thought science had fully confirmed: that we live in a world of “survival of the fittest.” It teaches us that those with the best grades, or the most impressive résumé, or the highest point score, will be the ONLY ones to succeed. The formula is simple: be better and smarter and more creative than everyone else, and you will be successful. But this formula is inaccurate. Thanks to new research, we now know that achieving our highest potential is not about survival of the fittest but survival of the best fit. In other words, success is not just about how creative or smart or driven you are, but how well you are able to connect with, contribute to, and benefit from the ecosystem of people around you.",
		"Fears of damaging ecosystems are based on the sound conservationist principle that we should aim to minimize the disruption we cause, but there is a risk that this principle may be confused with the old idea of a ‘balance of nature.’ This supposes a perfect order of nature that will seek to maintain itself and that we should not change. It is a romantic, not to say idyllic, notion, but deeply misleading because it supposes a static condition. Ecosystems are dynamic, and although some may endure, apparently unchanged, for periods that are long in comparison with the human lifespan, they must and do change eventually. Species come and go, climates change, plant and animal communities adapt to altered circumstances, and when examined in fine detail such adaptation and consequent change can be seen to be taking place constantly. The ‘balance of nature’ is a myth. Our planet is dynamic, and so are the arrangements by which its inhabitants live together.",
		"When it comes to the decision to get more exercise, you are setting goals that are similar to running a half marathon with very little training! You make a decision to buy a gym membership and decide to spend an hour at the gym every day. Well, you might stick to that for a day or two, but chances are you won’t be able to continue to meet that commitment in the long term. If, however, you make a commitment to go jogging for a few minutes a day or add a few sit­ups to your daily routine before bed, then you are far more likely to stick to your decision and to create a habit that offers you long­term results. The key is to start small. Small habits lead to long­term success.",
		"Too many officials in troubled cities wrongly imagine that they can lead their city back to its former glories with some massive construction project―a new stadium or light rail system, a convention center, or a housing project. With very few exceptions, no public policy can slow the tidal forces of urban change. We mustn’t ignore the needs of the poor people who live in the Rust Belt, but public policy should help poor people, not poor places. Shiny new real estate may dress up a declining city, but it doesn’t solve its underlying problems. The hallmark of declining cities is that they have too much housing and infrastructure relative to the strength of their economies. With all that supply of structure and so little demand, it makes no sense to use public money to build more supply. The folly of building­centric urban renewal reminds us that cities aren’t structures; cities are people.",
		"Who is this person? This is the question all stories ask. It emerges first at the ignition point. When the initial change strikes, the protagonist overreacts or behaves in an otherwise unexpected way. We sit up, suddenly attentive. Who is this person who behaves like this? The question then re-emerges every time the protagonist is challenged by the plot and compelled to make a choice. Everywhere in the narrative that the question is present, the reader or viewer will likely be engaged. Where the question is absent, and the events of drama move out of its narrative beam, they are at risk of becoming detached―perhaps even bored. If there’s a single secret to storytelling then I believe it’s this. Who is this person? Or, from the perspective of the character, Who am I? It’s the definition of drama. It is its electricity, its heartbeat, its fire.",
		"Advice from a friend or family member is the most well­meaning of all, but it’s not the best way to match yourself with a new habit. While hot yoga may have changed your friend’s life, does that mean it’s the right practice for you? We all have friends who swear their new habit of getting up at 4:30 a.m. changed their lives and that we have to do it. I don’t doubt that getting up super early changes people’s lives, sometimes in good ways and sometimes not. But be cautious: You don’t know if this habit will actually make your life better, especially if it means you get less sleep. So yes, you can try what worked for your friend, but don’t beat yourself up if your friend’s answer doesn’t change you in the same way. All of these approaches involve guessing and chance. And that’s not a good way to strive for change in your life.",
		"The problem with simply adopting any popular method of parenting is that it ignores the most important variable in the equation: the uniqueness of your child. So, rather than insist that one style of parenting will work with every child, we might take a page from the gardener’s handbook. Just as the gardener accepts, without question or resistance, the plant’s requirements and provides the right conditions each plant needs to grow and flourish, so, too, do we parents need to custom­design our parenting to fit the natural needs of each individual child. Although that may seem difficult, it is possible. Once we understand who our children really are, we can begin to figure out how to make changes in our parenting style to be more positive and accepting of each child we’ve been blessed to parent.",
		"Most parents think that if our child would just “behave,” we could stay calm as parents. The truth is that managing our own emotions and actions is what allows us to feel peaceful as parents. Ultimately we can’t control our children or the obstacles they will face―but we can always control our own actions. Parenting isn’t about what our child does, but about how we respond. In fact, most of what we call parenting doesn’t take place between a parent and child but within the parent. When a storm brews, a parent’s response will either calm it or trigger a full‐scale tsunami. Staying calm enough to respond constructively to all that childish behavior―and the stormy emotions behind it―requires that we grow, too. If we can use those times when our buttons get pushed to reflect, not just react, we can notice when we lose equilibrium and steer ourselves back on track. This inner growth is the hardest work there is, but it’s what enables you to become a more peaceful parent, one day at a time.",
		"In one study, when researchers suggested that a date was associated with a new beginning (such as “the first day of spring”), students viewed it as a more attractive time to kick-start goal pursuit than when researchers presented it as an unremarkable day (such as “the third Thursday in March”). Whether it was starting a new gym habit or spending less time on social media, when the date that researchers suggested was associated with a new beginning, more students wanted to begin changes right then. And more recent research by a different team found that similar benefits were achieved by showing goal seekers modified weekly calendars. When calendars depicted the current day (either Monday or Sunday) as the first day of the week, people reported feeling more motivated to make immediate progress on their goals.",
		"Brands that fail to grow and develop lose their relevance. Think about the person you knew who was once on the fast track at your company, who is either no longer with the firm or, worse yet, appears to have hit a plateau in his or her career. Assuming he or she did not make an ambitious move, more often than not, this individual is a victim of having failed to stay relevant and embrace the advances in his or her industry. Think about the impact personal computing technology had on the first wave of executive leadership exposed to the technology. Those who embraced the technology were able to integrate it into their work styles and excel. Those who were resistant many times found few opportunities to advance their careers and in many cases were ultimately let go through early retirement for failure to stay relevant and update their skills.",
		"Perhaps, the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the workplace may bode well for Emotional Intelligence (EI). As AI gains momentum and replaces people in jobs at every level, predictions are, there will be a premium placed on people who have high ability in EI. The emotional messages people send and respond to while interacting are, at this point, far beyond the ability of AI programs to mimic. As we get further into the age of the smart machine, it is likely that sensing and managing emotions will remain one type of intelligence that puzzles AI. This means people and jobs involving EI are safe from being taken over by machines. In a survey, almost three out of four executives see EI as a “must­have” skill for the workplace in the future as the automatizing of routine tasks bumps up against the impossibility of creating effective AI for activities that require emotional skill.",
		"It’s remarkable that positive fantasies help us relax to such an extent that it shows up in physiological tests. If you want to unwind, you can take some deep breaths, get a massage, or go for a walk―but you can also try simply closing your eyes and fantasizing about some future outcome that you might enjoy. But what about when your objective is to make your wish a reality? The last thing you want to be is relaxed. You want to be energized enough to get off the couch and lose those pounds or find that job or study for that test, and you want to be motivated enough to stay engaged even when the inevitable obstacles or challenges arise. The principle of “Dream it. Wish it. Do it.” does not hold true, and now we know why: in dreaming it, you undercut the energy you need to do it. You put yourself in a temporary state of complete happiness, calmness―and inactivity.",
		"Many historians have pointed to the significance of accurate time measurement to Western economic progress. The French historian Jacques Le Goff called the birth of the public mechanical clock a turning point in Western society. Until the late Middle Ages, people had sun or water clocks, which did not play any meaningful role in business activities. Market openings and activities started with the sunrise and typically ended at noon when the sun was at its peak. But when the first public mechanical clocks were introduced and spread across European cities, market times were set by the stroke of the hour. Public clocks thus greatly contributed to public life and work by providing a new concept of time that was easy for everyone to understand. This, in turn, helped facilitate trade and commerce. Interactions and transactions between consumers, retailers, and wholesalers became less irregular. Important town meetings began to follow the pace of the clock, allowing people to better plan their time and allocate resources in a more efficient manner.",
		"We tend to overrate the impact of new technologies in part because older technologies have become absorbed into the furniture of our lives, so as to be almost invisible. Take the baby bottle. Here is a simple implement that has transformed a fundamental human experience for vast numbers of infants and mothers, yet it finds no place in our histories of technology. This technology might be thought of as a classic time­shifting device, as it enables mothers to exercise more control over the timing of feeding. It can also function to save time, as bottle feeding allows for someone else to substitute for the mother’s time. Potentially, therefore, it has huge implications for the management of time in everyday life, yet it is entirely overlooked in discussions of high­speed society.",
		"A painter I know can’t do anything in her studio without rock’n’roll pounding out of the speakers. Turning it on turns on a switch inside her. The beat gets her going. It’s the metronome for her creative life. A writer friend can only write outside. He can’t stand the thought of being tied indoors to his word processor while a “great day” is unfolding outside. So he carries his coffee mug out to work in the warmth of an open porch in his backyard. Mystically, he now believes he is missing nothing. In the end, there is no one ideal condition for creativity. What works for one person is useless for another. The only criterion is this: Make it easy on yourself. Find a working environment where the prospect of wrestling with your muse doesn’t scare you, doesn’t shut you down. It should make you want to be there, and once you find it, stick with it.",
		"Child-rearing experts always caution parents not to tell children they’re bad when they misbehave, but rather to scold them for doing bad things. This concept applies to adults, as well. Good people occasionally do bad things, and bad people sometimes behave like angels. In looking for patterns, it is critical not to confuse occasional behavior or feelings with a more permanent personality trait or quality. If you’re considering rehiring someone who worked for you a few years earlier, you’d be wise to recall your past experience with him. But you’d be ill-advised to base the decision on a single occasion when he disagreed with you, unless you saw other behavior that indicated he was argumentative by nature. Isolated episodes don’t usually reveal a permanent state of mind. As you search for patterns, ask yourself whether the clue you are evaluating is just an isolated event.",
		"On the path to excellence, some obstacles may initially seem overwhelming. Every performer experiences this feeling, even the greatest performers in the world. If you believe that the obstacles are too great to overcome, you will prove yourself right even when you are wrong. Most seemingly impossible obstacles can be overcome by seeing possibilities, focusing on what is within your control, taking the first step, and then focusing on the next step and the next step after that. If your commitment becomes weak, remember your dream and why it is important to you, find simple joys in your daily pursuits, rejoice in the little victories or small steps forward, and embrace the process of ongoing learning. With a positive perspective and persistence, you will get through and find a way through all obstacles.",
		"“Where there’s a will with power, there’s a way.” The way comes after the will with power. You must be hungry enough, strong enough, resilient enough, to desire change and make change happen. You’ve got the will with power, so now you can define your course. Your course is critical. But there is not any one course for any one journey. A wise person once told me that what’s important is not so much the path you’re on as the direction you’re headed. You may get bumped off your path, pushed this way and that, but if your direction is true, your journey will be true. A roadblock may require a change of path, but your destination remains the same. So what is your way? It is the path you define, day by day, to get you to your dream. It takes will power to define your way.",
		"One reason many people keep delaying things they should do is that they fear they will do them wrong or poorly, so they just don’t do them at all. For example, one of the best ways to write a book is to write it as quickly as possible, getting your thoughts onto paper without regard to style. Then, you can go back to revise and polish your writing. If I only wrote when I knew it would be perfect, I’d still be working on my first book! Do you have a hard time relaxing if your house is a mess? Do you beat yourself up for making mistakes? I’ve got a simple message for you today: It’s time to let go of your perfectionism. It becomes a stumbling block that keeps you stuck.",
		"The two­year­old child dances for her father when he comes home, before he takes her in his arms. The smallest child who is capable of any action is capable of making it worth watching, of capturing adult attention for a time. As we grow up we learn that we cannot expect the attention of others as often as we would like to have it; still we are watchers of ourselves and of each other, and if we believe in God or gods we believe we are being watched from above. Even if we don’t, we can’t always escape the thought that our parents are watching us. In deciding what to do or how to do it, we often ask ourselves what these watchers would think of us. And then we pretend. We tell ourselves stories about what we are doing as individuals, framing our actions all the while as deserving an audience. To imagine yourself totally without an audience would be painful and difficult.",
		"People love to tell others what to do; they believe giving advice is ‘helpful,’ even if the advice is not requested. Such telling worked in the Industrial Era because it was hierarchical in structure. This communication style implied the teller inherently had valuable information to provide and knew the correct solution. In the Information Age, people have more equal access to knowledge and, with the help of technology, are generally able to find their own solutions. If someone wants advice, they will ask for it. In general, telling is no longer well received. It can be perceived as lacking in respect, narrowing opportunities and shutting down possibilities by implying that the individual is incapable of solving a problem.",
		"Piglet was suffering from the very essence of worry. His mind was filled with all manner of possible horrors and disasters. “Supposing that......,” “What if......,” and their variants are the hallmark of worry and anxiety. “Supposing a tree fell down, Pooh, when we were underneath it?” Of course it is possible. All kinds of dreadful things could happen today or tomorrow. But most of them are very unlikely. Once you allow yourself to worry about the unlikely, there is no end to worrying. Imagine looking back on a life of worry about the unlikely. It would be a life spoiled by anxiety about things, the vast majority of which never happened. Whenever you catch yourself worrying that something dreadful might happen, answer the Piglet in yourself with Pooh’s reply: “Supposing it didn’t.” Tackling existing problems is quite enough; do not waste energy and happiness on problems which do not exist.",
		"There is strong research evidence that children perform better in mathematics if music is incorporated in it. It has been shown that mathematics is related with music in various known ways so much that not putting the relationship to good use in and out of school could only be to our disadvantage. Researchers at a Los Angeles school found that 136 second year elementary school pupils who learned to play the piano and read music improved their numeracy skills. This could be so since learning music emphasizes thinking in space and time, and when pupils learn rhythm, they are learning ratios, fractions and proportions. Other researchers investigated the ways in which first and third grade teachers could integrate music into their regular math classrooms. They concluded that music-math integrated lessons had positive effects on three mathematical ability areas of modeling, problem solving and application.",
		"The surface of the earth is different from place to place. Places differ in terms of population size, language, resources, environmental factors, industrial specialization, local history, and human activities. It is these differences from place to place that generate the demand for transportation. People want commodities that are not produced locally—for example, fruits, vegetables, televisions, shoes, paper, and thousands of other goods—and this desire generates the demand for transportation. Businesses need resources that are often not available locally, and this need generates the demand for transportation. We work, shop, and seek entertainment, for the most part, outside our own neighborhoods, necessitating a journey to work, to shop, and to visit the multiplex. Transportation enables us to carry out all these activities.",
		"Guiding students’ progress through the math curriculum in a way that promotes successful, long-term learning and positive math attitudes requires paying attention to their different levels of achievable challenge and different learning strengths. Through this construct, students become engaged and open to acquiring the skills they need to progress to the next level. Individualized achievable challenge connects students to knowledge by communicating high expectations, confirming that they have the capacity to reach these goals, and showing them how to access the tools and support they need to reach goals they consider desirable. By engaging students and ensuring that they succeed frequently, we empower those who have math negativity by providing a sense of their growing knowledge of and appreciation for math.",
		"When we see a happy face (or an angry one), it subtly generates the corresponding emotion in us. To the degree we take on the pace, posture, and facial expression of another person, we start to inhabit their emotional space; as our body mimics the other’s, we begin to experience emotional matching. Our nervous system is automatically set to engage in this emotional empathy. But how well we use this capacity is largely a learned ability. Animals－and people－who have been raised in extreme social isolation are poor at reading emotional cues in those around them not because they lack the basic circuitry for empathy but because, lacking emotional tutors, they have never learned to pay attention to these messages and so haven’t practiced this skill.",
		"Before the Internet, most professional occupations required a large body of knowledge, accumulated over years or even decades of experience. But now anyone with good critical thinking skills and the ability to focus on the important information can retrieve it on demand from the Internet instead of from his own memory. However, those with wandering minds, who might once have been able to focus by isolating themselves with their work, now often find they must do their work with the Internet, which simultaneously furnishes a wide range of unrelated information about their friends’ doings, celebrity news, and millions of other sources of distraction. How well an employee can focus might now be more important than how knowledgeable he is. Knowledge was once an internal property, and focus on the task at hand could be imposed externally; with the Internet, knowledge can be supplied externally but focus must be achieved internally.",
		"One of the most demanding, and at the same time inspiring, aspects of translating for children is the potential for such creativity that arises from what Peter Hollindale has called the ‘childness’ of children’s texts: ‘the quality of being a child― dynamic, imaginative, experimental, interactive and unstable’. The ‘unstable’ qualities of childhood that Hollindale cites require a writer or translator to have an understanding of the freshness of language to the child’s eye and ear, the child’s affective concerns and the linguistic and dramatic play of early childhood. Translating sound, for example, whether in the read-aloud qualities of books for the younger child, in animal noises, children’s poetry or in nonsense rhymes, demands imaginative solutions―as indeed does working with visual material. Such multi-faceted creativity has, at times, placed children’s literature at the forefront of imaginative experimentation.",
		"In England, Dr. Peter Messent followed people on their walks through city parks and found that people with dogs were much more likely to be engaged in conversation than people who were walking alone. People with pets were even more approachable than mothers with small infants. The same kind of results were observed in another study, by Randall Lockwood. He showed subjects a series of relatively ambiguous pictures of people in a variety of common social settings. There were two similar sets of pictures: in one there were only people, and in the other there was a pet with one of the people in each scene. The subjects were asked to rate each of the people in the pictures according to several scales. The results were predictable. People with pets were perceived as being more socially attractive and as having more desirable personal characteristics. Pets changed the people’s social identity for the better.",
		"Anyone who has tried to complete a jigsaw puzzle as the clock ticked on toward a deadline knows that the more they struggle to find the missing pieces, the harder it is to find them. As soon as the clock stops, on the other hand, the pieces virtually find each other. Why do the answers we missed in an exam so often occur to us as soon as we turn in the test? The answer, surely, is that we are trying too hard. We are trying in an anxious or frustrated way, and not surprisingly, this makes us tense up. This kind of trying results from doubt. If we didn’t doubt our ability to perform the task at hand, we wouldn’t need to try. You don’t “try” to sit down and pick up the newspaper when you get home from work, do you?",
		"Why do we need to routinely have the oil changed in our automobiles? Why do we need to see our dentist twice a year? The simple answer to these questions is preventative maintenance. How many times have you heard of stories where people ignored the warning signs and adverse situations seemed to present themselves overnight? A friend of mine knew there was a nail in one of his front tires, but there didn’t seem to be any obvious damage to the tire. He chose to ignore the nail until he found himself on the side of the highway with a flat tire. He later told me that before he experienced the embarrassment of having a flat, he “planned on getting it fixed when he had the time”. If he would have only taken a few minutes to get the nail removed, he most likely would not have received a flat tire on that particular day.",
		"Parents are quick to inform friends and relatives as soon as their infant holds her head up, reaches for objects, sits by herself, and walks alone. Parental enthusiasm for these motor accomplishments is not at all misplaced, for they are, indeed, milestones of development. With each additional skill, babies gain control over their bodies and the environment in a new way. Infants who are able to sit alone are granted an entirely different perspective on the world than are those who spend much of their day on their backs or stomachs. Coordinated reaching opens up a whole new avenue for exploration of objects, and when babies can move about, their opportunities for independent exploration and manipulation are multiplied. No longer are they restricted to their immediate locale and to objects that others place before them. As new ways of controlling the environment are achieved, motor development provides the infant with a growing sense of competence and mastery, and it contributes in important ways to the infant’s perceptual and cognitive understanding of the world.",
		"Coach Wooden often described his team as a finely tuned automobile. The top scorer or “star” of the team is the engine. But, no matter how powerful your engine is, you won’t get very far if you don’t have any wheels. Great scorers need ball handlers and passers to get them the ball. Those who play tenacious defense and put the ball in the scorer’s hands are the wheels. And what of the players at the end of the bench who rarely get in the game? They are the nuts and bolts that hold the wheels in place. Thus, every member of the team is important, from the players on the court to the people who pick up the towels in the locker room. And no one knows when each team member will have the greatest impact: the greatest element in stardom is the rest of the team.",
		"People sometimes make downward social comparisons― comparing themselves to inferior or worse-off others―to feel better about themselves. This is self-enhancement at work. But what happens when the only available comparison target we have is superior or better off than we are? Can self-enhancement motives still be served in such situations? Yes, they can, as captured by the self-evaluation maintenance model. According to this theory, we shift between two processes―reflection and comparison―in a way that lets us maintain favorable self-views. In areas that are not especially relevant to our self-definition, we engage in reflection, whereby we flatter ourselves by association with others’ accomplishments. Suppose you care very little about your own athletic skills, but when your friend scores the winning goal during a critical soccer match, you beam with pride, experience a boost to your self-esteem, and take delight in her victory celebrations as if, by association, it were your victory too.",
		"A new development may take years to evolve. If people are only informed of a new proposal in its final stages, their role is often limited to the negative one of rejecting it. Their protests are then seen by planners and developers as an expensive nuisance, so the public become the ‘enemy’. Many people would like their voices to be heard from the initial stages of a proposed new development, instead of at the last stages of an application. Some architects and developers see this as a threat and insult to their professional skills, rather than a two­way process, beneficial to all parties. Of course the public cannot design a building, but its involvement at an early stage adds to the information available, and replaces a confrontational ‘them and us’ situation by a democratic process of participation and consultation. This situation is now changing as the importance of public consultation becomes increasingly recognised.",
		"Plant and animal species are so diverse that the old saying “beauty is in the eye of the beholder” could be the perfect slogan for nature’s bounty. It’s easy for most people to see the breathtaking beauty found in the brightly colored wings of butterflies, a field of blooming wildflowers, or a forest of hardwood trees in their autumn glory. But what about snails and their trails of slime, rats with yellow teeth, or spiders that look like fierce aliens? These species are beautiful in their own right—just not in a traditional sense. Recognition of their unique beauty may require setting aside any preconceptions—or misconceptions—people may have about fungi, insects, or reptiles. People seem to be hardwired to see warm and fuzzy mammals as cute, while often lacking this innate and immediate attraction to the cold­blooded, eight­legged, or egg­laying members of the animal kingdom. Yet beauty is in no short supply among these animals.",
		"Some might think self-confidence is innate, or it is enough to feel it once and charge through the difficulties of life without hesitation. Bad news. Self-confidence is certainly not innate and there is no universal confidence. Practice and active repetition make the master. Standing up for myself once did start a change in me, but it didn’t grant me unlimited and never-ending confidence. It was just a start, a proof that I could be there for myself. If you have this belief, that you’re there for yourself, every situation seems more bearable, achievable or in my case, survivable. The more times you prove to yourself that you are there for yourself, and you’re enough to handle the situation, the more confident you’ll be.",
		"Internet entrepreneurs are creating job-search products and bringing them online regularly. Within the past few years, new Internet-based businesses have come online that help people find internships, complete online classes tailored to individual employer job applications, or find volunteer work that will lead to full-time employment. Job mastery will mean keeping up with the rapidly evolving tools available on the Internet. It should be noted, though, that no development in the Internet job age has reduced the importance of the most basic job search skill: self-knowledge. Even in the Internet age, the job search starts with identifying individual job skills, sector interests, and preferred workplace environment and interests. Richard Bolles’ best selling job search book, first published in 1970, had as its central theme the self-inventory of skills and workplace preferences. This self-inventory continues to be the starting point for any job search today no matter what the Internet technology involved.",
		"A popular notion with regard to creativity is that constraints hinder our creativity and the most innovative results come from people who have “unlimited” resources. Research shows, however, that creativity loves constraints. In our own agency, we did the best work when we had limited time and client resources. You had to be more creative just to make everything work harder. I have often said our marketing teams were more creative on $5 million accounts than $100 million accounts. Today, when working with startups, I am amazed at the creativity you have to have when you only have $25,000. Perhaps companies should do just the opposite―intentionally apply limits to take advantage of the creative potential of their people.",
		"Consumers like a bottle of wine more if they are told it cost ninety dollars a bottle than if they are told it cost ten. Belief that the wine is more expensive turns on the neurons in the medial orbitofrontal cortex, an area of the brain associated with pleasure feelings. Wine without a price tag doesn’t have this effect. In 2008, American food and wine critics teamed up with a statistician from Yale and a couple of Swedish economists to study the results of thousands of blind tastings of wines ranging from $1.65 to $150 a bottle. They found that when they can’t see the price tag, people prefer cheaper wine to pricier bottles. Experts’ tastes did move in the proper direction: they favored finer, more expensive wines. But the bias was almost imperceptible. A wine that cost ten times more than another was ranked by experts only seven points higher on a scale of one to one hundred.",
		"When science is examined as an enterprise that involves the values of independence, freedom, the right to dissent, and tolerance, it is clear that as a social activity science cannot flourish in an authoritarian climate. Some philosophers of science such as Bronowski claim that science cannot be practiced in authoritarian regimes. In a democratic environment, old ideas can be challenged and rigorously criticized, although with some difficulty because of the human desire to hold onto old ideas, especially by the original proposers. Yet it is the essence of scientific thinking to propose alternative ideas and then to test them against existing concepts. As pointed out in an American Association for the Advancement of Science report, Science for All Americans, “indeed, challenges to new ideas are the legitimate business of science in building valid knowledge.”",
		"At school, our kids are trained to study diligently and individually so they can do better than others on exams. If they seek help on projects from other students, they are criticized for cheating. They are given multiple hours of homework a night, forcing them to trade time with others for more time working in isolation. Over and over they are reminded that their future success in the workplace depends on individual performance, including their grades and standardized test scores. Statistically it doesn’t, but this approach to learning does do one thing: It dramatically raises their stress levels while robbing them of social connection, sleep, attention, happiness, and health. Yet, instead of questioning the system, we judge those who can’t keep up with this fierce competition for individual achievement. By the time students finish school they are exhausted, fragile, and lonely, only to find that the success and happiness they had been promised did not lie at the end of that rainbow.",
		"The impact created by a change in your habits is similar to the effect of shifting the route of an airplane by just a few degrees. Imagine you are flying from Los Angeles to New York City. If a pilot leaving from LAX (Los Angeles International Airport) adjusts the heading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in Washington, D.C., instead of New York. Such a small change is barely noticeable at takeoff―the nose of the airplane moves just a few feet―but when magnified across the entire United States, you end up hundreds of miles apart. Similarly, a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination. Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be. Success is the product of daily habits― not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.",
		"The twenty-first century is the age of information and knowledge. It is a century that is characterized by knowledge as the important resource that gains competitive advantage for companies. To acquire all these knowledge and information, organizations must rely on the data that they store. Data, the basic element, is gathered daily from different input sources. Information is extracted or learned from these sources of data, and this captured information is then transformed into knowledge that is eventually used to trigger actions or decisions. By and large, organizations do not have any problem of not having enough data because most organizations are rich with data. The problem however is that many organizations are poor in information and knowledge. This fact translates into one of the biggest challenges faced by organizations: how to transform raw data into information and eventually into knowledge, which if exploited correctly provides the capabilities to predict customers’ behaviour and business trends.",
		"If you were pushing yourself appropriately and have evaluated yourself rigorously, then you will have identified errors that you made. A critical part of self­evaluation is deciding what caused the errors. Average performers believe their errors were caused by factors outside their control: My opponent got lucky; the task was too hard; I just don’t have any natural ability for this. Top performers, by contrast, believe they are responsible for their errors. Note that this is not just a difference of personality or attitude. The best performers have set highly specific, technique­based goals and strategies for themselves; they have thought through exactly how they intend to achieve what they want. So when something doesn’t work, they can relate the failure to specific elements of their performance that may have misfired. Research on champion golfers, for example, has uncovered precisely this pattern. They’re much less likely than average golfers to blame their problems on the weather, the course, or chance factors. Instead they focus relentlessly on their own performance.",
		"While genetic advancements are often reported as environmentally dependent or modest in effect size in academic publications, these are often translated to the public in deterministic language through the media. Sociologists of genetics argue that media portrayals of genetic influences on health have increased considerably over time, becoming part of the public discourse through which individuals understand symptoms, make help-seeking decisions, and form views of people with particular traits or conditions. The media is the primary source of information about genetic advances and their applications, but it does not provide a neutral discourse. Rather, information is selectively included or ignored, and scientific and clinical implications of genetic discoveries are often inaccurate or overstated. This “genetic optimism” has influenced public opinion, and research suggests that ordinary people are largely accepting of genetic explanations for health and behavior and tend to overestimate the heritability of common diseases for biological relatives.",
		"We tend to think of technology as shiny tools and gadgets. Even if we acknowledge that technology can exist in disembodied form, such as software, we tend not to include in this category paintings, literature, music, dance, poetry, and the arts in general. But we should. If a thousand lines of letters in UNIX qualifies as a technology (the computer code for a web page), then a thousand lines of letters in English (Hamlet) must qualify as well. They both can change our behavior, alter the course of events, or enable future inventions. A Shakespeare sonnet and a Schubert symphony, then, are in the same category as Google’s search engine and the smartphone: They are something useful produced by a mind. We can’t separate out the multiple overlapping technologies responsible for a Lord of the Rings movie. The literary rendering of the original novel is as much an invention as the digital rendering of its fantastical creatures. Both are useful works of the human imagination. Both influence audiences powerfully. Both are technological.",
		"Some company leaders say that their company is going through a lot of change and stress, which they “know” will lower their effectiveness, drive away top talent, and tear apart their teams. They need to think about the military, a place where stress and uncertainty are the status quo, and where employees are on­boarded not with a beach vacation but with boot camp. And yet, the employees of the military remain among the highest functioning, steadfast, and loyal of virtually any organization on the planet. That’s because after centuries of practice, the military has learned that if you go through stress with the right lens, and alongside others, you can create meaningful narratives and social bonds that you will talk about for the rest of your life. Instead of seeing stress as a threat, the military culture derives pride from the shared resilience it creates. And this has nothing to do with the fact that they are soldiers; every company and team can turn stress into wellsprings of potential.",
		"Official definitions of sport have important implications. When a definition emphasizes rules, competition, and high performance, many people will be excluded from participation or avoid other physical activities that are defined as “second class.” For example, when a 12-year-old is cut from an exclusive club soccer team, she may not want to play in the local league because she sees it as “recreational activity” rather than a real sport. This can create a situation in which most people are physically inactive at the same time that a small number of people perform at relatively high levels for large numbers of fans―a situation that negatively impacts health and increases health-care costs in a society or community. When sport is defined to include a wide range of physical activities that are played for pleasure and integrated into local expressions of social life, physical activity rates will be high and overall health benefits are likely.",
		"A question can be raised about the basic notion that sensitivity to problems is critical in setting the creative process in motion. It is no doubt true that many people are motivated to carry out creative activities because of problems they sense in their personal or professional environments. However, there is historical evidence that the creative process can be set in motion without necessity, even in the domain of invention. As one example, consider the invention of the airplane. At the end of the nineteenth century a number of research projects were underway whose purpose was the invention of a flying machine. At that time, there was no need for such a machine; only gradually, after the Wright brothers were successful in inventing the airplane, did the broader implications of that invention become apparent. So the driving force behind the invention of the airplane seems not to have been necessity: There was no need to fly; people simply wanted to.",
		"Music is a human art form, an inseparable part of the human experience everywhere in the world. Music is social, and tightly woven into the tapestry of life, and young children are very much a part of this multifaceted fabric. The musical experiences they have provide opportunities for them to know language, behaviors, customs, traditions, beliefs, values, stories, and other cultural nuances. As they become musically skilled through experiences in song and instrumental music, young children can also grow cultural knowledge and sensitivity. Music is an extremely important aspect of culture, shaping and transmitting the above-mentioned aspects that characterize groups of people. Exposing young children to the world’s musical cultures brings them into the cultural conversation, allowing them to learn about self and others in an artistically meaningful and engaging way. Prior to the development of social biases and cultural preferences that all too easily turn into prejudices, the opportunity to know people through song, dance, and instrument play is a gift to all who work for the well-balanced development of young children into the responsible citizens they will one day become.",
		"The tendency for the market to reward caring for others may just be an incentive to act, or pretend, as if one cares for others. Say, for instance, a shopkeeper who realizes he is losing exchange opportunities because of his dishonest behavior may begin to act as if he were a kind and honest man in order to garner more business. He is persuaded to behave in an appropriate way, yet his actions may be insincere. While it is socially beneficial that he at least pretends to behave in this way, he may not actually become more virtuous. However, in order to maintain this status in his community and succeed in his business long term, he must continue to behave in this manner. Over time, it is likely that his once intentional actions will become instinctive and more genuine, and eventually result in actual moral development. Stated another way, a truly dishonest and conniving person is unlikely to convincingly pretend to be reputable for an extended period of time without being impacted by some sort of moral development.",
		"Despite numerous studies on the influence of mediated agendas on politics, most studies examine text only⎯as if media only deliver words. These studies looked at how reporters, analysts, and commentators verbally describe and criticize the candidates. But they often neglect another important source of influence: visuals. As some communication scholars said, “Stories are often complex combinations of visual and verbal content⎯all too often the visual information is so powerful that it overwhelms the verbal.” The challenge of tackling visuals to examine their influence is multifaceted. The difficulties of gathering and coding visual data and of attributing impact to specific parts of images have no doubt caused veritable scholars to shy away. But the potential impact of visuals on people’s perceptions is simply too important to ignore. Furthermore, the importance of understanding both visuals and text in tandem cannot be understated.",
		"The way reduced prices are written during a sale will greatly affect people’s attitude toward the products (and their likelihood of purchasing them). If the sale prices are easy to understand using percentages (for example, “-50%”) or with the new prices already calculated (for example, “now only $20”), shoppers will react in an automatic and positive fashion. However, if it is necessary for them to do complex mental calculations (for example, if a $27.50 product is advertised at 12% off), they will switch to a more analytical style of thinking. This results in more attention spent on the calculation, and subsequently on the merits of the product. No longer feeling spontaneous, shoppers will start questioning whether it is actually a good deal or not, whether they really need another pair of shoes, etc. The more cognitive effort is demanded from shoppers, the more of a negative and suspicious reaction will be evoked, and the chances of making a sale diminish.",
		"Contractors that will construct a project may place more weight on the planning process. Proper planning forces detailed thinking about the project. It allows the project manager (or team) to “build the project in his or her head.” The project manager (or team) can consider different methodologies thereby deciding what works best or what does not work at all. This detailed thinking may be the only way to discover restrictions or risks that were not addressed in the estimating process. It would be far better to discover in the planning phase that a particular technology or material will not work than in the execution process. The goal of the planning process for the contractor is to produce a workable scheme that uses the resources efficiently within the allowable time and given budget. A well-developed plan does not guarantee that the executing process will proceed flawlessly or that the project will even succeed in meeting its objectives. It does, however, greatly improve its chances.",
		"The immense improvement in the yield of farming during the twentieth century, as a result of innovations in mechanization, fertilizer, new varieties, pesticides and genetic engineering, has banished famine from the face of the planet almost entirely, and drastically reduced malnutrition, even while the human population has continued to expand. Few predicted this, yet many are concerned that this improvement has come at the expense of nature. In fact the evidence is strong that the opposite is the case. Innovation in food production has spared land and forest from the plough, the cow and the axe on a grand scale by increasing the productivity of the land we do farm. It turns out that this ‘land sparing’ has been much better for biodiversity than land sharing would have been―by which is meant growing crops at low yields in the hope that abundant wildlife lives in fields alongside crops.",
		"Historically, the professions and society have engaged in a negotiating process intended to define the terms of their relationship. At the heart of this process is the tension between the professions’ pursuit of autonomy and the public’s demand for accountability. Society’s granting of power and privilege to the professions is premised on their willingness and ability to contribute to social well-being and to conduct their affairs in a manner consistent with broader social values. It has long been recognized that the expertise and privileged position of professionals confer authority and power that could readily be used to advance their own interests at the expense of those they serve. As Edmund Burke observed two centuries ago, “Men are qualified for civil liberty in exact proportion to their disposition to put moral chains upon their own appetites.” Autonomy has never been a one-way street and is never granted absolutely and irreversibly.",
		"A visual scene can set up our emotional response. Suspense is driven by a sense of calm with the anticipation of impending terror. Indeed, anticipation or expectations play a key role in driving our emotions. The Russian silent filmmaker Lev Kuleshov considered such contextual influences. He interspersed shots of an actor exhibiting a neutral expression with shots of a child’s coffin or a plate of soup. This same “neutral” expression was interpreted differently depending on what image preceded it. Thus, the same expression appeared to show sorrow or hunger, depending on the context. Psychological studies of the Kuleshov effect have confirmed the impact of the social context on emotion. For example, if a person smiles at you and then the smile turns into a neutral expression, that person will appear somewhat grumpy or disappointed. Conversely, if a person first looks angry and then the expression turns into a neutral expression, the person looks somewhat pleasant or positive.",
		"Just imagine that we have invented special glasses that give us the power to see the odorous world the way that other organisms perceive it. Put your pair on and walk outside for just a moment. As the bright sunlight hits our eyes, we would encounter a world far different from what we would normally expect. The air is full of molecules carried by breezes. Chemical signals would flood our eyes just as surely as sounds overwhelm our ears at a cocktail party. Stare at any plant and you would see compounds being released into the air from leaves, bark, and roots. A squirrel in a tree exudes carbon dioxide and other compounds with each breath. Glance along its brown body and notice that specific points (scent glands) appear to be slowly releasing chemical signals. If we could translate these signals into language, we would see phrases, sentences, statements, songs, and other messages waiting to be intercepted and interpreted.",
		"To overcome death as the obstacle that was hindering the evolution of human intelligence, our ancestors developed the killer app that propelled our species forward, ahead of all others: namely, spoken and written language in words and maths. I believe communication was, and still is, our most valuable invention. It has helped us preserve the knowledge, learning, discoveries and intelligence we have gained and pass them on from person to person and from generation to generation. Imagine if Einstein had had no way of telling the rest of us about his remarkable understanding of the theory of relativity. In the absence of our incredible abilities to communicate, each and every one of us would need to discover relativity on his or her own. Leaps of human intelligence have happened, then, as a response to the way human society and culture developed. A lot of our intelligence resulted from our interaction with each other, and not just in response to our environments.",
		"Often overlooked, but just as important a stakeholder, is the consumer who plays a large role in the notion of the privacy paradox. Consumer engagement levels in all manner of digital experiences and communities have simply exploded―and they show little or no signs of slowing. There is an awareness among consumers, not only that their personal data helps to drive the rich experiences that these companies provide, but also that sharing this data is the price you pay for these experiences, in whole or in part. Without a better understanding of the what, when, and why of data collection and use, the consumer is often left feeling vulnerable and conflicted. “I love this restaurant-finder app on my phone, but what happens to my data if I press ‘ok’ when asked if that app can use my current location?” Armed with tools that can provide them options, the consumer moves from passive bystander to active participant.",
		"Giving honest information may be particularly relevant to integrity because honesty is so fundamental in discussions of trustworthiness. Unfortunately, leaders are often reluctant to tell the truth. During times of crisis and change, business leaders are often faced with the challenge of either telling an uncomfortable truth, remaining silent, or downplaying the severity of the situation. There are plenty of other situations in which, in the short term, it may be more comfortable not to tell the truth to followers. Ultimately, however, even dishonesty that was meant to protect employee morale will eventually be exposed, undermining trustworthiness at a time when commitment to the organization is most vital. Even concerted efforts at secrecy can backfire, as employees may simply “fill in the gaps” in their understanding with their own theories about the leader’s behavior. Therefore, leaders need to take steps to explain the true reasons for their decisions to those individuals affected by it, leaving less room for negative interpretations of leader behavior.",
		"Historically, drafters of tax legislation are attentive to questions of economics and history, and less attentive to moral questions. Questions of morality are often pushed to the side in legislative debate, labeled too controversial, too difficult to answer, or, worst of all, irrelevant to the project. But, in fact, the moral questions of taxation are at the very heart of the creation of tax laws. Rather than irrelevant, moral questions are fundamental to the imposition of tax. Tax is the application of a society’s theories of distributive justice. Economics can go a long way towards helping a legislature determine whether or not a particular tax law will help achieve a particular goal, but economics cannot, in a vacuum, identify the goal. Creating tax policy requires identifying a moral goal, which is a task that must involve ethics and moral analysis.",
		"Many people say that we should take full advantage of the privileges of the Internet by forever learning more and more. They see no limit to how much information a person ought to consume and never acknowledge the emotional and psychological cost of cramming facts into our brains. If we aren’t using the wealth of available data to make ourselves more productive and useful to society, what’s the point of having it? While access to information is a privilege, it’s also a burden. This is especially true when we treat being well‑read as an obligation that can’t be escaped. Constant exposure to upsetting news can be traumatic. An unending flood of information makes it hard to pause and reflect on anything you’ve learned. At some point, even the most voracious of readers needs to pull the plug and stop the constant drip of facts, figures, and meaningless Internet fights. We’re living in an era of information overload─and the solution is not to learn more but to step back and consume a smaller amount of data in a more meaningful way.",
		"When you experience affect without knowing the cause, you are more likely to treat affect as information about the world, rather than your experience of the world. The psychologist Gerald L. Clore has spent decades performing clever experiments to better understand how people make decisions every day based on gut feelings. This phenomenon is called affective realism, because we experience supposed facts about the world that are created in part by our feelings. For example, people report more happiness and life satisfaction on sunny days, but only when they are not explicitly asked about the weather. When you apply for a job or college or medical school, make sure you interview on a sunny day, because interviewers tend to rate applicants more negatively when it is rainy. And the next time a good friend snaps at you, remember affective realism. Maybe your friend is irritated with you, but perhaps she didn’t sleep well last night, or maybe it’s just lunchtime. The change in her body budget, which she’s experiencing as affect, might not have anything to do with you.",
		"We can imagine natural numbers as whole objects, things our hunter-gatherer brains can work with. On the other hand, partial numbers―decimals, fractions, percentages, and ratios ―simply don’t register as real to our minds. We may be able to work with them for a given time when we’re in math mode, but if we’re asked questions at other times, we tend to have trouble grasping the concept. In other words, any time we give our audience figures that aren’t natural numbers, the message is unlikely to make sense to them. Not only are they prone to make errors remembering and calculating the numbers, but there’s a good chance they never even envision what we’re describing in the first place―because the number attached isn’t solid. Use natural numbers whenever you can to make your message real. For numbers less than 1, you can use a strategy to make things start to show up as natural numbers. If you find that 0.2% of people have a certain trait, using “1 out of 500” makes this abstract percentage into a real thing.",
		"When it comes to the Internet, it just pays to be a little paranoid (but not a lot). Given the level of anonymity with all that resides on the Internet, it’s sensible to question the validity of any data that you may receive. Typically it’s to our natural instinct when we meet someone coming down a sidewalk to place yourself in some manner of protective position, especially when they introduce themselves as having known you, much to your surprise. By design, we set up challenges in which the individual must validate how they know us by presenting scenarios, names or acquaintances, or evidence by which to validate (that is, photographs). Once we have received that information and it has gone through a cognitive validation, we accept that person as more trustworthy. All this happens in a matter of minutes but is a natural defense mechanism that we perform in the real world. However, in the virtual world, we have a tendency to be less defensive, as there appears to be no physical threat to our well-being.",
		"In order to be successful and equitable, ecosystem management must be linked to poverty reduction. Urban infrastructure projects need to address the trade­offs between conservation, livelihoods, and equitable distribution of resources. Historically there has been tension when conservation models that create protected areas are perceived as inaccessible to communities. Often, these models are implemented at the expense of poor and marginalized residents and users of resources from the areas. Social, economic, and environmental development programs have become obstacles to sustainable development because there is no balance between the need to protect ecosystem services and the desire to use resources to address community needs. Communities need to be allowed to identify and negotiate their own options and to increase their flexibility to cope with unexpected change.",
		"The need to assimilate values and lifestyle of the host culture has become a growing conflict. Multiculturalists suggest that there should be a model of partial assimilation in which immigrants retain some of their customs, beliefs, and language. There is pressure to conform rather than to maintain their cultural identities, however, and these conflicts are greatly determined by the community to which one migrates. These experiences are not new; many Europeans experienced exclusion and poverty during the first two waves of immigration in the 19th and 20th centuries. Eventually, these immigrants transformed this country with significant changes that included enlightenment and acceptance of diversity. People of color, however, continue to struggle for acceptance. Once again, the challenge is to recognize that other cultures think and act differently and that they have the right to do so. Perhaps, in the not too distant future, immigrants will no longer be strangers among us.",
		"Imagine a movie where nothing but terrible things happen. But, in the end, everything works out. Everything is resolved. A sufficiently happy ending can change the meaning of all the previous events. They can all be viewed as worthwhile, given that ending. Now imagine another movie. A lot of things are happening. They’re all exciting and interesting. But there are a lot of them. Ninety minutes in, you start to worry. “This is a great movie,” you think, “but there are a lot of things going on. I sure hope the filmmaker can pull it all together.” But that doesn’t happen. Instead, the story ends, suddenly, unresolved, or something facile and clichéd occurs. You leave deeply annoyed and unsatisfied— failing to notice that you were fully engaged and enjoying the movie almost the whole time you were in the theatre. The present can change the past, and the future can change the present.",
		"Though it may seem extreme, a multilingual can quite literally feel differently about people, events or things when using one language versus another. The likelihood of being rattled by curse words or taboo words changes across native and second languages. Speakers of multiple languages not only report feeling different, but their bodies have different physiological reactions and their minds make different emotionally driven decisions across languages. The exact relationship between positive and negative emotions and language varies across people. For some, the second language carries more positive connotations because it is associated with freedom, opportunity, financial well­being and escape from persecution, whereas the native language is associated with poverty and hardship. For others, the opposite is true―the second language is associated with post­immigration challenges, discrimination and lack of close relationships, whereas the native language is associated with family, friends and parental love. And many are somewhere in between, having a mix of positive and negative experiences associated with each language.",
		"One difference between winners and losers is how they handle losing. Even for the best companies and most accomplished professionals, long track records of success are punctuated by slips, slides, and mini-turnarounds. Even the team that wins the game might make mistakes and lag behind for part of it. That’s why the ability to recover quickly is so important. Troubles are ubiquitous. Surprises can fall from the sky like volcanic ash and appear to change everything. That’s why one prominent scholar said, “Anything can look like a failure in the middle.” Thus, a key factor in high achievement is bouncing back from the low points.",
		"The negative effects of extrinsic motivators such as grades have been documented with students from different cultures. Although this matter is more complex than simply regarding all extrinsic rewards as controlling or diminishing learning, we agree with Richard Ryan and his colleagues that people across different cultures are likely to express more satisfaction with their lives when their primary goals are intrinsic rather than extrinsic. Another consistent research finding is that when a learning activity is undertaken explicitly to attain some extrinsic reward, people respond by seeking the least demanding way of ensuring the reward. Since there are three decades of evidence that dominating instruction with a system of controlling external rewards may contribute to inferior learning, using a pedagogy based on theories of intrinsic motivation appears to be a more reasonable and effective approach to enhancing learning among culturally diverse students.",
		"Many present efforts to guard and maintain human progress, to meet human needs, and to realize human ambitions are simply unsustainable─in both the rich and poor nations. They draw too heavily, too quickly, on already overdrawn environmental resource accounts to be affordable far into the future without bankrupting those accounts. They may show profit on the balance sheets of our generation, but our children will inherit the losses. We borrow environmental capital from future generations with no intention or prospect of repaying. They may blame us for our wasteful ways, but they can never collect on our debt to them. We act as we do because we can get away with it: future generations do not vote; they have no political or financial power; they cannot challenge our decisions.",
		"One exercise in teamwork I do at a company retreat is to put the group in a circle. At one particular retreat, there were eight people in the circle, and I slowly handed tennis balls to one person to start throwing around the circle. If N equals the number of people in the circle, then the maximum number of balls you can have in motion is N minus 1. Why? Because it’s almost impossible to throw and catch at the same time. The purpose of the exercise is to demonstrate the importance of an individual’s action. People are much more concerned about catching the ball than throwing it. What this demonstrates is that it’s equally important to the success of the exercise that the person you’re throwing to catches the ball as that you are able to catch the ball. If you’re less concerned about how you deliver information than with how you receive it, you’ll ultimately fail at delegation. You have to be equally skilled at both.",
		"With the industrial society evolving into an information-based society, the concept of information as a product, a commodity with its own value, has emerged. As a consequence, those people, organizations, and countries that possess the highest-quality information are likely to prosper economically, socially, and politically. Investigations into the economics of information encompass a variety of categories including the costs of information and information services; the effects of information on decision making; the savings from effective information acquisition; the effects of information on productivity; and the effects of specific agencies (such as corporate, technical, or medical libraries) on the productivity of organizations. Obviously many of these areas overlap, but it is clear that information has taken on a life of its own outside the medium in which it is contained. Information has become a recognized entity to be measured, evaluated, and priced.",
		"In retrospect, it might seem surprising that something as mundane as the desire to count sheep was the driving force for an advance as fundamental as written language. But the desire for written records has always accompanied economic activity, since transactions are meaningless unless you can clearly keep track of who owns what. As such, early human writing is dominated by wheeling and dealing: a collection of bets, bills, and contracts. Long before we had the writings of the prophets, we had the writings of the profits. In fact, many civilizations never got to the stage of recording and leaving behind the kinds of great literary works that we often associate with the history of culture. What survives these ancient societies is, for the most part, a pile of receipts. If it weren’t for the commercial enterprises that produced those records, we would know far, far less about the cultures that they came from.",
		"Prior to file-sharing services, music albums landed exclusively in the hands of music critics before their release. These critics would listen to them well before the general public could and preview them for the rest of the world in their reviews. Once the internet made music easily accessible and allowed even advanced releases to spread through online social networks, availability of new music became democratized, which meant critics no longer had unique access. That is, critics and laypeople alike could obtain new music simultaneously. Social media services also enabled people to publicize their views on new songs, list their new favorite bands in their social media bios, and argue over new music endlessly on message boards. The result was that critics now could access the opinions of the masses on a particular album before writing their reviews. Thus, instead of music reviews guiding popular opinion toward art (as they did in preinternet times), music reviews began to reflect―consciously or subconsciously―public opinion.",
		"Environmental hazards include biological, physical, and chemical ones, along with the human behaviors that promote or allow exposure. Some environmental contaminants are difficult to avoid (the breathing of polluted air, the drinking of chemically contaminated public drinking water, noise in open public spaces); in these circumstances, exposure is largely involuntary. Reduction or elimination of these factors may require societal action, such as public awareness and public health measures. In many countries, the fact that some environmental hazards are difficult to avoid at the individual level is felt to be more morally egregious than those hazards that can be avoided. Having no choice but to drink water contaminated with very high levels of arsenic, or being forced to passively breathe in tobacco smoke in restaurants, outrages people more than the personal choice of whether an individual smokes tobacco. These factors are important when one considers how change (risk reduction) happens.",
		"Urban delivery vehicles can be adapted to better suit the density of urban distribution, which often involves smaller vehicles such as vans, including bicycles. The latter have the potential to become a preferred ‘last-mile’ vehicle, particularly in high-density and congested areas. In locations where bicycle use is high, such as the Netherlands, delivery bicycles are also used to carry personal cargo (e.g. groceries). Due to their low acquisition and maintenance costs, cargo bicycles convey much potential in developed and developing countries alike, such as the becak (a three-wheeled bicycle) in Indonesia. Services using electrically assisted delivery tricycles have been successfully implemented in France and are gradually being adopted across Europe for services as varied as parcel and catering deliveries. Using bicycles as cargo vehicles is particularly encouraged when combined with policies that restrict motor vehicle access to specific areas of a city, such as downtown or commercial districts, or with the extension of dedicated bike lanes.",
		"Being able to prioritize your responses allows you to connect more deeply with individual customers, be it a one-off interaction around a particularly delightful or upsetting experience, or the development of a longer-term relationship with a significantly influential individual within your customer base. If you’ve ever posted a favorable comment―or any comment, for that matter―about a brand, product or service, think about what it would feel like if you were personally acknowledged by the brand manager, for example, as a result. In general, people post because they have something to say―and because they want to be recognized for having said it. In particular, when people post positive comments they are expressions of appreciation for the experience that led to the post. While a compliment to the person standing next to you is typically answered with a response like “Thank You,” the sad fact is that most brand compliments go unanswered. These are lost opportunities to understand what drove the compliments and create a solid fan based on them.",
		"Many of the first models of cultural evolution drew noticeable connections between culture and genes by using concepts from theoretical population genetics and applying them to culture. Cultural patterns of transmission, innovation, and selection are conceptually likened to genetic processes of transmission, mutation, and selection. However, these approaches had to be modified to account for the differences between genetic and cultural transmission. For example, we do not expect the cultural transmission to follow the rules of genetic transmission strictly. If two biological parents have different forms of a cultural trait, their child is not necessarily equally likely to acquire the mother’s or father’s form of that trait. Further, a child can acquire cultural traits not only from its parents but also from nonparental adults and peers; thus, the frequency of a cultural trait in the population is relevant beyond just the probability that an individual’s parents had that trait.",
		"Most people think their conscious minds control everything they do. They generally believe the conscious mind constantly directs their actions. These beliefs are false. Consider walking, for example, which is something that most people do over and over all day long. Do you consciously control the movements of your legs and feet? Does your conscious mind have to say, “Now pick up the left foot, swing it forward, hold it high enough so it doesn’t touch the ground, set down the heel, roll forward, shift weight off the back foot,” and so on? Of course not. Most of the time, walking is done without conscious thoughts or intentions.",
		"Three psychology professors at Newcastle University conducted an experiment in their department’s coffee area. Colleagues and students were able to help themselves to coffee and were asked in return to leave fifty cents for coffee. For ten weeks, the professors alternated two posters-one of flowers and one of staring eyes-over the area. On the weeks the eyes were watching them, people contributed 2.76 times more money than they did when the flower poster was up. In a similar study set on Halloween, mirrors were placed outside a house. Children were told to take only one piece of candy so that there would be plenty for everyone. When the mirrors reflected their images back at them, most children took only one piece of candy.",
		"The human voice can form incredibly different sounds, but each individual language contains only a subset of potential sound units, or phonemes. One phoneme that occurs in only about twenty percent of the world’s languages is the ejective consonant, such as [p] or [k]. Caleb Everett, an anthropologist, decided to map where this sound occurs. He took a sample of 567 languages spoken around the world and compared the locations and altitudes of those that either contained or ignored ejective consonants. Everett discovered that languages that included ejective consonants were generally spoken at a higher elevation than those that did not. He suggests that the sounds are more popular at high altitudes because lower air pressure may make it easier to produce the burst of air that is a key characteristic of ejective consonants.",
		"In a study, 211 women signed up for a sixteen-week weight-loss program. All participants were randomly separated into three groups: long-term public commitment, short-term public commitment, and no public commitment. Those in the long-term group wrote their names and weight-loss goals on index cards that were publicly displayed in the fitness center for the full sixteen weeks of the program. Those in the short-term group did the same, but the cards were displayed for only the first three weeks. Those in the no-public-commitment group did not fill out cards. At the conclusion of the study, the effect of long-term public commitment was evident. At the sixteen-week mark, the long-term group had, on average, exceeded their goals by about 102%, while the short-term group achieved an average of 96% success and the no-commitment group reached only 88%.",
		"Natural boundaries between states or countries are found along rivers, lakes, deserts, and mountain ranges. Among them, river boundaries would seem to be ideal: they provide clear separation, and they are established and recognized physical features. In reality, however, river boundaries can change as rivers change course. Following flooding, a river’s course may shift, altering the boundary between states or countries. For example, the Rio Grande, separating the United States and Mexico, has frequently shifted its course, causing problems in determining the exact location of the international boundary.",
		"We must be careful when looking at proverbs as expressing aspects of a certain worldview or mentality of a people. That is, no fixed conclusions about a so-called “national character” should be drawn. There are so many popular proverbs from classical, Biblical, and medieval times current in various cultures that it would be foolish to think of them as showing some imagined national character. Nevertheless, the frequent use of certain proverbs in a particular culture could be used together with other social and cultural indicators to form some common concepts. Thus, if the Germans really do use the proverb, “Morgenstunde hat Gold im Munde” (The morning hour has gold in its mouth) with high frequency, then it does mirror at least to some degree the German attitude towards getting up early.",
		"As part of a research project, a group of undergraduate students watched a film, after which they were asked to describe it as fully as possible to other students. The listeners were actually research assistants, and for half the participants they assumed a positive listening style (smiling and nodding); for the other participants they assumed a negative listening style (frowning and unsmiling). Participants describing the film to positive listeners included more of their own opinions about what the film was trying to say. In contrast, participants speaking to negative listeners focused solely on objective facts and concrete details. The theory is that the smiles and nods of a listener signal interest and agreement, which in turn encourage the speaker to share more personal insights. Negative body language triggers a threat response that causes the speaker to pull back into the relative “safety” of facts.",
		"Do animals have a sense of fairness? Researchers decided to test this by paying dogs for “giving their paw.” Dogs were asked repeatedly to give their paw. Researchers measured how fast and how many times dogs would give their paw if they were not rewarded. Once this baseline level of paw giving was established, the researchers had two dogs sit next to each other and asked each dog in turn to give a paw. Then one of the dogs was given a better reward than the other. In response, the dog that was being “paid” less for the same work began giving its paw more reluctantly and stopped giving its paw sooner. This finding raises the very interesting possibility that dogs may have a basic sense of fairness, or at least a hatred of inequality.",
		"Children are much more resistant to giving something to someone else than to helping them. One can observe this difference clearly in very young children. Even though one­and­a­half­year­olds will support each other in difficult situations, they are not willing to share their own toys with others. The little ones even defend their possessions with screams and, if necessary, blows. This is the daily experience of parents troubled by constant quarreling between toddlers. There was no word I heard more frequently than “Mine!” from my daughters when they were still in diapers.",
		"In one study, researchers asked students to arrange ten posters in order of beauty. They promised that afterward the students could have one of the ten posters as a reward for their participation. However, when the students finished the task, the researchers said that the students were not allowed to keep the poster that they had rated as the third­most beautiful. Then, they asked the students to judge all ten posters again from the very beginning. What happened was that the poster they were unable to keep was suddenly ranked as the most beautiful. This is an example of the “Romeo and Juliet effect”: Just like Romeo and Juliet in the Shakespearean tragedy, people become more attached to each other when their love is prohibited.",
		"Timothy Wilson did an experiment in which he gave students a choice of five different art posters, and then later surveyed to see if they still liked their choices. People who were told to consciously examine their choices were least happy with their posters weeks later. People who looked at the poster briefly and then chose later were happiest. Another researcher then replicated the results in the real world with a study set in a furniture store. Furniture selection is one of the most cognitively demanding choices any consumer makes. The people who had made their selections of a study set after less conscious examination were happier than those who made their purchase after a lot of careful examination.",
		"Recent experimental evidence for the importance of reputation in facilitating cooperation has come from an analysis of the contributions to an ‘honesty box’ for drinks in a university departmental coffee room. Bateson and colleagues looked at contributions to the box when images (always posted above the recommended price list) of a pair of eyes were alternated on a weekly basis with images of flowers. The amount of milk consumed turned out to be the best indicator of total consumption, but remarkably almost three times more money was paid per liter in weeks when there were eyes portrayed, compared to when there were flowers portrayed. Of course this experiment was only conducted in one location, but the effect size is impressive and it seems to indicate that individuals do not want to be observed cheating the system.",
		"A large American hardware manufacturer was invited to introduce its products to a distributor with good reputation in Germany. Wanting to make the best possible impression, the American company sent its most promising young executive, Fred Wagner, who spoke fluent German. When Fred first met his German hosts, he shook hands firmly, greeted everyone in German, and even remembered to bow the head slightly as is the German custom. Fred, a very effective public speaker, began his presentation with a few humorous jokes to set a relaxed atmosphere. However, he felt that his presentation was not very well received by the German executives. Even though Fred thought he had done his cultural homework, he made one particular error. Fred did not win any points by telling a few jokes. It was viewed as too informal and unprofessional in a German business setting.",
		"According to an Australian study, a person’s confidence in the kitchen is linked to the kind of food that he or she tends to enjoy eating. Compared to the average person, those who are proud of the dishes they make are more likely to enjoy eating vegetarian food and health food. Moreover, this group is more likely than the average person to enjoy eating diverse kinds of food: from salads and seafood to hamburgers and hot chips. In contrast, people who say “I would rather clean than make dishes.” don’t share this wide-ranging enthusiasm for food. They are less likely than the average person to enjoy different types of food. In general, they eat out less than the average person except for when it comes to eating at fast food restaurants.",
		"Social psychologists at the University of Virginia asked college students to stand at the base of a hill while carrying a weighted backpack and estimate the steepness of the hill. Some participants stood next to close friends whom they had known a long time, some stood next to friends they had not known for long, some stood next to strangers, and the others stood alone during the exercise. The participants who stood with close friends gave significantly lower estimates of the steepness of the hill than those who stood alone, next to strangers, or next to newly formed friends. Furthermore, the longer the close friends had known each other, the less steep the hill appeared to the participants involved in the study.",
		"If you want to modify people’s behavior, is it better to highlight the benefits of changing or the costs of not changing? According to Peter Salovey, one of the originators of the concept of emotional intelligence, it depends on whether they perceive the new behavior as safe or risky. If they think the behavior is safe, we should emphasize all the good things that will happen if they do it―they’ll want to act immediately to obtain those certain gains. But when people believe a behavior is risky, that approach doesn’t work. They’re already comfortable with the status quo, so the benefits of change aren’t attractive, and the stop system kicks in. Instead, we need to destabilize the status quo and emphasize the bad things that will happen if they don’t change. Taking a risk is more appealing when they’re faced with a guaranteed loss if they don’t. The prospect of a certain loss brings the go system online.",
		"Crows are a remarkably clever family of birds. They are capable of solving many more complex problems compared to other birds, such as chickens. After hatching, chickens peck busily for their own food much faster than crows, which rely on the parent bird to bring them food in the nest. However, as adults, chickens have very limited hunting skills whereas crows are much more flexible in hunting for food. Crows also end up with bigger and more complex brains. Their extended period between hatching and flight from the nest enables them to develop intelligence.",
		"Recent studies point to the importance of warm physical contact for healthy relationships with others. In one study, participants who briefly held a cup of hot (versus iced) coffee judged a target person as having a “warmer” personality (generous, caring); in another study, participants holding a hot (versus cold) pack were more likely to choose a gift for a friend instead of something for themselves. These findings illustrate that mere contact experiences of physical warmth activate feelings of interpersonal warmth. Moreover, this temporarily increased activation of interpersonal warmth feelings then influences judgments toward other people in an unintentional manner. Such feelings activated in one context last for a while thereafter and have influence on judgment and behavior in later contexts without the person’s awareness.",
		"At the Leipzig Zoo in Germany, 34 zoo chimpanzees and orangutans participating in a study were each individually tested in a room, where they were put in front of two boxes. An experimenter would place an object inside one box and leave the room. Another experimenter would enter the room, move the object into the other box and exit. When the first experimenter returned and tried retrieving the object from the first box, the great ape would help the experimenter open the second box, which it knew the object had been transferred to. However, most apes in the study did not help the first experimenter open the second box if the first experimenter was still in the room to see the second experimenter move the item. The findings show the great apes understood when the first experimenter still thought the item was where he or she last left it.",
		"We cannot predict the outcomes of sporting contests, which vary from week to week. This heterogeneity is a feature of sport. It is the uncertainty of the result and the quality of the contest that consumers find attractive. For the sport marketer, this is problematic, as the quality of the contest cannot be guaranteed, no promises can be made in relations to the result and no assurances can be given in respect of the performance of star players. Unlike consumer products, sport cannot and does not display consistency as a key feature of marketing strategies. The sport marketer therefore must avoid marketing strategies based solely on winning, and must instead focus on developing product extensions such as the facility, parking, merchandise, souvenirs, food and beverages rather than on the core product (that is, the game itself).",
		"In one experiment, subjects observed a person solve 30 multiple­choice problems. In all cases, 15 of the problems were solved correctly. One group of subjects saw the person solve more problems correctly in the first half and another group saw the person solve more problems correctly in the second half. The group that saw the person perform better on the initial examples rated the person as more intelligent and recalled that he had solved more problems correctly. The explanation for the difference is that one group formed the opinion that the person was intelligent on the initial set of data, while the other group formed the opposite opinion. Once this opinion is formed, when opposing evidence is presented it can be discounted by attributing later performance to some other cause such as chance or problem difficulty.",
		"What really works to motivate people to achieve their goals? In one study, researchers looked at how people respond to life challenges including getting a job, taking an exam, or undergoing surgery. For each of these conditions, the researchers also measured how much these participants fantasized about positive outcomes and how much they actually expected a positive outcome. What’s the difference really between fantasy and expectation? While fantasy involves imagining an idealized future, expectation is actually based on a person’s past experiences. So what did the researchers find? The results revealed that those who had engaged in fantasizing about the desired future did worse in all three conditions. Those who had more positive expectations for success did better in the following weeks, months, and years. These individuals were more likely to have found jobs, passed their exams, or successfully recovered from their surgery.",
		"In a study, psychologist Laurence Steinberg of Temple University and his co­author, psychologist Margo Gardner divided 306 people into three age groups: young adolescents, with a mean age of 14; older adolescents, with a mean age of 19; and adults, aged 24 and older. Subjects played a computerized driving game in which the player must avoid crashing into a wall that appears, without warning, on the roadway. Steinberg and Gardner randomly assigned some participants to play alone or with two same­age peers looking on. Older adolescents scored about 50 percent higher on an index of risky driving when their peers were in the room―and the driving of early adolescents was fully twice as reckless when other young teens were around. In contrast, adults behaved in similar ways regardless of whether they were on their own or observed by others.",
		"The perception of the same amount of discount on a product depends on its relation to the initial price. In one study, respondents were presented with a purchase situation. The persons put in the situation of buying a calculator that cost $15 found out from the vendor that the same product was available in a different store 20 minutes away and at a promotional price of $10. In this case, 68% of respondents decided to make their way down to the store in order to save $5. In the second condition, which involved buying a jacket for $125, the respondents were also told that the same product was available in a store 20 minutes away and cost $120 there. This time, only 29% of the persons said that they would get the cheaper jacket. In both cases, the product was $5 cheaper, but in the first case, the amount was 1/3 of the price, and in the second, it was 1/25 of the price. What differed in both of these situations was the price context of the purchase.",
		"While there are many evolutionary or cultural reasons for cooperation, the eyes are one of the most important means of cooperation, and eye contact may be the most powerful human force we lose in traffic. It is, arguably, the reason why humans, normally a quite cooperative species, can become so noncooperative on the road. Most of the time we are moving too fast—we begin to lose the ability to keep eye contact around 20 miles per hour —or it is not safe to look. Maybe our view is blocked. Often other drivers are wearing sunglasses, or their car may have tinted windows. (And do you really want to make eye contact with those drivers?) Sometimes we make eye contact through the rearview mirror, but it feels weak, not quite believable at first, as it is not “face­to­face.”",
		"Have you noticed that some coaches get the most out of their athletes while others don’t? A poor coach will tell you what you did wrong and then tell you not to do it again: “Don’t drop the ball!” What happens next? The images you see in your head are images of you dropping the ball! Naturally, your mind recreates what it just “saw” based on what it’s been told. Not surprisingly, you walk on the court and drop the ball. What does the good coach do? He or she points out what could be improved, but will then tell you how you could or should perform: “I know you’ll catch the ball perfectly this time.” Sure enough, the next image in your mind is you catching the ball and scoring a goal. Once again, your mind makes your last thoughts part of reality—but this time, that “reality” is positive, not negative.",
		"One way that music could express emotion is simply through a learned association. Perhaps there is nothing naturally sad about a piece of music in a minor key, or played slowly with low notes. Maybe we have just come to hear certain kinds of music as sad because we have learned to associate them in our culture with sad events like funerals. If this view is correct, we should have difficulty interpreting the emotions expressed in culturally unfamiliar music. Totally opposed to this view is the position that the link between music and emotion is one of resemblance. For example, when we feel sad we move slowly and speak slowly and in a low­pitched voice. Thus when we hear slow, low music, we hear it as sad. If this view is correct, we should have little difficulty understanding the emotion expressed in culturally unfamiliar music.",
		"In their study in 2007 Katherine Kinzler and her colleagues at Harvard showed that our tendency to identify with an in-group to a large degree begins in infancy and may be innate. Kinzler and her team took a bunch of five-month-olds whose families only spoke English and showed the babies two videos. In one video, a woman was speaking English. In the other, a woman was speaking Spanish. Then they were shown a screen with both women side by side, not speaking. In infant psychology research, the standard measure for affinity or interest is attention― babies will apparently stare longer at the things they like more. In Kinzler’s study, the babies stared at the English speakers longer. In other studies, researchers have found that infants are more likely to take a toy offered by someone who speaks the same language as them. Psychologists routinely cite these and other experiments as evidence of our built-in evolutionary preference for “our own kind.”",
		"In one study, researchers asked pairs of strangers to sit down in a room and chat. In half of the rooms, a cell phone was placed on a nearby table; in the other half, no phone was present. After the conversations had ended, the researchers asked the participants what they thought of each other. Here’s what they learned: when a cell phone was present in the room, the participants reported the quality of their relationship was worse than those who’d talked in a cell phone­free room. The pairs who talked in the rooms with cell phones thought their partners showed less empathy. Think of all the times you’ve sat down to have lunch with a friend and set your phone on the table. You might have felt good about yourself because you didn’t pick it up to check your messages, but your unchecked messages were still hurting your connection with the person sitting across from you.",
		"A woman named Rhonda who attended the University of California at Berkeley had a problem. She was living near campus with several other people―none of whom knew one another. When the cleaning people came each weekend, they left several rolls of toilet paper in each of the two bathrooms. However, by Monday all the toilet paper would be gone. It was a classic tragedy­of­the­commons situation: because some people took more toilet paper than their fair share, the public resource was destroyed for everyone else. After reading a research paper about behavior change, Rhonda put a note in one of the bathrooms asking people not to remove the toilet paper, as it was a shared item. To her great satisfaction, one roll reappeared in a few hours, and another the next day. In the other note­free bathroom, however, there was no toilet paper until the following weekend, when the cleaning people returned.",
		"Nancy Lowry and David Johnson conducted an experiment to study a teaching environment where fifth and sixth graders were assigned to interact on a topic. With one group, the discussion was led in a way that built an agreement. With the second group, the discussion was designed to produce disagreements about the right answer. Students who easily reached an agreement were less interested in the topic, studied less, and were less likely to visit the library to get additional information. The most noticeable difference, though, was revealed when teachers showed a special film about the discussion topic—during lunch time! Only 18 percent of the agreement group missed lunch time to see the film, but 45 percent of the students from the disagreement group stayed for the film. The thirst to fill a knowledge gap— to find out who was right within the group—can be more powerful than the thirst for slides and jungle gyms.",
		"There is often a lot of uncertainty in the realm of science, which the general public finds uncomfortable. They don’t want “informed guesses,” they want certainties that make their lives easier, and science is often unequipped to meet these demands. In particular, the human body is fantastically complex, and some scientific answers can never be provided in black-or-white terms. All this is why the media tends to oversimplify scientific research when presenting it to the public. In their eyes, they’re just “giving people what they want” as opposed to offering more accurate but complex information that very few people will read or understand. A perfect example of this is how people want definitive answers as to which foods are “good” and “bad.” Scientifically speaking, there are no “good” and “bad” foods; rather, food quality exists on a continuum, meaning that some foods are better than others when it comes to general health and well-being.",
		"The common blackberry (Rubus allegheniensis) has an amazing ability to move manganese from one layer of soil to another using its roots. This may seem like a funny talent for a plant to have, but it all becomes clear when you realize the effect it has on nearby plants. Manganese can be very harmful to plants, especially at high concentrations. Common blackberry is unaffected by damaging effects of this metal and has evolved two different ways of using manganese to its advantage. First, it redistributes manganese from deeper soil layers to shallow soil layers using its roots as a small pipe. Second, it absorbs manganese as it grows, concentrating the metal in its leaves. When the leaves drop and decay, their concentrated manganese deposits further poison the soil around the plant. For plants that are not immune to the toxic effects of manganese, this is very bad news. Essentially, the common blackberry eliminates competition by poisoning its neighbors with heavy metals.",
		"According to a study of Swedish adolescents, an important factor of adolescents’ academic success is how they respond to challenges. The study reports that when facing difficulties, adolescents exposed to an authoritative parenting style are less likely to be passive, helpless, and afraid to fail. Another study of nine high schools in Wisconsin and northern California indicates that children of authoritative parents do well in school, because these parents put a lot of effort into getting involved in their children’s school activities. That is, authoritative parents are significantly more likely to help their children with homework, to attend school programs, to watch their children in sports, and to help students select courses. Moreover, these parents are more aware of what their children do and how they perform in school. Finally, authoritative parents praise academic excellence and the importance of working hard more than other parents do.",
		"My colleagues and I ran an experiment testing two different messages meant to convince thousands of resistant alumni to make a donation. One message emphasized the opportunity to do good: donating would benefit students, faculty, and staff. The other emphasized the opportunity to feel good: donors would enjoy the warm glow of giving. The two messages were equally effective: in both cases, 6.5 percent of the unwilling alumni ended up donating. Then we combined them, because two reasons are better than one. Except they weren’t. When we put the two reasons together, the giving rate dropped below 3 percent. Each reason alone was more than twice as effective as the two combined. The audience was already skeptical. When we gave them different kinds of reasons to donate, we triggered their awareness that someone was trying to persuade them―and they shielded themselves against it.",
		"One of the most powerful tools to find meaning in our lives is reflective journaling—thinking back on and writing about what has happened to us. In the 1990s, Stanford University researchers asked undergraduate students on spring break to journal about their most important personal values and their daily activities; others were asked to write about only the good things that happened to them in the day. Three weeks later, the students who had written about their values were happier, healthier, and more confident about their ability to handle stress than the ones who had only focused on the good stuff. By reflecting on how their daily activities supported their values, students had gained a new perspective on those activities and choices. Little stresses and hassles were now demonstrations of their values in action. Suddenly, their lives were full of meaningful activities. And all they had to do was reflect and write about it―positively reframing their experiences with their personal values.",
		"To help decide what’s risky and what’s safe, who’s trustworthy and who’s not, we look for social evidence. From an evolutionary view, following the group is almost always positive for our prospects of survival. “If everyone’s doing it, it must be a sensible thing to do,” explains famous psychologist and best selling writer of Influence, Robert Cialdini. While we can frequently see this today in product reviews, even subtler cues within the environment can signal trustworthiness. Consider this: when you visit a local restaurant, are they busy? Is there a line outside or is it easy to find a seat? It is a hassle to wait, but a line can be a powerful cue that the food’s tasty, and these seats are in demand. More often than not, it’s good to adopt the practices of those around you.",
		"Nearly eight of ten U.S. adults believe there are “good foods” and “bad foods.” Unless we’re talking about spoiled stew, poison mushrooms, or something similar, however, no foods can be labeled as either good or bad. There are, however, combinations of foods that add up to a healthful or unhealthful diet. Consider the case of an adult who eats only foods thought of as “good”―for example, raw broccoli, apples, orange juice, boiled tofu, and carrots. Although all these foods are nutrient­dense, they do not add up to a healthy diet because they don’t supply a wide enough variety of the nutrients we need. Or take the case of the teenager who occasionally eats fried chicken, but otherwise stays away from fried foods. The occasional fried chicken isn’t going to knock his or her diet off track. But the person who eats fried foods every day, with few vegetables or fruits, and loads up on supersized soft drinks, candy, and chips for snacks has a bad diet.",
		"It’s not news to anyone that we judge others based on their clothes. In general, studies that investigate these judgments find that people prefer clothing that matches expectations—surgeons in scrubs, little boys in blue—with one notable exception. A series of studies published in an article in June 2014 in the Journal of Consumer Research explored observers’ reactions to people who broke established norms only slightly. In one scenario, a man at a black­tie affair was viewed as having higher status and competence when wearing a red bow tie. The researchers also found that valuing uniqueness increased audience members’ ratings of the status and competence of a professor who wore red sneakers while giving a lecture. The results suggest that people judge these slight deviations from the norm as positive because they suggest that the individual is powerful enough to risk the social costs of such behaviors.",
		"The mind has parts that are known as the conscious mind and the subconscious mind. The subconscious mind is very fast to act and doesn’t deal with emotions. It deals with memories of your responses to life, your memories and recognition. However, the conscious mind is the one that you have more control over. You think. You can choose whether to carry on a thought or to add emotion to it and this is the part of your mind that lets you down frequently because—fueled by emotions—you make the wrong decisions time and time again. When your judgment is clouded by emotions, this puts in biases and all kinds of other negativities that hold you back. Scared of spiders? Scared of the dark? There are reasons for all of these fears, but they originate in the conscious mind. They only become real fears when the subconscious mind records your reactions.",
		"We often spend our childhood years testing our physical limits by doing all kinds of team sports. When we become high school students, we go so far as to engage in two or three team sports. That’s because we have enough physical strength. By the time we reach adulthood, however, very few of us can compete at the elite level, even though more than half of us still enjoy playing sports. That is, we’re finding we’re not as physically strong as we used to be. Naturally, we move away from team sports requiring collision, such as football, soccer, or basketball, and toward sports that offer less risk of physical injury or stress on the body. Actually, many people turn to sports for individuals. Thus, team sports become more difficult to organize in an adult world.",
		"The essence of a sense of time is the experience of things happening in a given sequence: that is, knowing that such and such a thing happened first, and then that happened. This basic experience of time is vital to the way we make sense of the world, as was entertainingly explored in a novel by Rob Grant about a world in which time runs backwards. For example, our understanding of the sequence determines how we see causal connection. In our world, St. Francis picked up injured birds, then he healed them and then he released them from his hand-a saintly action. In Grant’s backwards world the time sequence is reversed: healthy birds fly to Francis’ hands, then they are injured, and then he puts them down- a sequence of events that is more sadistic than saintly.",
		"Formal organizations such as multinational corporations train workers to perform their jobs in a certain way and reward them for good performance. When workers are trained to respond mindlessly to the dictates of the job, however, they risk developing trained incapacity-the inability to respond to new or unusual circumstances or to recognize when official rules or procedures do not apply or may be doing harm. In other words, workers are trained to do their jobs in an efficient way to meet organizational goals while ignoring other important matters related to their health, the community, and the environment. At the root of trained incapacity is a job with little variety and repetitive tasks. Economist Thorstein Veblen argues that as variety in work decreases, the amount of thought and time needed to perform a job also decreases.",
		"Participants in a laboratory study were asked to listen to a pair of very loud, unpleasant noises played through headphones. One noise lasted for eight seconds. The other lasted sixteen. The first eight seconds of the second noise were identical to the first noise, whereas the second eight seconds, while still loud and unpleasant, were not as loud. Later, the participants were told that they would have to listen to one of the noises again, but that they could choose which one. Clearly the second noise is worse—the unpleasantness lasted twice as long. Nevertheless, the overwhelming majority of people chose the second to be repeated. Why? Because whereas both noises were unpleasant and had the same irritating peak, the second had a less unpleasant end, and so was remembered as less annoying than the first.",
		"More than 40 years ago, psychologist Sibylle Escalona carried out what has become a classic study of the play behaviors of 128 infants and their mothers. Her major finding was that, even if the infants had a large variety of toys to play with, the sensorimotor play of babies playing alone was less sustained than that of babies who had an adult to interact with. The mothers seemed to be skilled social directors. They tended to adapt the play activities to the immediate needs of children by varying their own activities in response to what the children were doing. For example, mothers would vary the rate at which they offered new play materials and introduce variations or increase the intensity of play when the children seemed to be losing interest. As a result, the mothers were able to sustain their children’s interest in the various play activities and thereby increase the length of their attention spans.",
		"Sometimes children may want to do more than they are capable of doing. For example, the five­year­old son of a friend of ours went on a hike with his father. At one point the boy asked his father to let him carry a heavy backpack the way the “big people” do. Without saying a word, the father took his backpack off and handed it to his son, who immediately discovered that it was too heavy for him to carry. The boy simply exclaimed, “Dad, it’s too heavy for me.” He then went happily on his way up the trail. In a safe way the father had allowed his son to discover experientially that he was, indeed, too small. He had also avoided a potential argument with his son.",
		"In today’s marketing and advertising­soaked world, people cannot escape brands. The younger they are when they start using a brand or product, the more likely they are to keep using it for years to come. But that’s not the only reason companies are aiming their marketing and advertising at younger consumers. As James U. McNeal, a professor at Texas A&M University, puts it, 󰡒Seventy­five percent of spontaneous food purchases can be traced to a nagging child. And one out of two mothers will buy a food simply because her child requests it. To trigger desire in a child is to trigger desire in the whole family.󰡓 In other words, kids have power over spending in their households, they have power over their grandparents and they have power over their babysitters. That’s why companies use tricks to manipulate their minds.",
		"Research by Paul Slovic of Decision Research and the University of Oregon shows that people who are otherwise caring and would go out of their way to help another individual become indifferent to the suffering of the masses. In one experiment, people were given $5 to donate to lessen hunger overseas. The first choice was to give the money to a particular child, Rokia, a seven­year­old in Mali. The second choice was to help twenty­one million hungry Africans. The third choice was to help Rokia, but as just one of many victims of hunger. Can you guess which choice was most popular? Slovic reported that donations to the individual, Rokia, were far greater than donations to the second choice, the statistical portrayal of the hunger crisis. That’s not particularly surprising. But what is surprising, and some would say discouraging, is that adding the statistical realities of the larger hunger problem to Rokia’s story significantly reduced the contributions to Rokia.",
		"An experiment was conducted by Amos Tversky at Harvard Medical School in 1982. The physicians were asked to decide to recommend either surgery or radiation for their patients with lung cancer. Half of the physicians were told, “The one-month survival rate for surgery is 90%.” Given this information, 84% of the physicians chose to recommend surgery over radiation. The other physicians were provided with this information about surgery outcomes: “There is a 10% mortality rate in the first month.” Given this latter information, only 50% of the physicians recommended surgery. As you may have realized, the two statements describe the same outcome. However, when the same outcome statistics are framed in terms of ‘survival,’ substantially more physicians choose the surgery. But when the outcomes are framed in terms of ‘mortality,’ the percentage of physicians who choose surgery drops greatly. This effect has been demonstrated in politics, medicine, advertising, and all areas in which people make decisions.",
		"When I was in eighth grade, we were studying longitude and latitude in geography class. Every day for a week, we had a quiz, and I kept getting longitude and latitude confused. I went home and almost cried because I was so frustrated and embarrassed that I couldn’t keep them straight in my mind. I stared and stared at those words until suddenly I figured out what to do. I told myself, when you see that n in longitude it will remind you of the word north. Therefore, it will be easy to remember that longitude lines go from north to south. It worked; I got them all right on the next quiz, and the next, and on the test.",
		"You’d think that whenever more than one person makes a decision, they’d draw on collective wisdom. Surely, a group of minds can do better than an individual. Unfortunately, that’s not always the case. The wisdom of a crowd partly relies on the fact that all judgments are independent. If people guess the weight of a cow and put it on a slip of paper, or estimate the likelihood of a revolution in Pakistan and enter it into a website, the average of their views is highly accurate. But, surprisingly, if those people talk about these questions in a group, the answers that they come to are increasingly incorrect. More specifically, researchers have found an effect of group polarization. Whatever bias people may have as individuals gets multiplied when they discuss things as a group. If individuals lean slightly toward taking a risk, the group leaps toward it.",
		"Some companies provide their employees with cafeteria incentive programs. The term cafeteria is used because choices are similar to those in a cafeteria, in which a diner proceeds down the line and chooses those foods that he or she would like and leaves the others. Cafeteria incentives take a variety of forms. In many cases, the company will put aside a pool of money that each individual can spend on these options, such as $3,000 annually. Then, if one person has a family with two small children and wants to use some of this money for a child­care program, the costs are automatically deducted from that employee’s pool of money. Another individual might purchase additional life insurance or medical coverage to meet his or her specific needs. At Lincoln Electric, for example, all payments for worker medical insurance come from the bonus pool. The employees decide what type of coverage they want and the cost is deducted from their bonus. *deduct: 공제하다",
		"Inappropriate precision means giving information or figures to a greater degree of apparent accuracy than suits the context. For example, advertisers often use the results of surveys to prove what they say about their products. Sometimes they claim a level of precision not based reliably on evidence. So, if a company selling washing powder claims 95.45% of British adults agree that this powder washes whiter than any other, then this level of precision is clearly inappropriate. It is unlikely that all British adults were surveyed, so the results are based only on a sample and not the whole population. At best the company should be claiming that over 95% of those asked agreed that their powder washes whiter than any other. Even if the whole population had been surveyed, to have given the result to two decimal points would have been absurd. The effect is to propose a high degree of scientific precision in the research. Frequently, however, inappropriate precision is an attempt to mask the unscientific nature of a study.",
		"Sometimes animals seem unconcerned even when approached closely, whereas other times they disappear in a flash when you come in sight. Animals tend to be disturbed by unexpected and unpredictable events; quick movements and loud noises are particularly stressful. Animals that are regularly disturbed by visitors are more likely to tolerate your intrusion than those that have had little previous contact with humans. In Yellowstone National Park, for example, elk that live close to the town of Mammoth Hot Springs typically do not flee until cross­country skiers get within fifty feet. In more remote parts of the park, however, elk take flight when skiers are as much as a quarter mile away.",
		"The self is formed by social forces, by looking outwards as well as inwards. One way in which other people shape who you are is described by Leon Festinger’s theory. Simply put, imagine that you feel like you’re good at math because you came top of your class. But you feel that you’re bad at dancing after seeing other people at the school disco. These facts aren’t objective, of course. If you happen to be placed in a classroom of future professional statisticians, inevitably you feel relatively bad at math. On the upside, you may feel like you’re better at dancing. Festinger realized that these social comparisons aren’t entirely accidental. Humans actively seek out particular people and select particular skills or attributes for comparison.",
		"We often assume we see our physical surroundings as they actually are. But new research suggests that how we see the world depends on what we want from it. When a group of psychologists asked people to estimate how far away a bottle of water was, those who were thirsty guessed it was closer than nonthirsty people did. This difference in perception showed up in a physical challenge, too. When people were told to toss a beanbag at a $25 gift card, and that the closest would win it, people threw their beanbags nine inches short on average. But when the gift card’s value was $0, people threw their beanbags past the card by an inch. As the brain evolved, people who saw distances to goals as shorter might have gone after what they wanted more often. This error in perception was actually an advantage, leading people to get what they needed.",

		"Power distance is the term used to refer to how widely an unequal distribution of power is accepted by the members of a culture. It relates to the degree to which the less powerful members of a society accept their inequality in power and consider it the norm. In cultures with high acceptance of power distance (e.g., India, Brazil, Greece, Mexico, and the Philippines), people are not viewed as equals, and everyone has a clearly defined or allocated place in the social hierarchy. In cultures with low acceptance of power distance (e.g., Finland, Norway, New Zealand, and Israel), people believe inequality should be minimal, and a hierarchical division is viewed as one of convenience only. In these cultures, there is more fluidity within the social hierarchy, and it is relatively easy for individuals to move up the social hierarchy based on their individual efforts and achievements.",
		"Despite all the talk of how weak intentions are in the face of habits, it’s worth emphasizing that much of the time even our strong habits do follow our intentions. We are mostly doing what we intend to do, even though it’s happening automatically. This probably goes for many habits: although we perform them without bringing the intention to consciousness, the habits still line up with our original intentions. Even better, our automatic, unconscious habits can keep us safe even when our conscious mind is distracted. We look both ways before crossing the road despite thinking about a rather depressing holiday we took in Brazil, and we put oven gloves on before reaching into the oven despite being preoccupied about whether the cabbage is overcooked. In both cases, our goal of keeping ourselves alive and unburnt is served by our automatic, unconscious habits.",
		"The wife of American physiologist Hudson Hoagland became sick with a severe flu. Dr. Hoagland was curious enough to notice that whenever he left his wife’s room for a short while, she complained that he had been gone for a long time. In the interest of scientific investigation, he asked his wife to count to 60, with each count corresponding to what she felt was one second, while he kept a record of her temperature. His wife reluctantly accepted and he quickly noticed that the hotter she was, the faster she counted. When her temperature was 38 degrees Celsius, for instance, she counted to 60 in 45 seconds. He repeated the experiment a few more times, and found that when her temperature reached 39.5 degrees Celsius, she counted one minute in just 37 seconds. The doctor thought that his wife must have some kind of ‘internal clock’ inside her brain that ran faster as the fever went up.",
		"A primary school teacher is helping students to understand fractional parts by using what she thinks is a commonplace reference. “Today, we’re going to talk about cutting up a Thanksgiving holiday favorite―pumpkin pie.” She continues with an explanation of parts. Well into her discourse, a young African American boy, looking puzzled, asks, “What is pumpkin pie?” Most African Americans are likely to serve sweet potato pie for holiday dinners. In fact, one of the ways that African American parents explain pumpkin pie to their children is to say that it is something like sweet potato pie. For them, sweet potato pie is the common referent. Even the slight difference of being unfamiliar with pumpkin pie can serve as a source of interference for the student. Rather than be engaged actively in the lesson, he may have been preoccupied with trying to imagine pumpkin pie: What does it taste like? How does it smell? Is its texture chunky like apple or cherry pie? In the mind of a child, all of these questions can become more of the focus than the subject of fractions that the teacher is attempting to teach.",
		"There was an experiment conducted in 1995 by Sheena Iyengar, a professor of business at Columbia University. In a California gourmet market, Professor Iyengar and her research assistants set up a booth of samples of jams. Every few hours, they switched from offering an assortment of 24 bottles of jam to an assortment of just six bottles of jam. On average, customers tasted two jams, regardless of the size of the assortment, and each one received a coupon good for $1 off one jar of jam. Here’s the interesting part. Sixty percent of customers were drawn to the large assortment, while only 40 percent stopped by the small one. But 30 percent of the people who had sampled from the small assortment decided to buy jam, while only three percent of those confronted with the two dozen jams purchased a jar. Effectively, a greater number of people bought jam when the assortment size was 6 than when it was 24.",
		"When a child experiences painful, disappointing, or scary moments, it can be overwhelming, with intense emotions and bodily sensations flooding the right brain. When this happens, we as parents can help bring the left hemisphere into the picture so that the child can begin to understand what’s happening. One of the best ways to promote this type of integration is to help retell the story of the frightening or painful experience. Bella, for instance, was nine years old when the toilet overflowed when she flushed, and the experience of watching the water rise and pour onto the floor left her unwilling to flush the toilet afterward. When Bella’s father, Doug, learned about the “name it to tame it” technique, he sat down with his daughter and retold the story of the time the toilet overflowed. He allowed her to tell as much of the story as she could and helped to fill in the details. After retelling the story several times, Bella’s fears lessened and eventually went away.",
		"Intergroup contact is more likely to reduce stereotyping and create favorable attitudes if it is backed by social norms that promote equality among groups. If the norms support openness, friendliness, and mutual respect, the contact has a greater chance of changing attitudes and reducing prejudice than if they do not. Institutionally supported intergroup contact―that is, contact sanctioned by an outside authority or by established customs―is more likely to produce positive changes than unsupported contact. Without institutional support, members of an in­group may be reluctant to interact with outsiders because they feel doing so is deviant or simply inappropriate. With the presence of institutional support, however, contact between groups is more likely to be seen as appropriate, expected, and worthwhile. For instance, with respect to desegregation in elementary schools, there is evidence that students were more highly motivated and learned more in classes conducted by teachers (that is, authority figures) who supported rather than opposed desegregation.",
		"When we see an adorable creature, we must fight an overwhelming urge to squeeze that cuteness. And pinch it, and cuddle it, and maybe even bite it. This is a perfectly normal psychological tick―an oxymoron called “cute aggression”―and even though it sounds cruel, it’s not about causing harm at all. In fact, strangely enough, this compulsion may actually make us more caring. The first study to look at cute aggression in the human brain has now revealed that this is a complex neurological response, involving several parts of the brain. The researchers propose that cute aggression may stop us from becoming so emotionally overloaded that we are unable to look after things that are super cute. “Cute aggression may serve as a tempering mechanism that allows us to function and actually take care of something we might first perceive as overwhelmingly cute,” explains the lead author, Stavropoulos.",
		"Psychologist John Bargh did an experiment showing human perception and behavior can be influenced by external factors. He told a bunch of healthy undergraduates that he was testing their language abilities. He presented them with a list of words and asked them to create a coherent sentence from it. One of the lists was “DOWN SAT LONELY THE MAN WRINKLED BITTERLY THE WITH FACE OLD”. “Bitterly, the lonely old man with the wrinkled face sat down” is one possible solution. But this was no linguistics test. Bargh was interested in how long it took the students to leave the lab and walk down the hall after they were exposed to the words. What he found was extraordinary. Those students who had been exposed to an “elderly” mix of words took almost 40 percent longer to walk down the hall than those who had been exposed to “random” words. Some students even walked with their shoulders bent forwards, dragging their feet as they left, as if they were 50 years older than they actually were.",
		"Some natural resource­rich developing countries tend to create an excessive dependence on their natural resources, which generates a lower productive diversification and a lower rate of growth. Resource abundance in itself need not do any harm: many countries have abundant natural resources and have managed to outgrow their dependence on them by diversifying their economic activity. That is the case of Canada, Australia, or the US, to name the most important ones. But some developing countries are trapped in their dependence on their large natural resources. They suffer from a series of problems since a heavy dependence on natural capital tends to exclude other types of capital and thereby interfere with economic growth.",
		"Why do we help? One widely held view is that self‒interest underlies all human interactions, that our constant goal is to maximize rewards and minimize costs. Accountants call it cost‒benefit analysis. Philosophers call it utilitarianism. Social psychologists call it social exchange theory. If you are considering whether to donate blood, you may weigh the costs of doing so (time, discomfort, and anxiety) against the benefits (reduced guilt, social approval, and good feelings). If the rewards exceed the costs, you will help. Others believe that we help because we have been socialized to do so, through norms that prescribe how we ought to behave. Through socialization, we learn the reciprocity norm: the expectation that we should return help, not harm, to those who have helped us. In our relations with others of similar status, the reciprocity norm compels us to give (in favors, gifts, or social invitations) about as much as we receive.",
		"Some researchers at Sheffield University recruited 129 hobbyists to look at how the time spent on their hobbies shaped their work life. To begin with, the team measured the seriousness of each participant’s hobby, asking them to rate their agreement with statements like “I regularly train for this activity,” and also assessed how similar the demands of their job and hobby were. Then, each month for seven months, participants recorded how many hours they had dedicated to their activity, and completed a scale measuring their belief in their ability to effectively do their job, or their “self­efficacy.” The researchers found that when participants spent longer than normal doing their leisure activity, their belief in their ability to perform their job increased. But this was only the case when they had a serious hobby that was dissimilar to their job. When their hobby was both serious and similar to their job, then spending more time on it actually decreased their self­efficacy.",
		"In 2011, Micah Edelson and his colleagues conducted an interesting experiment about external factors of memory manipulation. In their experiment, participants were shown a two minute documentary film and then asked a series of questions about the video. Directly after viewing the videos, participants made few errors in their responses and were correctly able to recall the details. Four days later, they could still remember the details and didn’t allow their memories to be swayed when they were presented with any false information about the film. This changed, however, when participants were shown fake responses about the film made by other participants. Upon seeing the incorrect answers of others, participants were also drawn toward the wrong answers themselves. Even after they found out that the other answers had been fabricated and didn’t have anything to do with the documentary, it was too late. The participants were no longer able to distinguish between truth and fiction. They had already modified their memories to fit the group.",
		"At the University of Iowa, students were briefly shown numbers that they had to memorize. Then they were offered the choice of either a fruit salad or a chocolate cake. When the number the students memorized was seven digits long, 63% of them chose the cake. When the number they were asked to remember had just two digits, however, 59% opted for the fruit salad. Our reflective brains know that the fruit salad is better for our health, but our reflexive brains desire that soft, fattening chocolate cake. If the reflective brain is busy figuring something else out—like trying to remember a seven­digit number—then impulse can easily win. On the other hand, if we’re not thinking too hard about something else (with only a minor distraction like memorizing two digits), then the reflective system can deny the emotional impulse of the reflexive side.",
		"Anne Thorndike, a primary care physician in Boston, had a crazy idea. She believed she could improve the eating habits of thousands of hospital staff and visitors without changing their willpower or motivation in the slightest way. In fact, she didn’t plan on talking to them at all. Thorndike designed a study to alter the “choice architecture” of the hospital cafeteria. She started by changing how drinks were arranged in the room. Originally, the refrigerators located next to the cash registers in the cafeteria were filled with only soda. She added water as an option to each one. Additionally, she placed baskets of bottled water next to the food stations throughout the room. Soda was still in the primary refrigerators, but water was now available at all drink locations. Over the next three months, the number of soda sales at the hospital dropped by 11.4 percent. Meanwhile, sales of bottled water increased by 25.8 percent.",
		"Music is used to mold customer experience and behavior. A study was conducted that explored what impact it has on employees. Results from the study indicate that participants who listen to rhythmic music were inclined to cooperate more irrespective of factors like age, gender, and academic background, compared to those who listened to less rhythmic music. This positive boost in the participants’ willingness to cooperate was induced regardless of whether they liked the music or not. When people are in a more positive state of mind, they tend to become more agreeable and creative, while those on the opposite spectrum tend to focus on their individual problems rather than giving attention to solving group problems. The rhythm of music has a strong pull on people’s behavior. This is because when people listen to music with a steady pulse, they tend to match their actions to the beat. This translates to better teamwork when making decisions because everyone is following one tempo.",
		"In a study, Guy Mayraz, a behavioral economist, showed his experimental subjects graphs of a price rising and falling over time. The graphs were actually of past changes in the stock market, but Mayraz told people that the graphs showed recent changes in the price of wheat. He asked each person to predict where the price would move next―and offered them a reward if their forecasts came true. But Mayraz had also divided his participants into two categories, “farmers” and “bakers”. Farmers would be paid extra if wheat prices were high. Bakers would earn a bonus if wheat was cheap. So the subjects might earn two separate payments: one for an accurate forecast, and a bonus if the price of wheat moved in their direction. Mayraz found that the prospect of the bonus influenced the forecast itself. The farmers hoped and predicted that the price of wheat would rise. The bakers hoped for―and predicted―the opposite. They let their hopes influence their reasoning.",
		"Distance is a reliable indicator of the relationship between two people. Strangers stand further apart than do acquaintances, acquaintances stand further apart than friends, and friends stand further apart than romantic partners. Sometimes, of course, these rules are violated. Recall the last time you rode 20 stories in an elevator packed with total strangers. The sardine­like experience no doubt made the situation a bit uncomfortable. With your physical space violated, you may have tried to create “psychological” space by avoiding eye contact, focusing instead on the elevator buttons. By reducing closeness in one nonverbal channel (eye contact), one can compensate for unwanted closeness in another channel (proximity). Similarly, if you are talking with someone who is seated several feet away at a large table, you are likely to maintain constant eye contact— something you might feel uncomfortable doing if you were standing next to each other.",
		"The great irony of performance psychology is that it teaches each sportsman to believe, as far as he is able, that he will win. No man doubts. No man indulges his inner skepticism. That is the logic of sports psychology. But only one man can win. That is the logic of sport. Note the difference between a scientist and an athlete. Doubt is a scientist’s stock in trade. Progress is made by focusing on the evidence that refutes a theory and by improving the theory accordingly. Skepticism is the rocket fuel of scientific advance. But doubt, to an athlete, is poison. Progress is made by ignoring the evidence; it is about creating a mindset that is immune to doubt and uncertainty. Just to reiterate: From a rational perspective, this is nothing less than crazy. Why should an athlete convince himself he will win when he knows that there is every possibility he will lose? Because, to win, one must proportion one’s belief, not to the evidence, but to whatever the mind can usefully get away with.",
		"Greenwashing involves misleading a consumer into thinking a good or service is more environmentally friendly than it really is. Greenwashing ranges from making environmental claims required by law, and therefore irrelevant (CFC‐free for example), to puffery (exaggerating environmental claims) to fraud. Researchers have shown that claims on products are often too vague or misleading. Some products are labeled “chemical‐free,” when the fact is everything contains chemicals, including plants and animals. Products with the highest number of misleading or unverifiable claims were laundry detergents, household cleaners, and paints. Environmental advocates agree there is still a long way to go to ensure shoppers are adequately informed about the environmental impact of the products they buy. The most common reason for greenwashing is to attract environmentally conscious consumers. Many consumers do not find out about the false claims until after the purchase. Therefore, greenwashing may increase sales in the short term. However, this strategy can seriously backfire when consumers find out they are being deceived.",
		"A study investigated the economic cost of prejudice based on blind assumptions. Researchers gave a group of Danish teenagers the choice of working with one of two people. The teenager had never met either of them. One of the people had a name that suggested they were from a similar ethnic or religious background to the teenager. The other had a name that suggested they were from a different ethnic or religious background. The study showed that the teenagers were prepared to earn an average of 8% less if they could work with someone they thought came from the same ethnic or religious background. And this prejudice was evident among teenagers with ethnic majority names as well as those with ethnic minority names. The teenagers were blindly making assumptions about the race of their potential colleagues. They then applied prejudice to those assumptions, to the point where they actually allowed that prejudice to reduce their own potential income. The job required the two teenagers to work together for just 90 minutes.",
		"A young child may be puzzled when asked to distinguish between the directions of right and left. But that same child may have no difficulty in determining the directions of up and down or back and front. Scientists propose that this occurs because, although we experience three dimensions, only two had a strong influence on our evolution: the vertical dimension as defined by gravity and, in mobile species, the front/back dimension as defined by the positioning of sensory and feeding mechanisms. These influence our perception of vertical versus horizontal, far versus close, and the search for dangers from above (such as an eagle) or below (such as a snake). However, the left‑right axis is not as relevant in nature. A bear is equally dangerous from its left or the right side, but not if it is upside down. In fact, when observing a scene containing plants, animals, and man‑made objects such as cars or street signs, we can only tell when left and right have been inverted if we observe those artificial items.",
		"People behave in highly predictable ways when they experience certain thoughts. When they agree, they nod their heads. So far, no surprise, but according to an area of research known as “proprioceptive psychology,” the process also works in reverse. Get people to behave in a certain way and you cause them to have certain thoughts. The idea was initially controversial, but fortunately it was supported by a compelling experiment. Participants in a study were asked to fixate on various products moving across a large computer screen and then indicate whether the items appealed to them. Some of the items moved vertically (causing the participants to nod their heads while watching), and others moved horizontally (resulting in a side­to­side head movement). Participants preferred vertically moving products without being aware that their “yes” and “no” head movements had played a key role in their decisions.",
		"In 2006, researchers conducted a study on the motivations for helping after the September 11th terrorist attacks against the United States. In the study, they found that individuals who gave money, blood, goods, or other forms of assistance because of other­focused motives (giving to reduce another’s discomfort) were almost four times more likely to still be giving support one year later than those whose original motivation was to reduce personal distress. This effect likely stems from differences in emotional arousal. The events of September 11th emotionally affected people throughout the United States. Those who gave to reduce their own distress reduced their emotional arousal with their initial gift, discharging that emotional distress. However, those who gave to reduce others’ distress did not stop empathizing with victims who continued to struggle long after the attacks.",
		"Multiple laboratory studies show that cooperative people tend to receive social advantages from others. One way to demonstrate this is to give people the opportunity to act positively or negatively toward contributors. For example, Pat Barclay, a professor at the University of Guelph, had participants play a cooperative game where people could contribute money toward a group fund which helped all group members, and then allowed participants to give money to other participants based on their reputations. People who contributed more to the group fund were given responsibility for more money than people who contributed less. Similar results have been found by other researchers. People who contribute toward their groups are also chosen more often as interaction partners, preferred as leaders, rated as more desirable partners for long-term relationships, and are perceived to be trustworthy and have high social status. Uncooperative people tend to receive verbal criticism or even more severe punishment.",
		"The fast­growing, tremendous amount of data, collected and stored in large and numerous data repositories, has far exceeded our human ability for understanding without powerful tools. As a result, data collected in large data repositories become “data tombs”—data archives that are hardly visited. Important decisions are often made based not on the information–rich data stored in data repositories but rather on a decision maker’s instinct, simply because the decision maker does not have the tools to extract the valuable knowledge hidden in the vast amounts of data. Efforts have been made to develop expert system and knowledge­based technologies, which typically rely on users or domain experts to manually input knowledge into knowledge bases. However, this procedure is likely to cause biases and errors and is extremely costly and time consuming. The widening gap between data and information calls for the systematic development of tools that can turn data tombs into “golden nuggets” of knowledge.",
		"Plato and Tolstoy both assume that it can be firmly established that certain works have certain effects. Plato is sure that the representation of cowardly people makes us cowardly; the only way to prevent this effect is to suppress such representations. Tolstoy is confident that the artist who sincerely expresses feelings of pride will pass those feelings on to us; we can no more escape than we could escape an infectious disease. In fact, however, the effects of art are neither so certain nor so direct. People vary a great deal both in the intensity of their response to art and in the form which that response takes. Some people may indulge fantasies of violence by watching a film instead of working out those fantasies in real life. Others may be disgusted by even glamorous representations of violence. Still others may be left unmoved, neither attracted nor disgusted.",
		"Performance must be judged in terms of what is under the control of the individuals being evaluated rather than those influences on performance that are beyond their control. There can be broad, influential factors, sometimes of an economic nature, that hold down the performance of everyone being judged. One example is in sales. If there is a general downturn in the economy and products or services are not being purchased with the same frequency as in the previous year, sales could be down, for example, by an average of 15%. This 15% (actually －15%) figure would then represent “average” performance. Perhaps the best salesperson in the year had only a 3% drop in sales over the previous year. Thus, “good” performance in this situation is a smaller loss compared to some average or norm group.",
		"The impacts of tourism on the environment are evident to scientists, but not all residents attribute environmental damage to tourism. Residents commonly have positive views on the economic and some sociocultural influences of tourism on quality of life, but their reactions to environmental impacts are mixed. Some residents feel tourism provides more parks and recreation areas, improves the quality of the roads and public facilities, and does not contribute to ecological decline. Many do not blame tourism for traffic problems, overcrowded outdoor recreation, or the disturbance of peace and tranquility of parks. Alternatively, some residents express concern that tourists overcrowd the local fishing, hunting, and other recreation areas or may cause traffic and pedestrian congestion. Some studies suggest that variations in residents’ feelings about tourism’s relationship to environmental damage are related to the type of tourism, the extent to which residents feel the natural environment needs to be protected, and the distance residents live from the tourist attractions.",
		"Time spent on on-line interaction with members of one’s own, preselected community leaves less time available for actual encounters with a wide variety of people. If physicists, for example, were to concentrate on exchanging email and electronic preprints with other physicists around the world working in the same specialized subject area, they would likely devote less time, and be less receptive to new ways of looking at the world. Facilitating the voluntary construction of highly homogeneous social networks of scientific communication therefore allows individuals to filter the potentially overwhelming flow of information. But the result may be the tendency to overfilter it, thus eliminating the diversity of the knowledge circulating and diminishing the frequency of radically new ideas. In this regard, even a journey through the stacks of a real library can be more fruitful than a trip through today’s distributed virtual archives, because it seems difficult to use the available “search engines” to emulate efficiently the mixture of predictable and surprising discoveries that typically result from a physical shelf-search of an extensive library collection.",
		"Biological organisms, including human societies both with and without market systems, discount distant outputs over those available at the present time based on risks associated with an uncertain future. As the timing of inputs and outputs varies greatly depending on the type of energy, there is a strong case to incorporate time when assessing energy alternatives. For example, the energy output from solar panels or wind power engines, where most investment happens before they begin producing, may need to be assessed differently when compared to most fossil fuel extraction technologies, where a large proportion of the energy output comes much sooner, and a larger (relative) proportion of inputs is applied during the extraction process, and not upfront. Thus fossil fuels, particularly oil and natural gas, in addition to having energy quality advantages (cost, storability, transportability, etc.) over many renewable technologies, also have a “temporal advantage” after accounting for human behavioral preference for current consumption/return.",
		"Because elephant groups break up and reunite very frequently―for instance, in response to variation in food availability―reunions are more important in elephant society than among primates. And the species has evolved elaborate greeting behaviors, the form of which reflects the strength of the social bond between the individuals (much like how you might merely shake hands with a long-standing acquaintance but hug a close friend you have not seen in a while, and maybe even tear up). Elephants may greet each other simply by reaching their trunks into each other’s mouths, possibly equivalent to a human peck on the cheek. However, after long absences, members of family and bond groups greet one another with incredibly theatrical displays. The fact that the intensity reflects the duration of the separation as well as the level of intimacy suggests that elephants have a sense of time as well. To human eyes, these greetings strike a familiar chord. I’m reminded of the joyous reunions so visible in the arrivals area of an international airport terminal.",
		"From a cross-cultural perspective the equation between public leadership and dominance is questionable. What does one mean by ‘dominance’? Does it indicate coercion? Or control over ‘the most valued’? ‘Political’ systems may be about both, either, or conceivably neither. The idea of ‘control’ would be a bothersome one for many peoples, as for instance among many native peoples of Amazonia where all members of a community are fond of their personal autonomy and notably allergic to any obvious expression of control or coercion. The conception of political power as a coercive force, while it may be a Western fixation, is not a universal. It is very unusual for an Amazonian leader to give an order. If many peoples do not view political power as a coercive force, nor as the most valued domain, then the leap from ‘the political’ to ‘domination’ (as coercion), and from there to ‘domination of women’, is a shaky one. As Marilyn Strathern has remarked, the notions of ‘the political’ and ‘political personhood’ are cultural obsessions of our own, a bias long reflected in anthropological constructs.",
		"Philip Kitcher and Wesley Salmon have suggested that there are two possible alternatives among philosophical theories of explanation. One is the view that scientific explanation consists in the unification of broad bodies of phenomena under a minimal number of generalizations. According to this view, the (or perhaps, a) goal of science is to construct an economical framework of laws or generalizations that are capable of subsuming all observable phenomena. Scientific explanations organize and systematize our knowledge of the empirical world; the more economical the systematization, the deeper our understanding of what is explained. The other view is the causal/mechanical approach. According to it, a scientific explanation of a phenomenon consists of uncovering the mechanisms that produced the phenomenon of interest. This view sees the explanation of individual events as primary, with the explanation of generalizations flowing from them. That is, the explanation of scientific generalizations comes from the causal mechanisms that produce the regularities.",
		"“Craftsmanship” may suggest a way of life that declined with the arrival of industrial society―but this is misleading. Craftsmanship names an enduring, basic human impulse, the desire to do a job well for its own sake. Craftsmanship cuts a far wider swath than skilled manual labor; it serves the computer programmer, the doctor, and the artist; parenting improves when it is practiced as a skilled craft, as does citizenship. In all these domains, craftsmanship focuses on objective standards, on the thing in itself. Social and economic conditions, however, often stand in the way of the craftsman’s discipline and commitment: schools may fail to provide the tools to do good work, and workplaces may not truly value the aspiration for quality. And though craftsmanship can reward an individual with a sense of pride in work, this reward is not simple. The craftsman often faces conflicting objective standards of excellence; the desire to do something well for its own sake can be weakened by competitive pressure, by frustration, or by obsession.",
		"Even those with average talent can produce notable work in the various sciences, so long as they do not try to embrace all of them at once. Instead, they should concentrate attention on one subject after another (that is, in different periods of time), although later work will weaken earlier attainments in the other spheres. This amounts to saying that the brain adapts to universal science in time but not in space. In fact, even those with great abilities proceed in this way. Thus, when we are astonished by someone with publications in different scientific fields, realize that each topic was explored during a specific period of time. Knowledge gained earlier certainly will not have disappeared from the mind of the author, but it will have become simplified by condensing into formulas or greatly abbreviated symbols. Thus, sufficient space remains for the perception and learning of new images on the cerebral blackboard.",
		"Plants generate hundreds of compounds that they use to protect themselves from being overconsumed by insects and animals. While some plants use these compounds to reduce all foraging, most plants tolerate, or even enjoy, about an 18 percent foraging rate (10 to 25 percent depending on the plant) before they begin to initiate high levels of protective compounds. Many of the actions of animals when they eat plants (termed “herbivory”) are necessary for both plant and ecosystem health. Herbivory alters the density, composition, and health of plant communities through eating plants, dispersing seeds, and defecation. Some plants produce an initial series of leaves designed to be eaten, and more luxurious growth only occurs once that has happened. For many plants, metabolism and respiration are all stimulated by animal and insect feeding. It is only after foraging rises above a certain level that many plant defensive compounds are produced in quantity or come into play.",
		"Social neuroscientist John Cacioppo conducted a brain imaging study to identify differences in the neural mechanisms of lonely and non-lonely people. Specifically, he wanted to know what’s going on in the brains of individuals with an acute sense of loneliness. While in an MRI machine, subjects viewed a series of images, some with positive associations, such as happy people doing fun things, and others with negative associations, such as scenes of people in dispute. As the two groups watched pleasant imagery, the area of the brain that recognizes rewards showed a significantly greater response in non-lonely people than in lonely people. Similarly, the visual cortex of lonely subjects responded much more strongly to unpleasant images of people than to unpleasant images of objects―suggesting that the attention of lonely people is especially drawn to discord among people. Non-lonely subjects showed no such difference.",
		"An ant turns right, left, and moves ahead over a sandy hill. How can we explain the complexity of the path it chose? We can think up a sophisticated program in the ant’s brain, but it does not work. What we have overlooked is the ant’s environment. The ant may be following a simple rule: get out of the sun and back to the nest. Complex behavior does not imply complex mental strategies. The same holds for humans. The apparent complexity of a man’s behavior over time is largely a reflection of the complexity of the environment in which he finds himself. People adapt to their environments much as gelatin does; if you wish to know what form it will have when it solidifies, study the shape of the mold that holds the gelatin. To understand behavior, one has to look at both the mind and the environment.",
		"One very important factor in the persuasiveness of a communication concerns the credibility of the sender of the message. Kelman and Hovland performed a study in which people heard a talk about juvenile delinquency, given by one of three speakers. One of the speakers claimed to be a juvenile court judge, and therefore was thought to have high credibility; one speaker was described as a random member of the studio audience, whose credibility was thought to be neutral; and one speaker was described as a ‘pickpocket’, and so was thought to have low credibility. Kelman and Hovland found that the more credible the communicator was, the more influence their talk had exerted on the listeners. However, when they retested the research participants four weeks later, they found that the source effect had entirely disappeared. People remembered what had been said, but not who had said it. So it is possible that the credibility of the source is important only in the short term.",
		"Experts have found that reading classical texts benefits the mind by catching the reader’s attention and triggering moments of self-reflection. The brain activity of volunteers was monitored as they read classical works. These same texts were then “translated” into more straightforward, modern language and again the readers’ brains were monitored as they read the words. Scans showed that the more challenging prose and poetry set off far more electrical activity in the brain than the more pedestrian versions. Scientists were able to study the brain activity as it responded to each word and record how it lit up as the readers encountered unusual words, surprising phrases or difficult sentence structures. This lighting up lasts long enough to shift the brain into a higher gear, encouraging further reading. The research also found that reading the more challenging version of poetry, in particular, increases activity in the right hemisphere of the brain, helping the readers to reflect on and reevaluate their own experiences in light of what they have read. The academics said this meant the classics were more useful than self-help books.",
		"Centuries ago, philosophers regarded memory as a soft wax tablet that would preserve anything imprinted on it. With the advent of the printing press, people began to think of memory as a library that stores events and facts for later retrieval. (Those of us of a certain age still think of it that way, muttering about where we “filed” information in our mental cabinets.) With the inventions of movies and tape recorders, people started thinking of memory as a video camera, clicking on at the moment of birth and automatically recording every moment thereafter. Nowadays we think of memory in computer terms, and although some of us wish for more RAM, we assume that just about everything that happens to us is “saved.” Your brain might not choose to screen all those memories, but they are in there, just waiting for you to retrieve them.",
		"The main reason you’re drawn to novel or surprising things is that it could upset the safe, predictable status quo and even threaten your survival. If you’ve ever tried to carry on a conversation in a room in which a TV is playing, you know that it’s hard not to glance at the screen occasionally. Even if you don’t want to watch, your brain is attracted by that constantly shifting stream of images, because change can have life­or­death consequences. Indeed, if our early African ancestors hadn’t been good at fixing all their attention on the just­ripened fruit or the approaching predators, we wouldn’t be here. For the same reason, a strong sensitivity to the odd detail that doesn’t quite correspond with the way things usually are or ought to be is a major asset for a soldier in a war zone. Even in everyday situations, you can’t afford to miss that jaywalker darting in front of your car or the single new and important fact in a long, boring list.",
		"In a recent article, psychology professor Patricia Greenfield of UCLA discussed some of the problems caused when a test designed for one culture is used to test members of a different culture. This situation often causes inaccurate test results. For instance, she wrote, “When children of Latino immigrant parents go to school, their emphasis on understanding rather than speaking, on respecting the teacher’s authority rather than expressing one’s own opinions leads to negative academic assessment.” She described a study of parent-teacher conferences in which a teacher complained that the children did not speak up and equated it to a bad attitude. “Hence a valued mode of communication in one culture―respectful listening― becomes the basis for a rather negative evaluation in the school setting where self-assertive speaking is the valued mode of communication.”",
		"There are two types of managers in business organizations: functional managers and project managers. Both types of managers have different roles and qualities. Functional managers head one of a firm’s departments such as marketing or engineering, and they are specialists in the area they manage. They are skilled at breaking the components of a system into smaller elements, knowing something of the details of each operation for which they are responsible. On the other hand, project managers begin their career as specialists in some field. When promoted to the position of project manager, they must transform from technical caterpillar to generalist butterfly. They oversee many functional areas, each with its own specialists. Therefore, what is required is an ability to put many pieces of a task together to form a coherent whole. Thus, to understand a frog, for example, functional managers cut it open to examine it, but project managers watch it swim with other frogs and consider the environment.",
		"New York University psychologist Gabriele Oettingen studied women enrolled in a weight‒reduction program trying to lose a few pounds. In the study, the participants used positive thinking―imagining themselves reaching their goals―as a motivator. The results weren’t so positive. “A year later, I checked in on these women from the weight‒loss study,” Oettingen writes in the New York Times, and “the more positively women had imagined themselves in these scenarios, the fewer pounds they had lost.” As the above study and others of Oettingen’s found, positive thinking makes people feel comfortable with their present state. Too comfortable. Dreaming of the future “can drain you of the energy you need to take action in pursuit of your goals,” she says. “Positive thinking fools our minds into perceiving that we’ve already attained our goal, slackening our readiness to pursue it.”",
		"Certain species are more crucial to the maintenance of their ecosystem than others. Such species, called keystone species, are vital in determining the nature and structure of the entire ecosystem. The fact that other species depend on or are greatly affected by the keystone species is revealed when the keystone species is removed. It is in this sense that we should draw attention to fig trees. Different species of fig trees may be keystone species in tropical rain forests. Although figs collectively produce a continuous crop of fruits, fruit-eating monkeys, birds, bats, and other vertebrates of the forest do not normally consume large quantities of figs in their diets. During the time of year when other fruits are less plentiful, however, fig trees become important in sustaining fruit-eating vertebrates. Should the fig trees disappear, most of the fruit-eating vertebrates would be eliminated. Protecting fig trees in such tropical rainforest ecosystems is an important conservation goal because it increases the likelihood that monkeys, birds, bats, and other vertebrates will survive.",
		"We can simply state our beliefs, or we can tell stories that illustrate them. For example, if John tells Bill that he is confused about whether he should keep a cat or a dog as a pet, and if Bill responds “A cat,” his reply would usually be seen as useless advice. We need justifications for the beliefs of others before we can begin to believe them ourselves. If Bill responds, “A cat is good, because the cat is cute and quiet,” he is being more helpful but not necessarily more believable. But if Bill responds with a story about a similar situation that he was in or that he heard about and how the choice was made in that case and how it worked out, John is likely to be quite interested and to take the advice offered by the story more to heart.",
		"People tell about their own experiences all the time, but they do not necessarily tell about the same experience in the same way every time. The telling process, even in the relating of a firsthand experience, can be a highly inventive process. That is, the art of storytelling involves finding good ways to express one’s experiences in a way appropriate to the listener. A fine line exists, therefore, between invented stories and the relation of firsthand experiences. The entertainment factor exists in relating firsthand experiences just as it does in inventing stories. Nobody wants to listen to what happened to you today unless you can make what happened appear interesting. The process of livening up an experience can involve simply telling that experience in such a way as to eliminate the dullest parts, or it also can involve ‘improving’ the dull parts by playing with the facts.",
		"Mitterer and de Ruiter used a color categorization paradigm to study the relationship between “world knowledge” and color categories. First, half of the observers saw typically orange objects (e.g., carrot) in a good orange and typically yellow objects (e.g., banana) in a hue midway between orange and yellow. The other half saw typically orange objects in the intermediate hue and typically yellow objects in a good yellow. Later, observers were asked to categorize a color-neutral object (e.g., sock) colored somewhere between yellow and orange as either yellow or orange. The researchers found that if the observers had seen typically yellow objects in the intermediate hue, this hue was subsequently categorized as yellow. The reverse was true for the observers who had seen typically orange objects in the intermediate hue.",
		"Lawyers and scientists use argument to mean a summary of evidence and principles leading to a conclusion; however, a scientific argument is different from a legal argument. A prosecuting attorney constructs an argument to persuade the judge or a jury that the accused is guilty; a defense attorney in the same trial constructs an argument to persuade the same judge or jury toward the opposite conclusion. Neither prosecutor nor defender is obliged to consider anything that weakens their respective cases. On the contrary, scientists construct arguments because they want to test their own ideas and give an accurate explanation of some aspect of nature. Scientists can include any evidence or hypothesis that supports their claim, but they must observe one fundamental rule of professional science. They must include all of the known evidence and all of the hypotheses previously proposed. Unlike lawyers, scientists must explicitly account for the possibility that they might be wrong.",
		"National tragedies create what psychologists call “flashbulb” memories, named for the vivid images that we retain: where we were when we got the news, how we learned it, how we felt, what we did. These memories are thought to be unforgettable, and it is true that the broad outlines of such catastrophes, thoroughly reported in the media, are well remembered, but your memory of your personal circumstances surrounding the events may not necessarily be precise. There have been numerous studies of this phenomenon, including surveys of fifteen hundred Americans’ memories of the September 11 attacks. In this study, the respondents’ memories were surveyed a week after the attacks, again a year later, and then again three years and ten years later. Respondents’ most emotional memories of their personal details at the time they learned of the attacks are also those of which they are most confident and, paradoxically, the ones that have most changed over the years relative to other memories about 9/11.",
		"In science one experiment, whether it succeeds or fails, is logically followed by another in a theoretically infinite progression. According to the underlying myth of modern science, this progression is always replacing the smaller knowledge of the past with the larger knowledge of the present, which will be replaced by the yet larger knowledge of the future. In the arts, by contrast, no limitless sequence of works is ever implied or looked for. No work of art is necessarily followed by a second work that is necessarily better. Given the methodologies of science, the law of gravity and the genome were bound to be discovered by somebody; the identity of the discoverer is incidental to the fact. But it appears that in the arts there are no second chances. We must assume that we had one chance each for The Divine Comedy and King Lear. If Dante and Shakespeare had died before they wrote those works, nobody ever would have written them.",
		"The fact that dreaded diseases are more common in the tropics than at higher latitudes may in part explain a curious feature of how languages are distributed: near the equator, language densities (the number of languages per unit area) are much higher, and language communities (the number of people speaking a given language) very much smaller, than they are at higher latitudes. One explanation for this might be that it is a culturally evolved strategy to reduce the risk of cross­infection in areas where pathogens are more densely concentrated. Language barriers significantly reduce the opportunities for contact between different populations, thus minimizing the risk of contamination. Creating smaller, more inward­looking, xenophobic societies may thus help to reduce exposure to diseases to which one has no natural immunity.",
		"Getting first­rate health care will always be quite different from ordering something from an online bookstore. We’re talking about the most precious part of life―one’s health―not buying a book. But the common thread is the power of information and individualization. We are embarking on a time when each individual will have all their own medical data and the computing power to process it in the context of their own world. There will be comprehensive medical information about a person that is highly accessible, analyzable, and transferable. This will set up a fundamental power shift, putting the individual at center stage. No longer will MD stand for medical deity. What have been called the six most powerful words of the English language—“The doctor will see you now”—will no longer be true. Indeed you will still be seeing doctors, but the relationship will be radically altered.",
		"According to Skinner, we, too, in most aspects of our lives, are like pigeons pecking at a button to receive little snacks. And this, according to the cognitive scientist Tom Stafford, explains the check-in impulse behind email and other online technologies. Unlike food, email isn’t always rewarding; in fact, it is often annoying. Once upon a time, there could be no new email for days at a time. Much of what we get is uninteresting or indeed difficult to deal with. But every so often we get a message we are very glad to have. That such “rewarding” email comes unpredictably does not dim its attractiveness or keep us from looking for it. On the contrary, the most effective way of maintaining a behavior is not with a consistent, predictable reward, but rather with what is termed “variable reinforcement”—that is, rewards that vary in their frequency or magnitude.",
		"When considered in terms of evolutionary success, many of the seemingly irrational choices that people make do not seem so foolish after all. Most animals, including our ancestors and modern-day capuchin monkeys, lived very close to the margin of survival. Paleontologists who study early human civilizations have uncovered evidence that our ancestors faced frequent periods of drought and freezing. When you are living on the verge of starvation, a slight downturn in your food reserves makes a lot more difference than a slight upturn. Anthropologists who study people still living in hunter-gatherer societies have discovered that they regularly make choices designed to produce not the best opportunity for obtaining a hyperabundant supply of food but, instead, the least danger of ending up with an insufficient supply. In other words, people everywhere have a strong motivation to avoid falling below the level that will feed themselves and their families. If our ancestors hadn’t agonized over losses and instead had taken too many chances in going after the big gains, they’d have been more likely to lose out and never become anyone’s ancestor.",
		"Paradoxes are statements that seem contradictory but are actually true. Paradoxical values are found within cultures and between cultures. An example is the individual freedom­belonging paradox. Individualism is a strong element of American society, and so is the need to belong. It seems paradoxical that both freedom and belonging are strong values of a single culture. The explanation is that in an individualistic society where people want to “do things their own way” and “go it alone,” people tend to become lonely if they don’t make an effort to belong. The opposite is found in Japan, where belonging is an integral part of society, and it takes an effort to behave in an individualistic way. According to the American Society of Association Executives in Washington, D.C., in 1995, there were some 100,000 associations and clubs in the United States. Seven of every 10 Americans belong to at least one club. There is no such phenomenon in Japan.",
		"The weakness of local networks lies in their self-containment, for they lack input as well as outreach. In a classic study of urban politics, Herbert Gans found that neighborhoods with the highest levels of solidarity often were unable to block unfavorable policies and programs for lack of ties to possible allies elsewhere in the city. It was for this reason that Gans referred to them as “urban villagers.” As the opposite of local networks, cosmopolitan networks offer little solidarity and have little capacity to comfort and sustain members. But members benefit from a constant flow of new information and from the great reach of their influence, even if it tends to be somewhat lacking in strength. Local networks tend to be small. In contrast, cosmopolitan networks can be huge. Thus, while the “urban villagers” lacked ties even to their local city government, cosmopolitan network ties often lead into the White House.",
		"Perspective is defined as the art of picturing objects as they appear to the eye. We have been taught to represent distant objects as smaller, thereby giving the illusion of depth. But are they really smaller? The child knows that the man fifty feet away is just as big as the one five feet away. So why draw one smaller than the other? The child’s drawings are not reproductions of an optical image. He uses size to impart emphasis and importance. He draws his concept of the object. His drawing is consequently more meaningful than a faithful reproduction. Objectivity can be achieved by photography. Many true artists use distortion, exaggeration, or reduction to essentials. The child draws the man bigger than the tree in his front yard because to him the man is more significant. For the same reason, we see the person bigger than the house.",
		"Major long­term threats to deep­sea fishes, as with all life on the planet, derive from trends of global climate change. Although deep­sea fishes are generally cold­water species, warming of the oceans itself may not be a direct threat. Many of the deep­sea fishes originated during the early Cretaceous when the deep sea was warm, and the Mediterranean Sea, which is warm down to a depth of over 5,000m, is populated by deep­sea fishes. On the other hand, substantial changes may be expected in ocean ecosystems over the next 100 years driven by an increase in dissolved carbon dioxide and consequent ocean acidification resulting from burning of fossil fuels. Although the effects on deep­sea fishes are likely to be indirect through loss of coral habitats and changes in prey availability, larval stages of deep­sea fishes in the surface layers of the ocean may be directly affected by acidity.",
		"In 2006, researchers at the University of Missouri took twenty-eight undergraduates and asked them to memorize lists of words and then recall these words at a later time. To test whether distraction affected their ability to memorize, the researchers asked the students to perform a simultaneous task—placing a series of letters in order based on their color by pressing the keys on a computer keyboard. This task was given under two conditions: when the students were memorizing the lists of words and when the students were recalling those lists for the researchers. The Missouri scientists discovered that concurrent tasks affected both memorizing and recalling. When the keyboard task was given while the students were trying to recall the previously memorized words, there was a 9 to 26 percent decline in their performance. The decline was even more if the concurrent task occurred while they were memorizing, in which case their performance decreased by 46 to 59 percent.",
		"In some subject areas, topics build on one another in a hierarchical fashion, so that a learner must almost certainly master one topic before moving to the next. For example, an elementary school student should probably master principles of addition before moving to multiplication, because multiplication is an extension of addition. Similarly, a medical student must have expertise in human anatomy before studying surgical techniques: It’s difficult to perform an appendectomy if you can’t find the appendix. Vertical transfer refers to such situations: A learner acquires new knowledge or skills by building on more basic information and procedures. In other cases, knowledge of one topic may affect learning a second topic even though the first isn’t a necessary condition for the second. Knowledge of French isn’t essential for learning Spanish, yet knowing French can help with Spanish because many words are similar in the two languages. When knowledge of the first topic is helpful but not essential to learning the second one, lateral transfer is occurring.",
		"In a set of remarkable experiments, Chen­Bo Zhong and Katie Liljenquist have shown that lyrics like “Wash your sins away in the tide” are not just a quirk of language. In their experiment, they asked students to recall either an ethical or unethical behavior in their past. Students who remembered their own unethical behavior were more likely to act as if they felt unclean. On a word­completion task that followed, the “unethical memory” students were more likely to say that the unfinished word “W＿＿H” was “WASH” instead of “WISH,” and the “S＿＿P” was “SOAP” instead of, say, “STEP.” In a second experiment, students were told that the study was to determine if handwriting was linked to personality. Some students copied out stories of ethical behavior; others, stories of unethical behavior. They were then asked to rate the desirability of various products. Some were cleansing products and others were not. Those who copied out unethical stories rated cleansing products much higher than noncleansing products.",
		"Perceptions of forest use and the value of forests as standing timber vary considerably from indigenous peoples to national governments and Western scientists. These differences in attitudes and values lie at the root of conflicting management strategies and stimulate protest groups such as the Chipko movement. For example, the cultivators of the Himalayas and Karakoram view forests as essentially a convertible resource. That is, under increasing population pressure and growing demands for cultivable land, the conversion of forest into cultivated terraces means a much higher productivity can be extracted from the same area. Compensation in the form of planting on terrace edges occurs to make up for the clearance. This contrasts with the national view of the value of forests as a renewable resource, with the need or desire to keep a forest cover over the land for soil conservation, and with a global view of protection for biodiversity and climate change purposes, irrespective of the local people’s needs.",
		"What lies behind the claim that so many people will take off to virtual worlds? Statistics show that the global market for video and computer game hardware and software today stands at about ten billion dollars annually and has risen continuously for the past several years. Digital games―the term that covers both video games and computer games―have long been the preserve of the young, but that distinction is fading. This is apparently not the sort of thing one gives up as one grows up; people born after 1980 seem to continue their gaming with more sophisticated and emotionally involved products. Consistent with this, industry statistics indicate that the average age of video gamers is rising by about one year each year. It is already in the thirties right now. People may change the kinds of games they are playing, but an interest in interactive entertainment media, once acquired, seems never to fade.",
		"Although Roman wine glasses were the height of technical and cultural sophistication in their time, compared to modern glasses they were crude. Their main problem was that they were full of bubbles. It seriously weakened the glass. Whenever a material experiences mechanical stress, which might be caused by anything from being clinked against another glass to being dropped accidentally on the floor, it absorbs the force by dispersing it from atom to atom, reducing the total force that each individual atom has to absorb. Any atom that can’t withstand the force being inflicted on it will be ripped from its position in the material, causing a crack. Wherever there is a bubble or crack, the atoms have fewer neighboring atoms to hold them in place and with which to share the force, and so these atoms are more prone to being ripped from position.",
		"It is widely believed that verbal rehearsal improves our memory. However, an experiment by Schooler and Engstler-Schooler suggests that is not the case. Participants in the study watched a film of a robbery where they saw a bank robber’s face. The experimental group of participants then gave as detailed a description of the face as they could for 5 minutes while the control group did something unrelated. Each participant then had to identify the robber from a line up of eight similar looking people. The participants in the control group, who performed an unrelated task for 5 minutes, picked the correct person from the line up 64% of the time. But the participants who had been recalling all they could of the suspect’s face picked the correct person just 38% of the time. Somehow, putting the details of the face into words interfered with the natural facial recognition at which we all usually excel. This effect is called verbal overshadowing.",
		"After the United Nations environmental conference in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 made the term “sustainability” widely known around the world, the word became a popular buzzword by those who wanted to be seen as pro-environmental but who did not really intend to change their behavior. It became a public relations term, an attempt to be seen as abreast with the latest thinking of what we must do to save our planet from widespread harm. But then, in a decade or so, some governments, industries, educational institutions, and organizations started to use the term in a serious manner. In the United States a number of large corporations appointed a vice president for sustainability. Not only were these officials interested in how their companies could profit by producing “green” products, but they were often given the task of making the company more efficient by reducing wastes and pollution and by reducing its carbon emissions.",
		"To find out whether basketball players shoot in streaks, researchers obtained the shooting records of the Philadelphia 76ers during the 1980-81 season. (The 76ers are the only team who keep records of the order in which a player’s hits and misses occurred, rather than simple totals.) The researchers then analyzed these data to determine whether players’ hits tended to cluster together more than one would expect by chance. Contrary to the expectations expressed by the researchers’ sample of fans, players were not more likely to make a shot after making their last one, two, or three shots than after missing their last one, two, or three shots. In fact, there was a slight tendency for players to shoot better after missing their last shot. They made 51% of their shots after making their previous shot, compared to 54% after missing their previous shot; 50% after making their previous two shots, compared to 53% after missing their previous two; 46% after making three in a row, compared to 56% after missing three in a row.",
		"Over the past few decades, architecture as an idea and practice has increasingly limited its definition of itself. In the foreseeable future, the instrumentality of architecture in effecting actual change―that is, change that challenges the dominance of commercial institutions, their aims, and values―will diminish. While the present day seems to be a time of unparalleled innovation and freedom of choice, the reality is that architectural styles and forms are often the attractive packaging and repackaging of the same proven, marketable concepts. The speed with which “radical” designs by celebrity architects achieve acceptance and popularity demonstrates that formal innovation has itself become an important commodity. However, beneath the cloak of radicalism, the conventions of existing building typologies and programs, with all their comforting familiarity, still rule―and sell. What is needed desperately today are approaches to architecture that can free its potential to transform our ways of thinking and acting.",
		"Color has not always been synonymous with truth and reality. In the past, Plato and Aristotle both attacked the use of color in painting because they considered color to be an ornament that obstructed the truth. Even the word “color” contains a snub against it. The Latin colorem is related to celare, to hide or conceal; in Middle English to color is to adorn, to disguise, to render plausible, to misrepresent. Today most people prefer color pictures to black­and­white pictures. They assert that color photographs are more “real” than black­and­white photographs. This implies that people tend to conflate color photography and reality to an even greater extent than they do with black­and­white photographs. Many people have had the experience of someone pointing to an 8×10­inch color photograph and saying, “There’s Mary. She sure looks good, doesn’t she?” We know that it is not Mary, but such a typical response acts as a vivid reminder of how we expect photography to duplicate our reality for us.",
		"Bringing a certain intellectual authority into a classroom does not need to silence the more insecure voices of the less confident students. Correcting the students requires a high level of sensitivity on the part of the teacher. It does not mean that there is no need to correct, but the correction should not lead to silencing the student. An authoritarian form of correction often prompts even the very brightest of students to withdraw from an uncomfortable situation, let alone those students who are less secure about their own intellectual potential. It also kills the willingness to entertain more risky interpretations. Instead of simply accepting any interpretation just for the sake of the freedom of expression, it is most advisable to question the student about how he/she arrived at their interpretation. This approach creates a community of thinkers, who demonstrate that what is at stake is not the superiority of the opinion based on the hierarchy of the author, but a realization that we belong together in our investigating the matter in question.",
		"Some environments are more likely to lead to fossilization and subsequent discovery than others. Thus, we cannot assume that more fossil evidence from a particular period or place means that more individuals were present at that time, or in that place. It may just be that the circumstances at one period of time, or at one location, were more favourable for fossilization than they were at other times, or in other places. Likewise, the absence of hominin fossil evidence at a particular time or place does not have the same implication as its presence. As the saying goes, ‘absence of evidence is not evidence of absence’. Similar logic suggests that taxa are likely to have arisen before they first appear in the fossil record, and they are likely to have survived beyond the time of their most recent appearance in the fossil record. Thus, the first appearance datum, and the last appearance datum of taxa in the hominin fossil record are likely to be conservative statements about the times of origin and extinction of a taxon.",
		"In 2010 scientists conducted a rat experiment. They locked a rat in a tiny cage, placed the cage within a much larger cell and allowed another rat to roam freely through that cell. The caged rat gave out distress signals, which caused the free rat also to exhibit signs of anxiety and stress. In most cases, the free rat proceeded to help her trapped companion, and after several attempts usually succeeded in opening the cage and liberating the prisoner. The researchers then repeated the experiment, this time placing chocolate in the cell. The free rat now had to choose between either liberating the prisoner, or enjoying the chocolate all by herself. Many rats preferred to first free their companion and share the chocolate (though a few behaved more selfishly, proving perhaps that some rats are meaner than others).",
		"Research from the Harwood Institute for Public Innovation in the USA shows that people feel that ‘materialism’ somehow comes between them and the satisfaction of their social needs. A report entitled Yearning for Balance, based on a nationwide survey of Americans, concluded that they were ‘deeply ambivalent about wealth and material gain’. A large majority of people wanted society to ‘move away from greed and excess toward a way of life more centred on values, community, and family’. But they also felt that these priorities were not shared by most of their fellow Americans, who, they believed, had become ‘increasingly atomized, selfish, and irresponsible’. As a result they often felt isolated. However, the report says, that when brought together in focus groups to discuss these issues, people were ‘surprised and excited to find that others share[d] their views’. Rather than uniting us with others in a common cause, the unease we feel about the loss of social values and the way we are drawn into the pursuit of material gain is often experienced as if it were a purely private ambivalence which cuts us off from others.",
		"People typically consider the virtual, or imaginative, nature of cyberspace to be its unique characteristic. Although cyberspace involves imaginary characters and events of a kind and magnitude not seen before, less developed virtual realities have always been integral parts of human life. All forms of art, including cave drawings made by our Stone Age ancestors, involve some kind of virtual reality. In this sense, cyberspace does not offer a totally new dimension to human life. What is new about cyberspace is its interactive nature and this interactivity has made it a psychological reality as well as a social reality. It is a space where real people have actual interactions with other real people, while being able to shape, or even create, their own and other people’s personalities. The move from passive imaginary reality to the interactive virtual reality of cyberspace is much more radical than the move from photographs to movies.",
		"The searchability of online works represents a variation on older navigational aids such as tables of contents, indexes, and concordances. But the effects are different. As with links, the ease and ready availability of searching make it much simpler to jump between digital documents than it ever was to jump between printed ones. Our attachment to any one text becomes more tenuous, more transitory. Searches also lead to the fragmentation of online works. A search engine often draws our attention to a particular snippet of text, a few words or sentences that have strong relevance to whatever we’re searching for at the moment, while providing little incentive for taking in the work as a whole. We don’t see the forest when we search the Web. We don’t even see the trees. We see twigs and leaves.",
		"There is a key difference between how humans and other intelligent animals learn. In a very telling experiment done by evolutionary psychologist Mike Tomasello at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, a puzzle box containing a treat is given to a human toddler and a chimpanzee. Neither is able to get the treat out. He then demonstrates a multistep process of pulling and pushing pegs that eventually releases the treat. Among the motions, he includes an obviously nonsensical step―patting his head three times before the last step. Both the toddler and the chimp are able to copy his actions and get the treat, but only the toddler includes the head-patting step. The chimp, seeing this is not relevant to getting the treat, omits it from the routine. The human, however, unquestioningly copies all the steps. The toddler trusts the human teaching her to have a reason for each step in this situation, and so she overcopies. In fact, the less clear the goal of the procedure, the more carefully and precisely the human child will imitate even irrelevant steps.",
		"The idea that planting trees could have a social or political significance appears to have been invented by the English, though it has since spread widely. According to Keith Thomas’s history Man and the Natural World, seventeenth- and eighteenth-century aristocrats began planting hardwood trees, usually in lines, to declare the extent of their property and the permanence of their claim to it. “What can be more pleasant,” the editor of a magazine for gentlemen asked his readers, “than to have the bounds and limits of your own property preserved and continued from age to age by the testimony of such living and growing witnesses?” Planting trees had the additional advantage of being regarded as a patriotic act, for the Crown had declared a severe shortage of the hardwood on which the Royal Navy depended.",
		"A basic principle in economics is that when the supply of something goes up, its price should go down. The puzzle was that in the twentieth century, there were prolonged periods where the reverse appeared to happen in the world of work. In some countries, there was huge growth in the number of high­skilled people pouring out of colleges and universities, yet their wages appeared to rise rather than fall compared to those without this education. How could this be? The supply of high­skilled workers did grow, pushing their wages downward, but new technologies were skill­biased and so caused the demand for high­skilled workers to soar. The latter effect was so great that it overcame the former, so even though there were more educated people looking for work, the demand for them was so strong that the amount they were paid still went up.",
		"The computer has, to a considerable extent, solved the problem of acquiring, preserving, and retrieving information. Data can be stored in effectively unlimited quantities and in manageable form. The computer makes available a range of data unattainable in the age of books. It packages it effectively; style is no longer needed to make it accessible, nor is memorization. In dealing with a single decision separated from its context, the computer supplies tools unimaginable even a decade ago. But it also diminishes perspective. Because information is so accessible and communication instantaneous, there is a diminution of focus on its significance, or even on the definition of what is significant. This dynamic may encourage policymakers to wait for an issue to arise rather than anticipate it, and to regard moments of decision as a series of isolated events rather than part of a historical continuum. When this happens, manipulation of information replaces reflection as the principal policy tool.",
		"Perhaps not surprisingly, given how long magicians have been developing their craft, a lot of creativity in magic is of the tweaking variety─some of the most skilled and inventive magicians gained fame by refining the execution of tricks that have been known for decades, or sometimes centuries. Nevil Maskelyne, one of magic’s old masters, claimed that “the difficulty of producing a new magical effect is about equivalent to that of inventing a new proposition in Euclid.” Whether it’s because there’s little that’s completely new, or for some other reason, magicians seem to worry less about imitation. They do, however, worry a lot about traitors─those magicians who expose the secrets behind a trick to the public. Once a trick is exposed in this way, its value as “magic” is destroyed, and this harms everyone in the industry. For this reason, magicians’ norms are focused mostly on punishing magicians who expose tricks to the public─ even if the trick is the exposer’s own invention.",
		"Why would languages and religions increase rapidly around the equator, and why is their frequency also related to ethnocentrism? The answer to these questions lies in the fact that pathogen density is much higher in the tropics than it is in temperate and cold climates. When you live in Sweden, chances are good that any group within five hundred miles has been exposed to the same few pathogens. In contrast, when you live in the Congo, the group on the other side of the valley may well have been exposed to a pathogen with which you’ve had no prior contact. For this reason, humans in the tropics learned that when they interacted with other groups they tended to get sick, so they would have stopped doing it. In a pre‑scientific world, it was logical to blame their neighbors for their illness, and therefore to dislike them. Dislike and fear kept neighbors apart, and once you don’t interact with others anymore, your languages and religions naturally divide as well.",
		"Martin Grunwald, leader of the Haptic Research Laboratory at the University of Leipzig, feels psychologists do not pay nearly enough attention to our sense of touch. With this in mind, he researched the way people spontaneously touch their faces. We all do it. You might be doing it right now while reading this. These movements are not for communication and, in most cases, we are not even aware of them. But that does not mean they serve no purpose, as Grunwald discovered. He measured the brain activity of test subjects while they tried to remember a sequence of haptic stimuli for five minutes. When he disturbed them with unpleasant noises, the subjects dramatically increased the rate at which they touched their faces. When the noises upset the rhythm of their brains and threatened to disrupt the subjects’ concentration, self-touch helped them get their concentration back on track. To put it another way: self-touch grounded their minds.",
		"Mobilities in transit offer a broad field to be explored by different disciplines in all faculties, in addition to the humanities. In spite of increasing acceleration, for example in travelling through geographical or virtual space, our body becomes more and more a passive non-moving container, which is transported by artefacts or loaded up with inner feelings of being mobile in the so-called information society. Technical mobilities turn human beings into some kind of terminal creatures, who spend most of their time at rest and who need to participate in sports in order to balance their daily disproportion of motion and rest. Have we come closer to Aristotle’s image of God as the immobile mover, when elites exercise their power to move money, things and people, while they themselves do not need to move at all? Others, at the bottom of this power, are victims of mobility-structured social exclusion. They cannot decide how and where to move, but are just moved around or locked out or even locked in without either the right to move or the right to stay.",
		"There is no question that losing weight is hard. According to one calculation, you must walk 35 miles or jog for seven hours to lose just one pound. One big problem with exercise is that we don’t track it very scrupulously. A study in America found that people overestimated the number of calories they burned in a workout by a factor of four. They also then consumed, on average, about twice as many calories as they had just burned off. As Daniel Lieberman noted in The Story of the Human Body, a worker on a factory floor will in a year expend about 175,000 more calories than a desk worker— equivalent to more than sixty marathons. That’s pretty impressive, but here’s a reasonable question: how many factory workers look as if they run a marathon every six days? To be cruelly blunt, not many. That’s because most of them, like most of the rest of us, replace all those burnt calories, and then some, when they are not working.",
		"A striving to demonstrate individual personality through designs should not be surprising. Most designers are educated to work as individuals, and design literature contains countless references to ‘the designer’. Personal flair is without doubt an absolute necessity in some product categories, particularly relatively small objects, with a low degree of technological complexity, such as furniture, lighting, small appliances, and housewares. In larger-scale projects, however, even where a strong personality exercises powerful influence, the fact that substantial numbers of designers are employed in implementing a concept can easily be overlooked. The emphasis on individuality is therefore problematic―rather than actually designing, many successful designer ‘personalities’ function more as creative managers. A distinction needs to be made between designers working truly alone and those working in a group. In the latter case, management organization and processes can be equally as relevant as designers’ creativity.",
		"Put a hamster on a wheel, and it will start running. Give the hamster a treat, and it will run even longer. Stop dispensing the treats, and the hamster will stop running—completely. The original motivation has thereby become extinguished. The school system has been taking advantage of this psychological feature by replacing young children’s natural curiosity and joy of discovery with praise, grades, and other short‑term performance boosters. As the story goes, there once was an old man who enjoyed watching sunsets from his porch. One day, a bunch of kids came over and started playing loudly in front of his house. The man asked the kids to move over, but they ignored him. Next day, the children came again. The man called them over, gave each one a nickel, and asked them to make as much noise as they possibly could—to which they happily obliged. The man kept regularly handing out coins, until one day he told the kids that he was no longer paying them. “Then we aren’t going to make noise for you,” the children announced— and left.",
		"The rise of large, industrial cities has had social consequences that are often known as urbanism. The city dissolves the informal controls of the village or small town. Most urban residents are unknown to one another, and most social interactions in cities occur between people who know each other only in specific roles, such as parking attendant, store clerk, or customer. Individuals became more free to live as they wished, and in ways that break away from social norms. In response, and because the high density of city living requires the pliant coordination of many thousands of people, urban societies have developed a wide range of methods to control urban behavior. These include regulations that control private land use, building construction and maintenance (to minimize fire risk), and the production of pollution and noise.",
		"Experiments suggest that animals, just like humans, tend to prefer exaggerated, supernormal stimuli, and that a preference can rapidly propel itself to extreme levels (peak shift effect). In one experiment, through food rewards rats were conditioned to prefer squares to other geometric forms. In the next step, a non-square rectangle was introduced and associated with an even larger reward than the square. As expected, the rats learned to reliably prefer the rectangle. Less predictable was the third part of the experiment. The rats were offered the opportunity to choose between the rectangle they already knew and associated with large rewards and another rectangle, the proportions of which were even more different from those of a square. Interestingly, rats picked this novel variant, without undergoing any reward-based conditioning in favor of it. A possible explanation is thus that they chose the larger difference from the original square (i.e., the exaggeration of non-squareness).",
		"The evolutionary process works on the genetic variation that is available. It follows that natural selection is unlikely to lead to the evolution of perfect, ‘maximally fit’ individuals. Rather, organisms come to match their environments by being ‘the fittest available’ or ‘the fittest yet’: they are not ‘the best imaginable’. Part of the lack of fit arises because the present properties of an organism have not all originated in an environment similar in every respect to the one in which it now lives. Over the course of its evolutionary history, an organism’s remote ancestors may have evolved a set of characteristics―evolutionary ‘baggage’―that subsequently constrain future evolution. For many millions of years, the evolution of vertebrates has been limited to what can be achieved by organisms with a vertebral column. Moreover, much of what we now see as precise matches between an organism and its environment may equally be seen as constraints: koala bears live successfully on Eucalyptus foliage, but, from another perspective, koala bears cannot live without Eucalyptus foliage.",
		"As a social species, should we not all be synchronized and therefore awake at the same time to promote maximal human interactions? Perhaps not. Humans likely evolved to co­sleep as families or even whole tribes, not alone or as couples. Appreciating this evolutionary context, the benefits of such genetically programmed variation in sleep/wake timing preferences can be understood. The night people in the group would not be going to sleep until one or two a.m., and not waking until nine or ten a.m. The morning people, on the other hand, would have retired for the night at nine p.m. and woken at five a.m. Consequently, the group as a whole is only collectively vulnerable (i.e., every person asleep) for just four rather than eight hours, despite everyone still getting the chance for eight hours of sleep. That’s potentially a 50 percent increase in survival fitness. Mother Nature would never pass on a biological trait— here, the useful variability in when individuals within a collective tribe go to sleep and wake up— that could enhance the survival safety and thus fitness of a species by this amount. And so she hasn’t.",
		"Research for historical fiction may focus on under-documented ordinary people, events, or sites. Fiction helps portray everyday situations, feelings, and atmosphere that recreate the historical context. Historical fiction adds “flesh to the bare bones that historians are able to uncover and by doing so provides an account that while not necessarily true provides a clearer indication of past events, circumstances and cultures.” Fiction adds color, sound, drama to the past, as much as it invents parts of the past. And Robert Rosenstone argues that invention is not the weakness of films, it is their strength. Fiction can allow users to see parts of the past that have never―for lack of archives―been represented. In fact, Gilden Seavey explains that if producers of historical fiction had strongly held the strict academic standards, many historical subjects would remain unexplored for lack of appropriate evidence. Historical fiction should, therefore, not be seen as the opposite of professional history, but rather as a challenging representation of the past from which both public historians and popular audiences may learn.",
		"Music has no past; it exists only at the moment when it happens, and no two performances are identical. This is music’s greatest asset because it brings out the essential ‘now’ without implications of a past and a potential future. Thus, Stravinsky pointed out that only through music are we able to ‘realize the present.’ Musical ‘meaning’ cannot be separated from the act of presentation. However, the necessity of present­ing music—making it present here and now, without which it will not be music at all—does not sit easily with a concept of education that rests mainly upon received factual knowledge and which, by tradition, uses the past to make sense of the present. If we want music to have a role in general education, it would seem logical to acknowledge this difference and give prominence to activities that will involve all pupils working directly with music. Yet, in spite of numerous attempts to develop a more musical music curriculum for the majority of school pupils, the emphasis is still on pupils absorbing factual information about music.",
		"“Brain plasticity” is a term we use in neuroscience. Whether intentionally or not, “plasticity” suggests that the key idea is to mold something once and keep it that way forever: to shape the plastic toy and never change it again. But that’s not what the brain does. It carries on remolding itself throughout your life. Think of a developing city, and note the way it grows, improves, and responds to the world around it. Observe where the city builds its truck stops, how it crafts its immigration policies, and how it modifies its education and legal systems. A city is always changing. A city is not designed by urban planners and then immobilized like a plastic object. It continually develops. Just like cities, brains never reach an end point. We spend our lives blossoming toward something, even as the target moves. Consider the feeling of encountering a diary that you wrote many years ago. It represents the thinking, opinions, and viewpoint of someone who was a bit different from who you are now, and that previous person can sometimes border on the unrecognizable. Despite having the same name and the same early history, in the years between inscription and interpretation the narrator has altered. The word “plastic” can be stretched to fit this notion of ongoing change.",
		"We have evolved the capacity to care for other people, animals and things. For example, if children are hurt, parents often know that rationalizing with them is not enough. The children will often need a cuddle and a bit of tender loving care. We recognize that other people often need looking after and caring for, and we have evolved the capacity to do this within our brains. We can empathize with others and feel sad for them and often want to help them. However, in depression, we often lose this inner capability. We often fail to look after or nurture ourselves, and we may not even recognize that we need to become more inwardly caring. To heal often means we have to learn to reactivate the caring‒ healing part of ourselves that depression has knocked out.",
		"All living languages change, but the rate of change varies from time to time and from language to language. For example, the modern Icelander does not find it very difficult to read the Icelandic sagas from the Middle Ages. This is because the rate of change in Icelandic has always been slow, ever since the country was ruled by Norwegians a thousand years ago and Icelandic history began. In contrast, the English find an English document of the year 1300 very difficult to understand unless they have special training. And an English document of the year 900 seems to them to be written in a foreign language. They may think, mistakenly, that it has no connection with Modern English.",
		"Observing a child’s play, particularly fantasy play, can be seen to provide particularly rich insights into a child’s inner world. Interpretation of what you have observed must, however, be made with care since the functions of play are complex and not fully understood. It would be unwise to jump to conclusions about what a child is communicating through it. Scenes a child acts out may give us clues about their past experiences, or their wishes for the future; these scenes may represent what has actually happened, what they wish would happen, or a confusion of events and feelings that they are struggling to make sense of. Therefore, we can say that observation is a valuable tool to understand a child, but one that should always be employed with caution.",
		"The old saying “Use it or lose it” is never more appropriate than when referring to flexibility. Children are generally very flexible, as noted when an infant chews on his toe or puts his foot behind his head. This flexibility, however, is usually short-lived unless the child remains active and engages in flexibility-related activities such as gymnastics or wrestling. As adults, we can lose flexibility rather rapidly unless we make a conscious effort to maintain it. In short, flexibility does not have to disappear with age, but it often does because of a simple lack of exercise.",
		"When we discuss the idea of responsibility, we need to make a distinction between responsibility and moral responsibility. Responsibility is when one takes on a task or burden and accepts the associated consequences. For example, if you take on the responsibility of organizing a conference for work, then you not only take on the task of organizing the event, but you are also taking on the responsibility of its outcome; whether it is a success or failure. This is responsibility. Moral responsibility, on the other hand, is responsibility based on one’s moral codes. Let’s say that none of the speakers can make the conference because of a big snowstorm. You are responsible for the success or failure of the conference, but you may not be morally responsible for its failure.",
		"Finding the perfect shoe fit may be difficult for some people. Most adults think they know their exact foot size, so they don’t measure their feet when buying new shoes. Therefore, many people squeeze into the same shoe size for years, or even decades. While feet stop growing in length by age twenty, most feet gradually widen with age, and sometimes women’s feet “grow” after the birth of a child. Besides, your feet can actually be different sizes at different times of the day, getting larger and returning to “normal” by the next morning. So, the next time you buy shoes, remember that your foot size can change.",
		"When you are anxious, the perceived threat potential of stimuli related to your anxiety can rise. Thus, things you typically encounter that might not usually trigger fear now do so. For example, if you encounter a snake in the course of a hike, even if no harm comes, anxiety is likely aroused, putting you on alert. If farther along the trail you notice a dark, slender, curved branch on the ground, an object you would normally ignore, you might now momentarily be likely to view it as a snake, triggering a feeling of fear. Similarly, if you live in a place where terror alerts are common, harmless stimuli can become potential threats. In New York City, when the alert level rises, a parcel or paper bag left under an empty subway seat can trigger much concern.",
		"Does parents’ physical touch communicate their love to the teenager? The answer is yes and no. It all depends on when, where, and how. For instance, a hug may be embarrassing if it’s done when a teenager is with his friends. It may cause the teenager to push the parent away or say, “Stop it.” However, massaging the teenager’s shoulders after he comes home from a game may deeply communicate love. A loving touch after a disappointing day at school will be welcomed as true parental love.",
		"One line of research suggests that how often you go over material is less critical than the depth of processing that you engage in. Thus, if you expect to remember what you read, you have to wrestle fully with its meaning. Many students could probably benefit if they spent less time on rote repetition and more on actually paying attention to and analyzing the meaning of their reading assignments. In particular, it is useful to make material personally meaningful. When you read your textbooks, try to relate information to your own life and experience. For example, if you’re reading in your psychology text about the personality trait of confidence, you can think about which people you know who are particularly confident and why you would characterize them as being that way.",
		"Suppose that you can choose only one item from a selection of desserts that includes pecan ice cream, doughnuts, chocolate chip cookies, and cheese cake. Select one of these at random─say, pecan ice cream. Then, out of all the other desserts, identify the one that you like best out of that group. In my case, it’d be chocolate chip cookies. My decision about which dessert to eat now is made by simply comparing how I feel about pecan ice cream with how I feel about chocolate chip cookies. To select the ice cream means not being able to eat the chocolate chip cookies. I’ll do that only if the pleasure from eating the ice cream exceeds the loss of giving up the chocolate chip cookies.",
		"Psychologists have noted a strong difference that separates Western from Chinese thought: the way each culture explains social events. Suppose, for example , that you see a person driving carelessly through a red traffic light. Westerners are more likely to criticize the person, assuming he generally cares little for the safety of others. In contrast, East Asians including Chinese are more likely to believe that the driver has been forced to drive fast because he’s in the midst of an emergency. Perhaps he’s transporting someone to the hospital, or perhaps he’s going to school to pick up a sick child. In other words, the person is behaving badly because he’s responding to the situation, and not because he’s irresponsible.",
		"If you ask someone to name three sports, most likely he or she will be able to answer with ease. After all, nearly everyone has an idea about what types of activities are regarded as sports and which are not. Most of us think we know what sports are. However, the line drawn between examples of sports, leisure, and play is not always clear. In fact, devising a definition that establishes clear and clean parameters around what types of activities should be included and excluded is relatively difficult to do. Activities that are regarded as play today may gain the status of sport in the future. For example, many people once played badminton in their backyards but this activity was hardly considered a sport. Since 1992, however, badminton has been an Olympic sport!",
		"One of the underlying principles of investing is based upon the relationship between risk and return. The risk associated with an investment can be defined as the probability of earning an expected profit. For example, if you deposit $1,000 into a savings account at your local bank, you would expect this to be a low-risk investment. Banks are generally conservative, and savings accounts are guaranteed by the federal government up to a certain dollar amount. If the bank promises to pay you a 2 percent annual interest rate, the chances are great that at the end of one year you will have $1,020. Thus, there is a high probability that you will earn a 2 percent annual profit, and this would be considered a low-risk investment.",
		"Fishing is the most obvious ocean­-based economic activity. People in many coastal areas make their living by fishing, and fish and shellfish make up a major part of their diet. In fact, about one billion people worldwide rely on fish as their main source of animal protein. In terms of fishing as an economic activity, the largest segment of world fisheries is commercial fishing. Fish caught by commercial fishermen include salmon, tuna, shellfish and other edible species such as squid. Consumers are used to buying these seafoods in grocery stores, restaurants, and village markets around the world. However, the supply is not infinite. As the world’s population swells, the demand for fishing products puts intense pressure on fish populations. The worldwide catch of ocean fish swelled from 81 million tons in 2003 to 148 million tons in 2010.",
		"There is a contrast principle in human perception that affects the way we see the difference between two things that are presented one after another. For example, each student in the psychophysics laboratory takes a turn sitting in front of three buckets of water-one cold, one at room temperature, and one hot. After placing one hand in the cold water and one in the hot water, the student is told to place both in the lukewarm water simultaneously. Then something surprising happens. Even though both hands are in the same bucket, the hand that was in the cold water feels as if it is now in the hot water, while the one in the hot water feels as if it is in cold water. The point is that the same thing can be made to seem very different, depending on the nature of the event that precedes it.",
		"Although the property of brain plasticity is most obvious during development, the brain remains changeable throughout the life span. It is evident that we can learn and remember information long after maturation. Furthermore, although it is not as obvious, the adult brain retains its capacity to be influenced by general experience. For example, being exposed to fine wine or Pavarotti changes ones later appreciation of wine and music, even if encountered in late adulthood. The adult brain is plastic in other ways, too. For instance, one of the characteristics of normal aging is that neurons die and are not replaced. This process begins in adolescence, yet most of us will not suffer any significant cognitive loss for decades because the brain compensates for the slow neuron loss by changing its structure. Similarly, although complete restoration of function is not possible, the brain has the capacity to change in response to injury in order to at least partly compensate for the damage.",
		"College students know that when they enter a classroom on the first day of class, they should not walk to the front of the room and give instructions to the class. Likewise, professors know that on the first day of class, students expect them to give an overview of the course and lay out expectations such as no texting during class. Usually, however, some room for negotiation exists; that is, the parties involved have the option of negotiating a social order. So on the first day of class, a professor may negotiate with students, indicating it is okay to check text messages when the professor is passing out assignments but not during lecture or class discussion. However, professors know that they cannot ‘negotiate’ a social order in which students pay money to receive a desired grade.",
		"Indeed, confusing people a little bit is beneficial―it is good for you and good for them. For example, imagine someone extremely punctual who comes home at exactly six o’clock every day for fifteen years. You can use his arrival to set your watch. The fellow will cause his family anxiety if he is barely a few minutes late. Someone with a slightly more unpredictable schedule, with, say, a half-hour variation, won’t do so. For similar reasons, stability is not good for the economy: firms become very weak during long periods of steady success without failure, and hidden vulnerabilities accumulate silently under the surface―so delaying crises is not a very good idea. Likewise, absence of ‘ups and downs’ in the market causes hidden risks to accumulate quietly. The longer one goes without a market trauma, the worse the damage when a real crisis occurs.",
		"My suggestion is to understand and make use of the changes in people’s strengths and weaknesses as they grow older. We can say that useful attributes tending to decrease with age include ambition, desire to compete, physical strength and endurance, and capacity for sustained mental concentration. Conversely, useful attributes tending to increase with age include experience of one’s field, understanding of people and relationships, and ability to help other people without one’s own ego getting in the way. These shifts in strengths result in many older workers choosing to devote more of their efforts to supervising, administering, advising, and teaching. For instance, my farmer friends in their 80s spend less time on horseback and on tractors, more time making strategic decisions about the business of farming; my older lawyer friends spend less time in court, more time mentoring younger lawyers.",
		"When there is a discrepancy between the verbal message and the nonverbal message, the latter typically weighs more in forming a judgment. For example, a friend might react to a plan for dinner with a comment like “that’s good,” but with little vocal enthusiasm and a muted facial expression. In spite of the verbal comment, the lack of expressive enthusiasm suggests that the plan isn’t viewed very positively. In such a case, the purpose of the positive comment might be to avoid a disagreement and support the friend, but the lack of a positive expression unintentionally leaks a more candid, negative reaction to the plan. Of course, the muted expressive display might also be strategic and intentional. That is, the nonverbal message is deliberate, but designed to let the partner know one’s candid reaction indirectly. It is then the partner’s responsibility to interpret the nonverbal message and make some adjustment in the plan.",
		"Imagine that you are French. You are walking along a busy pavement in Paris and another pedestrian is approaching from the opposite direction. A collision will occur unless you each move out of the other’s way. Which way do you step? The answer is almost certainly to the right. Replay the same scene in many parts of Asia, however, and you would probably move to the left. There is no instruction to head in a specific direction. Mehdi Moussaid says this is a behavior brought about by probabilities. If two opposing people guess each other’s intentions correctly, each moving to one side and allowing the other past, then they are likely to choose to move the same way the next time they need to avoid a collision. The chance of a successful maneuver increases as more and more people adopt a bias in one direction, until the tendency sticks. Whether it’s right or left does not matter; what does is that it is the unspoken will of the majority.",
		"Even the best journalists can be tricked by lies into presenting misleading news. Sometimes the lies are unconscious. Informants can think they are telling the truth but are really fooling themselves. They may report seeing what they wanted to see. For example, they report seeing a policeman arresting a youth when he was, in fact, giving the youth directions. You must check the facts, both for your own sake and for the sake of your informants, who would not wish to appear foolish. Sometimes, however, the informant is deliberately trying to trick you for his or her own reasons. Perhaps it is to cover up a mistake, perhaps to avoid appearing ignorant, occasionally to give false information for more sinister reasons, such as creating ill­feeling between groups or tricking people into giving money.",
		"The dog’s natural tendency to memorize landmarks can actually hinder training. Younger dogs are so good at learning locations that they often spontaneously memorize their surroundings as part of the set of cues that tells them to do something. For example, puppies taught the verbal command “sit” in a training class may appear to have forgotten it as soon as they get home―because, in addition to the command, they have spontaneously memorized as the relevant cue some feature of the room where the class was held and, in different surroundings, do not recognize the command. Therefore, many dog trainers repeat a training exercise in a variety of places, in order to break such associations and isolate the intended cue, in this case, the verbal command alone.",
		"In an astonishing example of how nurturing can influence nature, there is considerable evidence confirming that how parents emotionally respond to their children can encourage or suppress genetic tendencies. Biology is not destiny, so gene expression is not necessarily inevitable. To produce their effects, genes must be turned on. For example, shyness is a trait that seems to be partially hereditary. If parents are overprotective of their shy young daughter, the toddler is likely to remain shy. However, if they encourage her to interact with other toddlers, she may overcome it. Thus, genetic tendencies toward intelligence, sociability, and aggression can be stimulated, controlled, or suppressed by parental response and other environmental influences.",
		"From a broad range of early cultures, extending back to about a million years, natural objects began to be used as tools and implements to supplement or enhance the capacities of the hand. For example, the hand is capable of clawing soil to dig out an edible root, but a digging stick or clam shell is also capable of being grasped to do the job more easily, in a sustainable manner, reducing damage to fingers and nails. The task is made easier still if a shell is tied with fiber at a right angle to the end of a stick, to make a simple hoe. It can then be used more effectively in wider circles from an erect working position. Similarly, the hand can be cupped in order to drink water, but a deep shell forms the same shape permanently and more effectively to function without leakage as a dipper.",
		"Problems can be distinguished according to whether they are reasonable or unreasonable. Reasonable problems are of the kind that can be solved in a step-by-step manner. A crossword puzzle is of this nature. Given a sufficient vocabulary, the empty spaces can be filled in one by one. Unreasonable problems, in contrast, cannot be treated this way because the task contains some ‘trick’ or ‘catch’ that must be understood before someone can arrive at a solution. This feature frustrates any step-by-step process that proceeds without the realization that “things aren’t what they seem.” Hence, successful problem solving in these cases requires that the person acquire an insight into the nature of the trick. Riddles provide commonplace instances of such insight problems, such as the classic riddle that the Sphinx posed to Oedipus.",
		"Once most Americans got their water only from the tap. Now they often buy their water in bottles. But bottled water costs 80 cents to $4.00 per gallon, while tap water costs only pennies per day. Is the extra expense worth it? Although the FDA sets regulations specifically for bottled water to ensure that it is safe, the Environmental Protection Agency’s standards for tap water are actually higher. For example, bottled water is permitted to contain certain amounts of any bacteria. Tap water, in contrast, cannot contain any of the dangerous bacteria. Also, there are no federal filtration or disinfection requirements for bottled water, as there are for tap water. The chlorine used to treat tap water continues to kill harmful bacteria, while bottled water contains no such disinfectant to prevent bacterial growth. Furthermore, tap water is actually healthier in some respects. It usually contains fluoride, along with other minerals―such as calcium and iron―that are beneficial to the body.",
		"Feedback is usually most effective when you offer it at the earliest opportunity, particularly if your objective is to teach someone a skill. For example, if you are teaching your friend how to make your famous egg rolls, you provide a step-by-step commentary as you watch your pupil. If he makes a mistake, you don’t wait until the egg rolls are finished to tell him that he left out the cabbage. He needs immediate feedback to finish the rest of the sequence successfully. Sometimes, However, if a person is already sensitive and upset about something, delaying feedback can be wise. Use your critical thinking skills to analyze when feedback will do the most good. Rather than automatically offering immediate correction, use the just-in-time approach and provide feedback just before the person might make another mistake.",
		"Healthy living in individuals lays the foundation for healthy living throughout society and the world. For instance, healthy relationships depend upon healthy individuals sharing personally and working mutually to develop win­win agreements on how to grow and maintain the relationship. Similarly, healthy parenting depends upon healthy parents. Children learn the foundations of how the world works and how to develop their personal reality relative to the consciousness and behaviors of their parents. They model and subconsciously embrace much of their parents’ behavior, so it becomes their own. Thus, the beliefs and behaviors of parents provide psychological and social information to the children that function almost like food does for the body; in this case, the information helps build their personal realities and shape their behaviors. Consequently, psychological, social, as well as the physical diets provided by parents must all be healthy or the children learn to repeat the unhealthy patterns of their parents.",
		"For any product, the last step of the recycling process is selling the new product. Unfortunately, it can be hard to find markets for some types of recyclables. Plastic companies generally prefer new plastic, for instance, because it is of more consistent quality than recycled plastic. The new plastic is guaranteed to be free of incompatible polymers―the chemical from which plastics are made―that sometimes are mixed in when the plastic is not sorted well before recycling. Manufacturers say it is also easier to control the color of plastics that have no recycled content. Similarly, paper manufacturers complain that recycled paper often gets dirty during collection and sorting. The added expense of cleaning the paper makes it too expensive to use for some purposes.",
		"The idea of protecting intellectual activity and creation has deep roots. The ancient Greeks used an awards system to Recognize design achievements, which performed some of the same functions as the modern patent system. Their pottery, sculptures, and other manufactured goods had symbols on them to note the tradesmen who created them, which are the predecessors of modern trademarks. Similar marks and symbols functioning as trademarks have been found on Chinese pottery, possibly dating as far back as 2698 BCE, and in many other ancient societies, including the Egyptians, the Assyrians, and the Vedic civilization. The concept of intellectual property continued to develop during the Roman period. The Roman Empire had an incredible variety of trademarks. Roman potters alone used approximately 6,000 trademarks. Additionally, Roman authors had a sense that their intellectual creations were Valuable, as they complained about the exploitation of those creations. Their sense of injustice was probably heightened by the fact that there were laws and traditions in place that supported their belief that only they could exploit their creations. Roman authors could, in fact, make money from the copying and publishing of their works because the value of their intellectual creations was recognized.",
		"For almost every location in the world, there is an “optimal” temperature at which deaths are the lowest. On either side of this temperature—both when it gets colder and warmer—death rates increase. However, what the optimal temperature is is a different issue. If you live in Helsinki, your optimal temperature is about 59°F, whereas in Athens you do best at 75°F. The important point to notice is that the best temperature is typically very similar to the average summer temperature. Thus, the actual temperature will only rarely go above the optimal temperature, but very often it will be below. In Helsinki, the optimal temperature is typically exceeded only 18 days per year, whereas it is below that temperature a full 312 days. Research shows that although 55 extra people die each year from it being too hot in Helsinki, some 1,655 people die from it being too cold.",
		"Why did billions of dollars start flowing from governments and businesses into labs and universities? In academic circles, many are naive enough to believe in pure science. They believe that government and business altruistically give them money to pursue whatever research projects strike their fancy. But this hardly describes the realities of science funding. Most scientific studies are funded because somebody believes they can help attain some political, economic, or religious goal. For example, in the sixteenth century, kings and bankers channelled enormous resources to finance geographical expeditions around the world but not a penny for studying child psychology. This is because kings and bankers surmised that the discovery of new geographical knowledge would enable them to conquer new lands and set up trade empires, whereas they couldn’t see any profit in understanding child psychology. In the 1940s the governments of America and the Soviet Union channelled enormous resources to the study of nuclear physics rather than underwater archaeology. They surmised that studying nuclear physics would enable them to develop nuclear weapons, whereas underwater archaeology was unlikely to help win wars. Scientists themselves are not always aware of the political, economic, and religious interests that control the flow of money. Many scientists do, in fact, act out of pure intellectual curiosity. However, only rarely do scientists dictate the scientific agenda.",
		"Toys are cultural objects that children learn to play with in particular and culturally appropriate ways. Through participating in complex play, caregivers demonstrate traditional ways of object use. For example, when a mother models a telephone conversation during pretend play, she first dials the number, waits for a response, and only then begins to talk. If, while imitating the telephone conversation, the child forgets to dial the number, or mistakes the order of action, the mother may adjust the child’s actions, thus teaching the correct way of play. Parent-child object play is also a medium through which children practice real­life scenarios (e.g. doctor-patient, mother-baby). Children’s knowledge of cultural activities also contributes to the structure of parent-child play. When children play with familiar toys, they are more likely to facilitate pretend play, while parents serve as an audience. In contrast, when novel toys are used in the course of parent-child play, parents are more likely to start and organize the pretense.",
		"What’s happening when we’re actually doing two things at once? It’s simple. Our brain has channels, and so we’re able to process different kinds of data in different parts of our brain. Therefore, you can talk and walk at the same time. There is no channel interference. But you’re not really focused on both activities. One is happening in the foreground and the other in the background. If you were trying to explain on the cell phone how to operate a complex machine, you’d stop walking. Similarly, if you were crossing a rope bridge over a valley, you’d likely stop talking. You can do two things at once, but you can’t focus effectively on two things at once.",
		"Humans rely heavily on communicating through the meaning found in words and the way they are arranged. We can tell someone we love them in a sad, happy, or soft tone of voice, which gives nuance to our feelings―but the meaning of the words “I love you” remains the same. This is why “mixed signals” can be so confusing. For example, if a friend tells you that he or she likes you, you can interpret that in different ways, depending on the nonlanguage cues. If you hear “I like you” in a soft, upbeat tone and see your friend smiling and engaging you with friendly eye contact and body and arms relaxed, you will most likely believe that sentiment. However, if you hear “I like you” in an angry tone of voice while your friend exhibits no facial expression, avoids eye contact, and sits slightly turned away from you, with arms folded tightly, you would question his or her motive.",
		"To be persuaded by a message, you must pay attention to that message. This simple fact has led to the development of numerous procedures designed to attract attention, such as printing signs upside down or backwards, using vivid colors, and using unusual music and sounds. However, unless the sights and sounds are the message, the story does not end here. The audience must attend to the message that accompanies these attention­getters. Therefore, the message itself must be powerful enough to command attention. If we continue to attend to the unusual sights and sounds and never hear the message, persuasion will not occur. If the music is too catchy, for example, we may remember the music and not the product that is being advertised.",
		"When it comes to salt and sweets, there’s little a parent can do to change a child’s inborn desire for them, which begins early in infancy. However, there is some evidence that early diet can at least change the circumstances in which children will seek out sweet and salty flavors. As early as six months of age, babies who have been exposed more often to salted food show a stronger preference for salted cereal than babies with less salt experience. Similarly, six­ month­ old babies who have been fed sugar water tend to drink more of it than babies not previously exposed to it. This effect lasts a surprisingly long time, because even if the parents stop giving their baby sugar water by six months of age, she will continue to show a greater preference for it at age two.",
		"Generally, during a complex negotiation, Westerners divide the large tasks up into smaller ones. One can move through the smaller tasks, finishing one and moving on to the next, sensing accomplishment along the way. Issues are resolved at each step in the process, and the final agreement is the sum of the sequence. However, in Eastern thinking, all issues are discussed, often with no apparent order, and compromises, when made, occur at the conclusion of negotiations. The Western approach is sequential and the Eastern is holistic―the two worlds are apart. Therefore, American negotiators have difficulty measuring progress during negotiations with the Japanese, and the differences in the thinking and decision-making processes can result in misunderstandings.",
		"When we examine individual behavior and the impact of perception on that behavior, it is important to remember that people see what they either want to see or are trained to see. Therefore, in terms of human relations, the manager must try to understand the worker’s perception of reality. Employees willingly accept management’s methods only when they perceive those methods to be in the employees’ best interests. Otherwise, they will resort to such perceptual traps as selective perception and stereotyping. For example, Harvey Lester, a new employee, has been having trouble mastering his new job. His boss, Lois, tells him that if he does not improve, she will have to let him go. Feeling that he is on the verge of being fired, Harvey quits. What Lois saw as a mild warning designed to improve output is interpreted as a threat resulting in a resignation. Each party interpreted the action differently.",
		"New media can be defined by four characteristics simultaneously: they are media at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries which are both integrated and interactive and use digital code and hypertext as technical means. It follows that their most common alternative names are multimedia, interactive media and digital media. By using this definition, it is easy to identify media as old or new. For example, traditional television is integrated as it contains images, sound and text, but it is not interactive or based on digital code. The plain old telephone was interactive, but not integrated as it only transmitted speech and sounds and it did not work with digital code. In contrast, the new medium of interactive television adds interactivity and digital code. Additionally, the new generations of mobile or fixed telephony are fully digitalized and integrated as they add text, pictures or video and they are connected to the Internet.",
		"Duration refers to the time that events last. If we think of tempo as the speed of events, then duration is the speed of the clock itself. For the physicist, the duration of a “second” is precise and unambiguous: it is equal to 9,192,631,770 cycles of the frequency associated with the transition between two energy levels of the isotope cesium-133. In the realm of psychological experience, however, quantifying units of time is a considerably clumsier operation. When people are removed from the cues of “real” time─be it the sun, bodily fatigue, or timepieces themselves─it doesn’t take long before their time sense breaks down. And it is this usually imprecise psychological clock, as opposed to the time on one’s watch, that creates the perception of duration that people experience. Theoretically, a person who mentally stretches the duration of time should experience a slower tempo. Imagine, for example, that baseballs are pitched to two different batters. The balls are thrown every 5 seconds for 50 seconds, so a total of 10 balls are thrown. We now ask both batters how much time has passed. Let’s say that batter number one (who loves hitting) feels the duration to be 40 seconds. Batter number two (bored by baseball) believes it to be 60 seconds. Psychologically, then, the first person has experienced baseballs approaching every four seconds while the second sees it as every six seconds. The perceived tempo, in other words, is faster for batter number one.",
		"Early native Americans had to make everything they needed. The kinds of things each tribe used to make tools, clothing, toys, shelter, and food depended upon what they found around them. Also, the things they made fit their life style. For example, the people of the Plains, who traveled a lot, didn’t make clay pots. Pots were too heavy and broke too easily when they were moved, so they made containers from animal skins.",
		"The simplest way to define the role of the media agency is to take an analogy from fishing. The media agency must help businesses advertise their products. ‘Fish where the fish are’ is a maxim which applies to all areas of marketing. The ‘fish’, in the analogy, are the target market. It is common sense for fishermen to go where the fish are, or they won’t catch anything. Likewise, companies will get nowhere marketing in media where none of their target market will see the advertisements. Finding the best place to find the fish is the first strategic role of the media agency.",
		"When the Muslims invaded southern Europe in the eighth century, they passed a law forbidding the sale of pork. This was done because the founder of the Muslim religion had declared pork to be unclean. This law, of course, didn’t change the Europeans’ love of pork, and there soon developed a black market for the meat. In secret transactions, usually conducted at night, farmers would sell to city dwellers pigs concealed in large bags. Occasionally, a dishonest farmer would trick a buyer by selling a bag containing not a pig but a cat. If something went wrong and the bag came open during the transaction, this literally “let the cat out of the bag” and this is why revealing a secret is said to be “letting the cat out of the bag.”",
		"Feynman explains that light always takes the path of least time from point to point, and he uses the analogy of a lifeguard racing along a beach to save a drowning swimmer. The lifeguard could run straight to the water’s edge and then swim diagonally along the coast and out to sea, but this would result in a long time spent swimming, which is slower than running on the beach. Alternatively, he could run to the water’s edge at the point nearest to the swimmer, and dive in there. But this makes the total distance covered longer than it needs to be. The optimum, if his aim is to reach the swimmer as quickly as possible, is somewhere in between these two extremes. Light, too, takes such a path of least time from point to point, which is why it bends when passing between different materials.",
		"Hiding behind a barrier is a normal response we learn at an early age to protect ourselves. As children, we hid behind solid objects such as furniture or our mother’s skirt whenever we found ourselves in a threatening situation. As we grew older, this hiding behavior became more sophisticated. As adults, we fold one or both arms across the chest in an unconscious attempt to block out what we perceive as a threat or undesirable circumstances. Women’s use of arm barriers is less noticeable than men’s because women can grasp on to things like handbags or purses.",
		"Globalization has resulted in a global brain drain, which refers to the situation in which countries lose their best educated workers. A report released by the Arab League in 2009 found that roughly 100,000 scientists, doctors, and engineers were leaving countries in the Middle East and North Africa every year, with most of the scientists and doctors never returning. Another study suggested that vast numbers of developing countries’ doctors were working abroad, including 41% from Jamaica and 30% from Ghana. The brain drain has even worried some wealthy countries. The government of New Zealand, for instance, launched a program in 2006 to try to attract its professionals living abroad back home.",
		"Music study enriches all the learning―in reading, math, and other subjects―that children do at school. It also helps to develop language and communication skills. As children grow, musical training continues to help them develop the discipline and self­confidence needed to achieve in school. The day­to­day practice in music, along with setting goals and reaching them, develops self­discipline, patience, and responsibility. That discipline carries over to other areas, such as doing homework and other school projects on time and keeping materials organized.",
		"People are cautioned not to look at the Sun at the time of a solar eclipse because the brightness and the ultraviolet light of direct sunlight are damaging to the eyes. This good advice is often misunderstood by those who think that sunlight is more damaging at this special time. But staring at the Sun when it is high in the sky is harmful whether or not an eclipse occurs. In fact, staring at the bare Sun is more harmful than when part of the Moon blocks it. The reason for special caution at the time of an eclipse is simply that more people are interested in looking at the Sun during this time.",
		"The water that is embedded in our food and manufactured products is called “virtual water.” For example, about 265 gallons of water is needed to produce two pounds of wheat. So, the virtual water of these two pounds of wheat is 265 gallons. Virtual water is also present in dairy products, soups, beverages, and liquid medicines. Every day, humans consume lots of virtual water and the content of virtual water varies according to products. For instance, to produce two pounds of meat requires about 5 to 10 times as much water as to produce two pounds of vegetables.",
		"In an experiment, when people were asked to count three minutes in their heads, 25­year­olds were quite accurate, but 65­year­olds went over on average by 40 seconds. Time seemed to pass faster for the older group. This may seem meaningless, but there are a lot of benefits to perceiving time like 65­year­olds. For example, if you have been working on a project for eight hours, but it only feels like six, you will have more energy to keep going. If you have been running for 20 minutes, and you perceive it to be only 13 minutes, you’re more likely to have seven more minutes of energy. So, if you want to use your energy to work longer, just change your perception of how long you have been working.",
		"A snowy owl’s ears are not visible from the outside, but it has incredible hearing. The feathers on a snowy owl’s face guide sounds to its ears, giving it the ability to hear things humans cannot. Each of its ears is a different size, and one is higher than the other. The differing size and location of each ear helps the owl distinguish between sounds. It can hear at the same time the distant hoofbeats of a large deer, the flap of a bird’s wings above it, and the digging of a small animal below it. After choosing which sound interests it most, the snowy owl moves its head like a large circular antenna to pick up the best reception.",
		"Asians and many Native American cultures view silence as an important and appropriate part of social interaction. Speakers from these cultures often use some moments of silence before offering a response to another speaker. Such initial silence conveys the listener’s respect for the speaker; it indicates that the listener has heard the speaker’s words and is giving them due thought. Silence is viewed as a time to learn, to think about, and to review what the speaker has said. In cultures that prize silence, responding too quickly after speakers have finished their turns is interpreted as having devoted inadequate attention and consideration to speakers’ words and thoughts.",
		"Today car sharing movements have appeared all over the world. In many cities, car sharing has made a strong impact on how city residents travel. Even in strong car­ownership cultures such as North America, car sharing has gained popularity. In the U.S. and Canada, membership in car sharing now exceeds one in five adults in many urban areas. Strong influence on traffic jams and pollution can be felt from Toronto to New York, as each shared vehicle replaces around 10 personal cars. City governments with downtown areas struggling with traffic jams and lack of parking lots are driving the growing popularity of car sharing.",
		"I have seen many companies rush their products or services to market too quickly. There are many reasons for taking such an action, including the need to recover costs or meet deadlines. The problem with moving too quickly, however, is that it has a harmful impact on the creative process. Great ideas, like great wines, need proper aging: time to bring out their full flavor and quality. Rushing the creative process can lead to results that are below the standard of excellence that could have been achieved with additional time.",
		"Studying history can make you more knowledgeable or interesting to talk to or can lead to all sorts of brilliant vocations, explorations, and careers. But even more importantly, studying history helps us ask and answer humanity’s Big Questions. If you want to know why something is happening in the present, you might ask a sociologist or an economist. But if you want to know deep background, you ask historians. That’s because they are the people who know and understand the past and can explain its complex interrelationships with the present.",
		"In 2006, 81% of surveyed American shoppers said that they considered online customer ratings and reviews important when planning a purchase. Though an online comment—positive or negative—is not as powerful as a direct interpersonal exchange, it can be very important for a business. Many people depend on online recommendations. And young people rely heavily on them and are very likely to be influenced by the Internet when deciding what movie to see or what album to purchase. These individuals often have wide­reaching social networks and communicate regularly with dozens of others—with the potential to reach thousands. It has been reported that young people aged six to 24 influence about 50% of all spending in the US.",
		"Of the many forest plants that can cause poisoning, wild mushrooms may be among the most dangerous. This is because people sometimes confuse the poisonous and edible varieties, or they eat mushrooms without making a positive identification of the variety. Many people enjoy hunting wild species of mushrooms in the spring season, because they are excellent edible mushrooms and are highly prized. However, some wild mushrooms are dangerous, leading people to lose their lives due to mushroom poisoning. To be safe, a person must be able to identify edible mushrooms before eating any wild one.",
		"Water is the ultimate commons. Once, watercourses seemed boundless and the idea of protecting water was considered silly. But rules change. Time and again, communities have studied water systems and redefined wise use. Now Ecuador has become the first nation on Earth to put the rights of nature in its constitution. This move has proclaimed that rivers and forests are not simply property but maintain their own right to flourish. According to the constitution, a citizen might file suit on behalf of an injured watershed, recognizing that its health is crucial to the common good. More countries are acknowledging nature’s rights and are expected to follow Ecuador’s lead.",
		"Wouldn’t it be nice if you could take your customers by the hand and guide each one through your store while pointing out all the great products you would like them to consider buying? Most people, however, would not particularly enjoy having a stranger grab their hand and drag them through a store. Rather, let the store do it for you. Have a central path that leads shoppers through the store and lets them look at many different departments or product areas. This path leads your customers from the entrance through the store on the route you want them to take all the way to the checkout.",
		"Public speaking is audience centered because speakers “listen” to their audiences during speeches. They monitor audience feedback, the verbal and nonverbal signals an audience gives a speaker. Audience feedback often indicates whether listeners understand, have interest in, and are ready to accept the speaker’s ideas. This feedback assists the speaker in many ways. It helps the speaker know when to slow down, explain something more carefully, or even tell the audience that she or he will return to an issue in a question­and­answer session at the close of the speech. Audience feedback assists the speaker in creating a respectful connection with the audience.",
		"Words like ‘near’ and ‘far’ can mean different things depending on where you are and what you are doing. If you were at a zoo, then you might say you are ‘near’ an animal if you could reach out and touch it through the bars of its cage. Here the word ‘near’ means an arm’s length away. If you were telling someone how to get to your local shop, you might call it ‘near’ if it was a five­minute walk away. Now the word ‘near’ means much longer than an arm’s length away. Words like ‘near’, ‘far’, ‘small’, ‘big’, ‘hot’, and ‘cold’ all mean different things to different people at different times.",
		"Many of us live our lives without examining why we habitually do what we do and think what we think. Why do we spend so much of each day working? Why do we save up our money? If pressed to answer such questions, we may respond by saying “because that’s what people like us do.” But there is nothing natural, necessary, or inevitable about any of these things; instead, we behave like this because the culture we belong to compels us to. The culture that we inhabit shapes how we think, feel, and act in the most pervasive ways. It is not in spite of our culture that we are who we are, but precisely because of it.",
		"Training and conditioning for baseball focuses on developing strength, power, speed, quickness and flexibility. Before the 1980s, strength training was not an important part of conditioning for a baseball player. People viewed baseball as a game of skill and technique rather than strength, and most managers and coaches saw strength training as something for bodybuilders, not baseball players. They feared that weight lifting and building large muscles would cause players to lose flexibility and interfere with quickness and proper technique. Today, though, experts understand the importance",
		"Paying attention to some people and not others doesn’t mean you’re being dismissive or arrogant. It just reflects a hard fact: there are limits on the number of people we can possibly pay attention to or develop a relationship with. Some scientists even believe that the number of people with whom we can continue stable social relationships might be limited naturally by our brains. Professor Robin Dunbar has explained that our minds are only really capable of forming meaningful relationships with a maximum of about a hundred and fifty people. Whether that’s true or not, it’s safe to assume that we can’t be real friends with everyone.",
		"Given the widespread use of emoticons in electronic communication, an important question is whether they help Internet users to understand emotions in online communication. Emoticons, particularly character‒based ones, are much more ambiguous relative to face‒to‒face cues and may end up being interpreted very differently by different users. Nonetheless, research indicates that they are useful tools in online text‒based communication. One study of 137 instant messaging users revealed that emoticons allowed users to correctly understand the level and direction of emotion, attitude, and attention expression and that emoticons were a definite advantage in non‒verbal communication. Similarly, another study showed that emoticons were useful in strengthening the intensity of a verbal message, as well as in the expression of sarcasm.",
		"In a single week, the sun delivers more energy to our planet than humanity has used through the burning of coal, oil, and natural gas through all of human history. And the sun will keep shining on our planet for billions of years. Our challenge isn’t that we’re running out of energy. It’s that we have been focused on the wrong source―the small, finite one that we’re using up. Indeed, all the coal, natural gas, and oil we use today is just solar energy from millions of years ago, a very tiny part of which was preserved deep underground. Our challenge, and our opportunity, is to learn to efficiently and cheaply use the much more abundant source that is the new energy striking our planet each day from the sun.",
		"The Barnum Effect is the phenomenon where someone reads or hears something very general but believes that it applies to them. These statements appear to be very personal on the surface but in fact, they are true for many. Human psychology allows us to want to believe things that we can identify with on a personal level and even seek information where it doesn’t necessarily exist, filling in the blanks with our imagination for the rest. This is the principle that horoscopes rely on, offering data that appears to be personal but probably makes sense to countless people. Since the people reading them want to believe the information so badly, they will search for meaning in their lives that make it true.",
		"Today’s music business has allowed musicians to take matters into their own hands. Gone are the days of musicians waiting for a gatekeeper (someone who holds power and prevents you from being let in) at a label or TV show to say they are worthy of the spotlight. In today’s music business, you don’t need to ask for permission to build a fanbase and you no longer need to pay thousands of dollars to a company to do it. Every day, musicians are getting their music out to thousands of listeners without any outside help. They simply deliver it to the fans directly, without asking for permission or outside help to receive exposure or connect with thousands of listeners.",
		"Health and the spread of disease are very closely linked to how we live and how our cities operate. The good news is that cities are incredibly resilient. Many cities have experienced epidemics in the past and have not only survived, but advanced. The nineteenth and early­twentieth centuries saw destructive outbreaks of cholera, typhoid, and influenza in European cities. Doctors such as Jon Snow, from England, and Rudolf Virchow, of Germany, saw the connection between poor living conditions, overcrowding, sanitation, and disease. A recognition of this connection led to the replanning and rebuilding of cities to stop the spread of epidemics. In the mid­nineteenth century, London’s pioneering sewer system, which still serves it today, was built as a result of understanding the importance of clean water in stopping the spread of cholera.",
		"The Zeigarnik effect is commonly referred to as the tendency of the subconscious mind to remind you of a task that is incomplete until that task is complete. Bluma Zeigarnik was a Lithuanian psychologist who wrote in the 1920s about the effects of leaving tasks incomplete. She noticed the effect while watching waiters serve in a restaurant. The waiters would remember an order, however complicated, until the order was complete, but they would later find it difficult to remember the order. Zeigarnik did further studies giving both adults and children puzzles to complete then interrupting them during some of the tasks. The results showed that both adults and children remembered the tasks that hadn’t been completed because of the interruptions better than the ones that had been completed.",
		"Internet activist Eli Pariser noticed how online search algorithms encourage our human tendency to grab hold of everything that confirms the beliefs we already hold, while quietly ignoring information that doesn’t match those beliefs. We set up a so-called “filter-bubble” around ourselves, where we are constantly exposed only to that material that we agree with. We are never challenged, never giving ourselves the opportunity to acknowledge the existence of diversity and difference. In the best case, we become naive and sheltered, and in the worst, we become radicalized with extreme views, unable to imagine life outside our particular bubble. The results are disastrous: intellectual isolation and the real distortion that comes with believing that the little world we create for ourselves is the world.",
		"Who hasn’t used a cup of coffee to help themselves stay awake while studying? Mild stimulants commonly found in tea, coffee, or sodas possibly make you more attentive and, thus, better able to remember. However, you should know that stimulants are as likely to have negative effects on memory as they are to be beneficial. Even if they could improve performance at some level, the ideal doses are currently unknown. If you are wide awake and well­rested, mild stimulation from caffeine can do little to further improve your memory performance. Indeed, if you have too much of a stimulant, you will become nervous, find it difficult to sleep, and your memory performance will suffer.",
		"According to Marguerite La Caze, fashion contributes to our lives and provides a medium for us to develop and exhibit important social virtues. Fashion may be beautiful, innovative, and useful; we can display creativity and good taste in our fashion choices. And in dressing with taste and care, we represent both self­respect and a concern for the pleasure of others. There is no doubt that fashion can be a source of interest and pleasure which links us to each other. That is, fashion provides a sociable aspect along with opportunities to imagine oneself differently ―to try on different identities.",
		"The fast­paced evolution of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) has radically transformed the dynamics and business models of the tourism and hospitality industry. This leads to new levels/forms of competitiveness among service providers and transforms the customer experience through new services. Creating unique experiences and providing convenient services to customers leads to satisfaction and, eventually, customer loyalty to the service provider or brand (i.e., hotels). In particular, the most recent technological boost received by the tourism sector is represented by mobile applications. Indeed, empowering tourists with mobile access to services such as hotel reservations, airline ticketing, and recommendations for local attractions generates strong interest and considerable profits.",
		"Developing a personal engagement with poetry brings a number of benefits to you as an individual, in both a personal and a professional capacity. Writing poetry has been shown to have physical and mental benefits, with expressive writing found to improve immune system and lung function, diminish psychological distress, and enhance relationships. Poetry has long been used to aid different mental health needs, develop empathy, and reconsider our relationship with both natural and built environments. Poetry is also an incredibly effective way of actively targeting the cognitive development period, improving your productivity and scientific creativity in the process. In short, poetry has a lot to offer, if you give it the opportunity to do so.",
		"Whose story it is affects what the story is. Change the main character, and the focus of the story must also change. If we look at the events through another character’s eyes, we will interpret them differently. We’ll place our sympathies with someone new. When the conflict arises that is the heart of the story, we will be praying for a different outcome. Consider, for example, how the tale of Cinderella would shift if told from the viewpoint of an evil stepsister. Gone with the Wind is Scarlett O’Hara’s story, but what if we were shown the same events from the viewpoint of Rhett Butler or Melanie Wilkes?",
		"Although technology has the potential to increase productivity, it can also have a negative impact on productivity. For example, in many office environments workers sit at desks with computers and have access to the internet. They are able to check their personal e­mails and use social media whenever they want to. This can stop them from doing their work and make them less productive. Introducing new technology can also have a negative impact on production when it causes a change to the production process or requires workers to learn a new system. Learning to use new technology can be time consuming and stressful for workers and this can cause a decline in productivity.",
		"Sensory nerves have specialized endings in the tissues that pick up a particular sensation. If, for example, you step on a sharp object such as a pin, nerve endings in the skin will transmit the pain sensation up your leg, up and along the spinal cord to the brain. While the pain itself is unpleasant, it is in fact acting as a protective mechanism for the foot. Within the brain, nerves will connect to the area that controls speech, so that you may well shout ‘ouch’ or something rather less polite. They will also connect to motor nerves that travel back down the spinal cord, and to the muscles in your leg that now contract quickly to lift your foot away from the painful object. Sensory and motor nerves control almost all functions in the body—from the beating of the heart to the movement of the gut, sweating and just about everything else.",
		"In statistics, the law of large numbers describes a situation where having more data is better for making predictions. According to it, the more often an experiment is conducted, the closer the average of the results can be expected to match the true state of the world. For instance, on your first encounter with the game of roulette, you may have beginner’s luck after betting on 7. But the more often you repeat this bet, the closer the relative frequency of wins and losses is expected to approach the true chance of winning, meaning that your luck will at some point fade away. Similarly, car insurers collect large amounts of data to figure out the chances that drivers will cause accidents, depending on their age, region, or car brand. Both casinos and insurance industries rely on the law of large numbers to balance individual losses.",
		"A group of psychologists studied individuals with severe mental illness who experienced weekly group music therapy, including singing familiar songs and composing original songs. The results showed that the group music therapy improved the quality of participants’ life, with those participating in a greater number of sessions experiencing the greatest benefits. Focusing on singing, another group of psychologists reviewed articles on the efficacy of group singing as a mental health treatment for individuals living with a mental health condition in a community setting. The findings showed that, when people with mental health conditions participated in a choir, their mental health and wellbeing significantly improved. Group singing provided enjoyment, improved emotional states, developed a sense of belonging and enhanced self­confidence.",
		"When you take a step, cross your legs, or bend to tie your shoe, your knees are working hard. Your knees take a great deal of stress every day, and you need to take good care of them. To increase your knee strength, you should boost the surrounding muscles, which act as a support system. You can strengthen these muscles by doing exercises such as knee extensions. Maintaining a healthy weight and wearing proper footwear while walking or jogging will also help you maintain healthy knee joints.",
		"Our primary sense is vision, occupying up to one­third of our brain. A dog’s brain, however, is centered on smell. It holds at least 20 times more olfactory neurons than the human brain. According to San Diego animal behaviorist Dennis Fetko, the best man­made instruments for smell can detect a chemical in amounts as small as one trillionth of a gram. But a bloodhound dog can detect from a distance what the instruments cannot detect at the source! It is believed that a bloodhound can accurately follow a trail by nose for more than 100 miles.",
		"Though efficiency is a great virtue, it is not the only economic goal of interest to the society. Economic fairness is also crucial. Fairness refers to the distribution of income and well­being, as well as to the ways that government treats its citizens. Most people would regard as unfair a market equilibrium in which some individuals are super­rich while others are dying of extreme poverty. In such a circumstance, most people would regard it as fair for the government to tax the super­rich in order to provide basic resources for the poor. Indeed, a solid 63 percent of Americans agree that “It is the responsibility of government to take care of people who can’t take care of themselves.”",
		"The same media that serve and reflect the rise of personal preference—movies, television, photography, music, advertising, art, and others—often produce place images. Place, portrayer, and medium interact to produce the image, which, in turn, colors our perception of and beliefs about places and regions we have never visited. The images may be inaccurate or misleading, but they nevertheless create a world in our minds that has an array of unique places and place meanings. Our decisions about tourism and migration can be influenced by these images. For example, through the media, Hawaii has become in the American mind a sort of earthly paradise, a tourist destination with happy, invariably good­looking natives who live in a setting of natural beauty.",
		"One of the easiest ways to be likeable and win others over is to offer a sincere compliment. Developing awareness of others will help you notice things about them to compliment. The key is to put your own self-centered thoughts aside and become genuinely interested in other people. When you give people a genuine, sincere compliment about a trait or accomplishment, you’ve given them a valuable gift. You make them feel valued, acknowledged, and important. When people feel this way, their self-esteem goes up, they like themselves more, and because of this, they find you likeable.",
		"On the surface, some products are easier to sell online than others. For instance, anything that can be delivered in a digital format is likely to do well online and we have already seen the decline of traditional record shops and photo processors. However, there are many products which benefit from being touched or experienced in some way before being purchased. Thus a customer may wish to test-drive a new car before buying it or feel the weight of a piece of furniture to assess its solidity. Michael de Kare-Silver suggests that a product’s propensity to online selling depends to a certain degree on which of the five senses it appeals to. Thus, products which are sold on the basis of sight or sound alone can be sold online relatively easily, whereas those appealing to the senses of touch, taste, or smell cannot.",
		"Human beings have always had the capacity to think spatially―this is here, that is there―even though not everybody chooses to express this understanding in mapmaking. The capacity to form mental maps must have been essential for the early humans. Hunter­gatherers, for instance, recognized the routes of the migratory animals and the best places to hunt them down even without a physical map. Wandering tribesmen needed to know how they could cross deserts safely without dying of thirst. All these people would have carried a map of their land in their head.",
		"Black ice refers to a thin coating of glazed ice on a surface. While not truly black, it is virtually transparent, allowing black asphalt roadways or the surface below to be seen through it—hence the term “black ice”. Black ice is often practically invisible to drivers or persons stepping on it. There is, thus, a risk of sudden sliding and subsequent accidents. On December 1, 2013, heavy post­Thanksgiving weekend traffic encountered black ice on the westbound I-290 expressway in Worcester, Massachusetts. A chain reaction series of crashes resulted, involving three tractor­trailers and over 60 other vehicles.",
		"It is impossible to imagine a modern city without glass. On the one hand, we expect our buildings to protect us from the weather: this is what they are for, after all. And yet, faced with a prospective new home or place of work, one of the first questions people ask is: how much natural light is there? The glass buildings that rise every day in a modern city are the engineering answer to these conflicting desires: to be at once sheltered from the wind, the cold, and the rain, to be secure from intrusion and thieves, but not to live in darkness. The life we lead indoors, which for many of us is the vast majority of our time, is made light and delightful by glass.",
		"“To name is to call into existence―to call out of nothingness,” wrote French philosopher Georges Gusdorf. Words give you a tool to create how you perceive the world by naming and labeling what you experience. You undoubtedly learned in your elementary science class that Sir Isaac Newton discovered gravity. It would be more accurate to say that he labeled rather than discovered it. His use of the word gravity gave us a cognitive category; we now converse about the pull of the earth’s forces that keeps us from flying into space. Words give us the symbolic vehicles to communicate our creations and discoveries to others.",
		"Both mammals and birds are noisy creatures. They commonly make their presence felt, and communicate, by sound, but birds are far better at it. Many mammals produce different sounds for different objects, but few can match the range of meaningful sounds that birds may give voice to. Apart from human beings, mammals on the whole are not melodious and there is little evidence that they intend to be. Some mammals bellow, but few sing, apart from human beings and perhaps whales. Yet many birds are famed for their songs and some of the most glorious songsters are the ones we encounter most often.",
		"There is growing evidence that dependence on automobile travel contributes to insufficient physical activity, transport­related carbon dioxide emissions, and traffic congestion. The city of Freiburg in Germany has been successful in applying sustainable transport policies that may influence car­oriented countries around the world. Over the last three decades, transport policies in Freiburg have encouraged more walking, cycling, and use of public transport. During this period, the number of bicycle trips has tripled, travel by public transport has doubled, and the proportion of journeys by automobile has declined from 38% to 32%. Since 1990, motorization rates have stayed the same and carbon dioxide emissions from transport have fallen, despite strong economic growth.",
		"Tourism is one of many contributors to changes in the climate system. As with other human activities, there are many ways and spatial scales at which tourism contributes to climate change. For example, changes in land cover and use, such as replacing forest with resort buildings and other structures, can modify the local climate. Local climate changes may also be caused when air pollutants are emitted by the structures’ incinerators, by stationary and mobile engines, and during land­clearing activities. Gradually, over space and time, even these locally focused human activities are known to change the climate, regionally and globally. They work together with more global scale forces such as those related to emissions from aircraft carrying tourists to and from their destinations.",
		"The truth that has been merely learned sticks to us like an artificial limb, a false tooth, or a nose of wax. On the other hand, the truth acquired through our own thinking is like the natural limb; it alone really belongs to us. On this rests the distinction between the thinker and the mere scholar. The intellectual gain of the thinker who thinks for himself is, therefore, like a beautiful painting that vividly stands out with perfect harmony of colors. The intellectual acquisition of the mere scholar, on the other hand, is like a large palette full of bright colors but without harmony.",
		"Companies would like to enhance employee contentment on the job for several reasons. Job satisfaction increases productivity because happy employees work harder, allowing them to produce more at a lower cost. Moreover, in many service organizations, client satisfaction often depends directly on the attitudes of employees, who are the company’s face for customers. Because people’s purchasing patterns are affected by how they feel during the buying experience, happy employees matter. When workers are dissatisfied, their unhappiness makes the customer’s experience worse; as a result, consumers buy less, and company performance suffers. Clearly, it is important for companies to know what makes their employees satisfied with their jobs.",
		"Food shortages caused by global warming could force as many as 1 billion people to leave their homes by 2050, according to the Earth Institute, a New York­based aid agency. Hardest hit may be Africa, which could lose two­thirds of its cropland due to desertification, which occurs when the land loses its ability to produce vegetation and turns into deserts. Although many scientists expect climate change to result in more rainfall, some areas could experience droughts because rainfall is sporadic or falls in concentrations in some places but misses others. Also, desertification could occur because warmer temperatures draw moisture out of the soil. When regions can no longer produce food, people will be forced to move to other areas, making them “climate refugees.”",
		"The use of drones in science has been increasing. Drones may be useful to collect all kinds of research data. For instance, in meteorology drones can collect data on humidity, pressure, temperature, wind force, radiation, etc. In case of nearing tornados or hurricanes, people c a n seek safety with the help of the data gathered by drones. Drones can gather relevant data in places that were previously difficult or costly to reach―data that may provide new scientific knowledge about the atmosphere and the climate. Such knowledge may improve existing climate models and provide more accurate predictions.",
		"In addition to controlling temperatures when handling fresh produce, control of the atmosphere is important. Some moisture is needed in the air to prevent dehydration during storage, but too much moisture can encourage growth of molds. Some commercial storage units have controlled atmospheres, with the levels of both carbon dioxide and moisture being regulated carefully. Sometimes other gases, such as ethylene gas, may be introduced at controlled levels to help achieve optimal quality of bananas and other fresh produce. Related to the control of gases and moisture is the need for some circulation of air among the stored foods.",
		"The body has an effective system of natural defence against parasites, called the immune system. The immune system is so complicated that it would take a whole book to explain it. Briefly, when it senses a dangerous parasite, the body is mobilized to produce special cells, which are carried by the blood into battle like a kind of army. Usually the immune system wins, and the person recovers. After that, the immune system remembers the molecular equipment that it developed for that particular battle, and any following infection by the same kind of parasite is beaten off so quickly that we don’t notice it. That is why, once you have had a disease like the measles or chicken pox, you’re unlikely to get it again.",
		"At their heart, games differ from other media in one fundamental way: they offer players the chance to influence outcomes through their own efforts. With rare exception, this is not true of film, novels, or television. Readers and viewers of these other media follow along, reacting to the story and its twists and turns, without having a direct personal impact on the events they witness. In games, players have the unique ability to control what unfolds. As Sid Meier, a game designer, once said, “A good game is a series of interesting choices.”",
		"Hygge, a term that comes from Danish, is both a noun and a verb and does not have a direct translation into English. The closest word would have to be coziness, but that doesn’t really do it justice. While hygge is centered around cozy activities, it also includes a mental state of well-being and togetherness. It’s a holistic approach to deliberately creating intimacy, connection, and warmth with ourselves and those around us. When we hygge, we make a conscious decision to find joy in the simple things. For example, lighting candles and drinking wine with a close friend you haven’t seen in a while, or sprawling out on a blanket while having a relaxing picnic in the park with a circle of your loved ones in the summertime can both be hygge.",
		"When we were infants, we were tuned in to the signals from our body that told us when to eat and when to stop. We had an instinctive awareness of what foods and how much food our body needed. As we grew older this inner wisdom became lost in a bewildering host of outer voices that told us how we should eat. We received conflicting messages from our parents, from our peers, and from scientific research. These messages created a confusion of desires, impulses, and aversions that have made us unable to just eat and to eat just enough. If we are to return to a healthy and balanced relationship with food, it is essential that we learn to turn our awareness inward and to hear again what our body is always telling us.",
		"People often assume erroneously that if a Hadza adult of Tanzania does not know how to solve an algebraic equation, then he must be less intelligent than we are. Yet there is no evidence to suggest that people from some cultures are fast learners and people from others are slow learners. The study of comparative cultures has taught us that people in different cultures learn different cultural content (attitudes, values, ideas, and behavioral patterns) and that they accomplish this with similar efficiency. The traditional Hadza hunter has not learned algebra because such knowledge would not particularly enhance his adaptation to life in the East African grasslands. However, he would know how to track a wounded bush buck that he has not seen for three days and where to find groundwater.",
		"The first commercial train service began operating between Liverpool and Manchester in 1830. Ten years later, the first train timetable was issued. The trains were much faster than the old carriages, so the peculiar differences in local hours became a severe nuisance. In 1847, British train companies put their heads together and agreed that henceforth all train timetables would be adjusted to Greenwich Observatory time, rather than the local times of Liverpool, Manchester, or Glasgow. More and more institutions followed the lead of the train companies. Finally, in 1880, the British government took the unprecedented step of legislating that all timetables in Britain must follow Greenwich. For the first time in history, a country adopted a national time and obliged its population to live according to an artificial clock rather than local ones or sunrise­to­sunset cycles.",
		"Cultural globalization has multiple centers in Asia like Bollywood movies made in India and Kung Fu movies made in Hong Kong. They are subtitled in as many as 17 languages and distributed to specific diasporas. These cultural spaces, which are dominated by languages like Hindi and Mandarin, ignore and challenge the spread of English. Professor Vaish has shown how Chinese and Indian children in Singapore are networked into the pan-Chinese and pan-Indian culture through their engagement with Chinese pop music and Indian movies respectively. She thus empirically challenges the idea that Asian youth are passive victims of cultural globalization, or “world culture” that comes out of the West.",
		"There are many superstitions surrounding the world of the theater. Superstitions can be anything from not wanting to say the last line of a play before the first audience comes, to not wanting to rehearse the curtain call before the final rehearsal. Shakespeare’s famous tragedy Macbeth is said to be cursed, and to avoid problems actors never say the title of the play out loud when inside a theater or a theatrical space (like a rehearsal room or costume shop). Since the play is set in Scotland, the secret code you say when you need to say the title of the play is “the Scottish play.” If you do say the title by accident, legend has it that you have to go outside, turn around three times, and come back into the theater.",
		"Marketing management is concerned not only with finding and increasing demand but also with changing or even reducing it. For example, Uluru (Ayers Rock) might have too many tourists wanting to climb it, and Daintree National Park in North Queensland can become overcrowded in the tourist season. Power companies sometimes have trouble meeting demand during peak usage periods. In these and other cases of excess demand, the needed marketing task, called demarketing, is to reduce demand temporarily or permanently. The aim of demarketing is not to completely destroy demand, but only to reduce or shift it to another time, or even another product. Thus, marketing management seeks to affect the level, timing, and nature of demand in a way that helps the organisation achieve its objectives.",
		"The major oceans are all interconnected, so that their geographical boundaries are less clear than those of the continents. As a result, their biotas show fewer clear differences than those on land. The oceans themselves are continually moving because the water within each ocean basin slowly rotates. These moving waters carry marine organisms from place to place, and also help the dispersal of their young or larvae. Furthermore, the gradients between the environments of different areas of ocean water mass are very gradual and often extend over wide areas that are inhabited by a great variety of organisms of differing ecological tolerances. There are no firm boundaries within the open oceans although there may be barriers to the movement of organisms.",
		"Academics, politicians, marketers and others have in the past debated whether or not it is ethically correct to market products and services directly to young consumers. This is also a dilemma for psychologists who have questioned whether they ought to help advertisers manipulate children into purchasing more products they have seen advertised. Advertisers have admitted to taking advantage of the fact that it is easy to make children feel that they are losers if they do not own the ‘right’ products. Clever advertising informs children that they will be viewed by their peers in an unfavorable way if they do not have the products that are advertised, thereby playing on their emotional vulnerabilities. The constant feelings of inadequateness created by advertising have been suggested to contribute to children becoming fixated with instant gratification and beliefs that material possessions are important.",
		"An interesting phenomenon that arose from social media is the concept of social proof. It’s easier for a person to accept new values or ideas when they see that others have already done so. If the person they see accepting the new idea happens to be a friend, then social proof has even more power by exerting peer pressure as well as relying on the trust that people put in the judgments of their close friends. For example, a video about some issue may be controversial on its own but more credible if it got thousands of likes. If a friend recommends the video to you, in many cases, the credibility of the idea it presents will rise in direct proportion to the trust you place in the friend recommending the video. This is the power of social media and part of the reason why videos or “posts” can become “viral.”",
		"Nurses hold a pivotal position in the mental health care structure and are placed at the centre of the communication network, partly because of their high degree of contact with patients, but also because they have well­developed relationships with other professionals. Because of this, nurses play a crucial role in interdisciplinary communication. They have a mediating role between the various groups of professionals and the patient and carer. This involves translating communication between groups into language that is acceptable and comprehensible to people who have different ways of understanding mental health problems. This is a highly sensitive and skilled task, requiring a high level of attention to alternative views and a high level of understanding of communication.",
		"There is a pervasive idea in Western culture that humans are essentially rational, skillfully sorting fact from fiction, and, ultimately, arriving at timeless truths about the world. This line of thinking holds that humans follow the rules of logic, calculate probabilities accurately, and make decisions about the world that are perfectly informed by all available information. Conversely, failures to make effective and well-informed decisions are often attributed to failures of human reasoning— resulting, say, from psychological disorders or cognitive biases. In this picture, whether we succeed or fail turns out to be a matter of whether individual humans are rational and intelligent. And so, if we want to achieve better outcomes—truer beliefs, better decisions—we need to focus on improving individual human reasoning.",
		"Today’s “digital natives” have grown up immersed in digital technologies and possess the technical aptitude to utilize the powers of their devices fully. But although they know which apps to use or which websites to visit, they do not necessarily understand the workings behind the touch screen. People need technological literacy if they are to understand machines’ mechanics and uses. In much the same way as factory workers a hundred years ago needed to understand the basic structures of engines, we need to understand the elemental principles behind our devices. This empowers us to deploy software and hardware to their fullest utility, maximizing our powers to achieve and create.",
		"Inflationary risk refers to uncertainty regarding the future real value of one’s investments. Say, for instance, that you hold $100 in a bank account that has no fees and accrues no interest. If left untouched there will always be $100 in that bank account. If you keep that money in the bank for a year, during which inflation is 100 percent, you’ve still got $100. Only now, if you take it out and put it in your wallet, you’ll only be able to purchase half the goods you could have bought a year ago. In other words, if inflation increases faster than the amount of interest you are earning, this will decrease the purchasing power of your investments over time. That’s why we differentiate between nominal value and real value.",
		"Taking a stand is important because you become a beacon for those individuals who are your people, your tribe, and your audience. When you raise your viewpoint up like a flag, people know where to find you; it becomes a rallying point. Displaying your perspective lets prospective (and current) customers know that you don’t just sell your products or services. The best marketing is never just about selling a product or service, but about taking a stand— showing an audience why they should believe in what you’re marketing enough to want it at any cost, simply because they agree with what you’re doing. Products can be changed or adjusted if they aren’t functioning, but rallying points align with the values and meaning behind what you do.",
		"Of all the human emotions, none is trickier or more elusive than envy. It is very difficult to actually discern the envy that motivates people’s actions. The reason for this elusiveness is simple: we almost never directly express the envy we are feeling. Envy entails the admission to ourselves that we are inferior to another person in something we value. Not only is it painful to admit this inferiority, but it is even worse for others to see that we are feeling this. And so almost as soon as we experience the initial feelings of envy, we are motivated to disguise it to ourselves—it is not envy we feel but unfairness at the distribution of goods or attention, resentment at this unfairness, even anger.",
		"Human processes differ from rational processes in their outcome. A process is rational if it always does the right thing based on the current information, given an ideal performance measure. In short, rational processes go by the book and assume that the book is actually correct. Human processes involve instinct, intuition, and other variables that don’t necessarily reflect the book and may not even consider the existing data. As an example, the rational way to drive a car is to always follow the laws. However, traffic isn’t rational; if you follow the laws precisely, you end up stuck somewhere because other drivers aren’t following the laws precisely. To be successful, a self‑driving car must therefore act humanly, rather than rationally.",
		"Before getting licensed to drive a cab in London, a person has to pass an incredibly difficult test with an intimidating name—“The Knowledge.” The test involves memorizing the layout of more than 20,000 streets in the Greater London area—a feat that involves an incredible amount of memory resources. In fact, fewer than 50 percent of the people who sign up for taxi driver training pass the test, even after spending two or three years studying for it! And as it turns out, the brains of London cabbies are different from non­cab­driving humans in ways that reflect their herculean memory efforts. In fact, the part of the brain that has been most frequently associated with spatial memory, the tail of the sea horse­shaped brain region called the hippocampus, is bigger than average in these taxi drivers.",
		"The irony of early democracy in Europe is that it thrived and prospered precisely because European rulers for a very long time were remarkably weak. For more than a millennium after the fall of Rome, European rulers lacked the ability to assess what their people were producing and to levy substantial taxes based on this. The most striking way to illustrate European weakness is to show how little revenue they collected. Europeans would eventually develop strong systems of revenue collection, but it took them an awfully long time to do so. In medieval times, and for part of the early modern era, Chinese emperors and Muslim caliphs were able to extract much more of economic production than any European ruler with the exception of small city­states.",
		"Moral excellence, according to Aristotle, is the result of habit and repetition, though modern science would also suggest that it may have an innate, genetic component. This means that moral excellence will be broadly set early in our lives, which is why the question of how early to teach it is so important. Freud suggested that we don’t change our personality much after age five or thereabouts, but as in many other things, Freud was wrong. Recent psychological research shows that personality traits stabilize around age thirty in both men and women and regardless of ethnicity as the human brain continues to develop, both neuroanatomically and in terms of cognitive skills, until the mid-twenties. The advantage of this new understanding is that we can be a bit more optimistic than Aristotle and Freud about being able to teach moral excellence.",
		"A currently popular attitude is to blame technology or technologists for having brought on the environmental problems we face today, and thus to try to slow technological advance by blocking economic growth. We believe this view to be thoroughly misguided. If technology produced automobiles that pollute the air, it is because pollution was not recognized as a problem which engineers had to consider in their designs. Obviously, technology that produces pollution is generally cheaper, but now that it has been decided that cleaner cars are wanted, less polluting cars will be produced; cars which scarcely pollute at all could even be made. This last option, however, would require several years and much investment. Although technology is responsive to the will of the people, it can seldom respond instantaneously and is never free.",
		"Food intake is essential for the survival of every living organism. The failure to detect spoiled or toxic food can have deadly consequences. Therefore, it is not surprising that humans use all their five senses to analyze food quality. A first judgment about the value of a food source is made on its appearance and smell. Food that looks and smells attractive is taken into the mouth. Here, based on a complex sensory analysis that is not only restricted to the sense of taste but also includes smell, touch, and hearing, the final decision whether to swallow or reject food is made. Frequently, this complex interaction between different senses is inappropriately referred to as ‘taste’ although it should be better called flavor perception, because it uses multiple senses.",
		"Most often, you will find or meet people who introduce themselves in terms of their work or by what they spend time on. These people introduce themselves as a salesman or an executive. There is nothing criminal in doing this, but psychologically, we become what we believe. People who follow this practice tend to lose their individuality and begin to live with the notion that they are recognized by the job they do. However, jobs may not be permanent, and you may lose your job for countless reasons, some of which you may not even be responsible for. In such a case, these people suffer from an inevitable social and mental trauma, leading to emotional stress and a feeling that all of a sudden they have been disassociated from what once was their identity.",
		"In the context of SNS, media literacy has been argued to be especially important “in order to make the users aware of their rights when using SNS tools, and also help them acquire or reinforce human rights values and develop the behaviour necessary to respect other people’s rights and freedoms”. With regard to peer-to-peer risks such as bullying, this last element is of particular importance. This relates to a basic principle that children are taught in the offline world as well: ‘do not do to others what you would not want others to do to you’. This should also be a golden rule with regard to SNS, but for children and young people it is much more difficult to estimate the consequences and potential serious impact of their actions in this environment. Hence, raising awareness of children from a very early age about the particular characteristics of SNS and the potential long-term impact of a seemingly trivial act is crucial.",
		"When photography came along in the nineteenth century, painting was put in crisis. The photograph, it seemed, did the work of imitating nature better than the painter ever could. Some painters made practical use of the invention. There were Impressionist painters who used a photograph in place of the model or landscape they were painting. But by and large, the photograph was a challenge to painting and was one cause of painting’s moving away from direct representation and reproduction to the abstract painting of the twentieth century. Since photographs did such a good job of representing things as they existed in the world, painters were freed to look inward and represent things as they were in their imagination, rendering emotion in the color, volume, line, and spatial configurations native to the painter’s art.",
		"Although commonsense knowledge may have merit, it also has weaknesses, not the least of which is that it often contradicts itself. For example, we hear that people who are similar will like one another (“Birds of a feather flock together”) but also that persons who are dissimilar will like each other (“Opposites attract”). We are told that groups are wiser and smarter than individuals (“Two heads are better than one”) but also that group work inevitably produces poor results (“Too many cooks spoil the broth”). Each of these contradictory statements may hold true under particular conditions, but without a clear statement of when they apply and when they do not, aphorisms provide little insight into relations among people. They provide even less guidance in situations where we must make decisions. For example, when facing a choice that entails risk, which guideline should we use―“Nothing ventured, nothing gained” or “Better safe than sorry”?",
		"Workers are united by laughing at shared events, even ones that may initially spark anger or conflict. Humor reframes potentially divisive events into merely “laughable” ones which are put in perspective as subservient to unifying values held by organization members. Repeatedly recounting humorous incidents reinforces unity based on key organizational values. One team told repeated stories about a dumpster fire, something that does not seem funny on its face, but the reactions of workers motivated to preserve safety sparked laughter as the stories were shared multiple times by multiple parties in the workplace. Shared events that cause laughter can indicate a sense of belonging since “you had to be there” to see the humor in them, and non-members were not and do not. Instances of humor serve to enact bonds among organization members. Understanding the humor may even be required as an informal badge of membership in the organization.",
		"Since their introduction, information systems have substantially changed the way business is conducted. This is particularly true for business in the shape and form of cooperation between firms that involves an integration of value chains across multiple units. The resulting networks do not only cover the business units of a single firm but typically also include multiple units from different firms. As a consequence, firms do not only need to consider their internal organization in order to ensure sustainable business performance; they also need to take into account the entire ecosystem of units surrounding them. In order to allow these different units to cooperate successfully, the existence of a common platform is crucial.",
		"Actors, singers, politicians and countless others recognise the power of the human voice as a means of communication beyond the simple decoding of the words that are used. Learning to control your voice and use it for different purposes is, therefore, one of the most important skills to develop as an early career teacher. The more confidently you give instructions, the higher the chance of a positive class response. There are times when being able to project your voice loudly will be very useful when working in school, and knowing that you can cut through a noisy classroom, dinner hall or playground is a great skill to have. However, I would always advise that you use your loudest voice incredibly sparingly and avoid shouting as much as possible. A quiet, authoritative and measured tone has so much more impact than slightly panicked shouting.",
		"Speaking fast is a high-risk proposition. It’s nearly impossible to maintain the ideal conditions to be persuasive, well-spoken, and effective when the mouth is traveling well over the speed limit. Although we’d like to think that our minds are sharp enough to always make good decisions with the greatest efficiency, they just aren’t. In reality, the brain arrives at an intersection of four or five possible things to say and sits idling for a couple of seconds, considering the options. When the brain stops sending navigational instructions back to the mouth and the mouth is moving too fast to pause, that’s when you get a verbal fender bender, otherwise known as filler. Um, ah, you know, and like are what your mouth does when it has nowhere to go.",
		"Fascinated by how easily fish slip through water, scientists and sportswear designers alike have examined fish skins at the molecular level to determine why they have less friction than humans. Researchers were surprised to discover that shark skin, which is rough enough to be used as sandpaper when dried, is one of the animal skins with the least friction. Shark skin is covered by small, V-shaped bumps, made from the same material as the sharks’ teeth. The rough surface actually reduces drag as the shark glides through the ocean, because the bumps efficiently channel the water away from the surface. Copied in fabric form, a shark skin-like system woven into a textile’s structure gives the fabric a hydrodynamic advantage.",
		"Like any other organ or system in the body, bone becomes stronger when it is stressed regularly, and it becomes weak when it is not used enough. In this case, “stressed” means loaded through impact and tension, as occurs during running. For the best explanation of bones becoming weak, take a look at astronauts. Their bones are unloaded and not used much during lengthy stays in the zero-gravity environment of space. When they arrive back on Earth, their bones are often so weak that they can barely support the astronaut’s body weight.",
		"Music can convey the scope of a film, effectively communicating whether the motion picture is an epic drama or a story that exists on a more personal scale. Music can convey the quality and size of a space. For example, in Alien and Olivier’s Hamlet, the music serves at times to make small and/or artificial spaces seem more grand and to enhance the sense of realism. In addition, music can establish a narrative’s placement in time. Music for motion pictures often serves to authenticate the era or to provide a sense of nostalgia. Examples of the former would include Amadeus and Immortal Beloved, while a sense of nostalgia is communicated through the music selected for films such as American Graffiti and The Big Chill.",
		"It is difficult to appreciate what a temperature of 20,000,000℃ means. If the solar surface, not the center, were as hot as this, the radiation emitted into space would be so great that the whole Earth would be vaporized within a few minutes. Indeed, this is just what would happen if some cosmic giant were to peel off the outer layers of the Sun like skinning an orange, for the tremendously hot inner regions would then be exposed. Fortunately, no such circumstance is possible, and the outer layers of the Sun provide a sort of blanket that protects us from its inner fires. Yet in spite of these blanketing layers, some energy must leak through from the Sun’s center to its outer regions, and this leakage is of just the right amount to compensate for the radiation emitted by the surface into surrounding space.",
		"Despite the conventional wisdom of some management trainers that group brainstorming is an effective way of generating ideas, more objective research has recently suggested otherwise. People working in groups often produce ideas that are fewer in number and lower in quality than the same individuals working for a period alone. When people engaging in group problem­solving share their thoughts and information too quickly, none of them has a chance to develop an independent viewpoint before it is subject to influence by the thoughts and experiences of others. Under such conditions, it has been shown that people tend to converge too rapidly on a solution, or at least on an agreed way of conceptualizing the problem, that may be less than optimal. When you insert periods of more solitary thinking between the discussions, you tend to get higher­quality ideas and solutions.",
		"Some researchers investigated the effects of different media on children’s ability to produce imaginative responses. In one study, children in grades one through four were separated randomly into two groups and presented with the same fictional story. One group listened to the story via radio, while the other group watched the story on a television. Afterward, all of the children were asked what they thought would happen next in the story. The researchers rated children’s imaginativeness by recording the novel elements (such as characters, setting, dialogue, and feelings) they used in their responses. The children who listened to the radio produced more imaginative responses, whereas the children who watched the television produced more words that repeated the original story. Media scholars have used this study to illustrate the “visualization hypothesis,” which states that children’s exposure to ready-made visual images restricts their ability to generate novel images of their own.",
		"One of the many strengths of the African American community is an intrinsic support for the athletic endeavors of African American girls and women. Since African American culture appreciates a greater flexibility of gender roles and accepts a broader range of gender-appropriate behaviors, African American women are not as bound as white women by gender role stereotypes. Athletics for girls and women is not perceived as conflicting with an African American female’s gender role. Hall and Bower’s study of African American females found that African American women defined themselves as “softly strong”―owning both strength and femininity without conflict. Welcome support from the African American community has energized many African American girls and women to participate in sports.",
		"As striking as the Greeks’ freedom and individuality is their sense of curiosity about the world. Aristotle thought that curiosity was the uniquely defining property of human beings. St. Luke said of the Athenians of a later era: “They spend their time in nothing else but to tell or to hear some new thing.” The Greeks, far more than their contemporaries, speculated about the nature of the world they found themselves in and created models of it. They constructed these models by categorizing objects and events and generating rules about them that were sufficiently precise for systematic description and explanation. This characterized their advances in the fields of physics, astronomy, geometry, rational philosophy, and natural history.",
		"The tongue map was based on German research published in 1901, but Edwin Boring, an influential Harvard psychologist, mistranslated it. What the original research had shown was that the human tongue has areas of relative sensitivity to different tastes, but his translation stated that each could only be tasted in one zone. What is really mysterious about the tongue map is that it was the official truth for such a long time, even though it’s so easily disproved. It wasn’t until 1974 that another American scientist, Dr. Virginia Collings, reexamined the original theory. She showed that, though sensitivity to the four main tastes did vary around the tongue, it was only to an insignificant degree.",
		"Animals may have a limited understanding of what is happening now, but only humans seem to enrich their understanding of the present by thoughtful links to events in the distant past and future. Indeed, human goals often link what one does now to possible outcomes that lie years away. Thus, human action is not just a here­and­now response but is often designed to help bring about something far off, such as graduation or marriage or retirement. It can also be linked to things that have happened elsewhere or long ago, such as when people celebrate Independence Day or a religious holiday. Moreover, people often follow the rules made in distant places by people they will never meet. Most Americans pay income tax, for example, though few have any direct contact with the people who make the tax laws.",
		"Enough sunlight falls on Earth to meet our energy needs ten thousand times over. However, it’s highly dispersed. Various technologies already exist to concentrate the sunlight using curved mirrors and focus it on tanks of liquid―usually water or oil. If you’re lucky enough to live in a sunny part of the country, solar heating panels like these are an excellent way to heat water for individual homes. They sit on the roof rather like a satellite dish and provide baths and showers that are satisfyingly hot and guilt-free. Solar heating can also be used on a much larger scale, by making the hot liquid drive an engine to generate electricity.",
		"Food is neither good nor bad in the absolute, though we have been taught to recognize it as such. The organ of taste is not the tongue, but the brain, a culturally (and therefore historically) determined organ through which the criteria for evaluations are transmitted and learned. Therefore, these criteria vary in space and in time. What in one era is judged positively, in another can change meaning; what in one locale is considered tasty, in another can be rejected as disgusting. Definitions of taste belong to the cultural heritage of human society. As there are differing tastes and preferences among different peoples and regions of the world, so do tastes and preferences evolve over the course of centuries.",
		"School physical education programs should offer a balanced variety of activities that allow young people to develop ability in lifetime activities that are personally meaningful and enjoyable. A balance should exist in any physical education program among team, dual, and individual (lifetime) sports. Team sports such as basketball and soccer provide an opportunity for students to develop skills and to enjoy working and competing together as a team. However, in many school physical education programs, team sports dominate the curriculum at the expense of various individual and dual sports, like tennis, swimming, badminton, and golf. In such cases, the students lose the opportunity to develop skills in activities that they can participate in throughout their adult lives. Only through a balanced program of team, dual, and individual sports is it possible to develop well-rounded individuals.",
		"Despite all the increasingly user‒friendly and popular technology, most studies published since the early 1990s confirm earlier conclusions: paper still has advantages over screens as a reading medium. Together, laboratory experiments, polls, and consumer reports indicate that digital devices prevent people from efficiently navigating long texts, which may subtly inhibit reading comprehension. Compared with paper, screens may also drain more of our mental resources while we are reading and make it a little harder to remember what we read when we are done. Whether they realize it or not, people often approach computers and tablets with a state of mind less beneficial to learning than the one they bring to paper. E‒readers also fail to recreate certain tactile experiences of reading on paper, the absence of which some find unsettling.",
		"Scientific experiments should be designed to show that your hypothesis is wrong and should be conducted completely objectively with no possible subjective influence on the outcome. Unfortunately few, if any, scientists are truly objective as they have often decided long before the experiment is begun what they would like the result to be. This means that very often bias is (unintentionally) introduced into the experiment, the experimental procedure or the interpretation of results. It is all too easy to justify to yourself why an experiment which does not fit with your expectations should be ignored, and why one which provides the results you ‘hoped for’ is the right one. This can be partly avoided by conducting experiments ‘blinded’ and by asking others to check your data or repeat experiments.",
		"Parents are commonly reluctant to grant their grown children equal footing with them as adults. This delay can persist into later life, especially if geographic distance prevents parents from witnessing their children’s success in jobs or relationships. More decisively than most life experiences, illness can cause a change in such a relationship by forcing parents to accept help from their children. A father who decides to rely on his son to do his banking, for example, implicitly affirms his son’s capabilities as an adult. Such reliance conveys a trust that may be deeply satisfying to the son. By allowing his son to be a provider of help, the father actually gives emotionally more than he receives practically.",
		"By some estimates, music based on oral tradition had previously seldom been performed for more than one or two generations. By contrast, with the coming of records not only were the “classics” preserved, but formerly ephemeral “hits” could now survive as “oldies.” So the music of one generation’s youth could be replayed years later to evoke memories in some (often quite narrow) age group of people. Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms of course survived well beyond their social and cultural settings, taking on new meanings in the recordable world. Memories of falling in love or just being free and having fun also came to be linked to tunes that could be recalled or replayed again and again throughout life, thanks to the recording.",
		"Not until the rise of ecology at the beginning of the twentieth century did people begin to think seriously of land as a natural system with interconnecting parts. A century earlier, Thomas Jefferson had vigorously promoted an orderly division of the American land, beginning with the Northwest Territory. Surveyors were sent forth to draw rectangular grids on the land, dividing the wilds into counties, townships, and ultimately homesteads, with little concern for terrain or other natural features. That system had its virtues, but in time ecology made the lines appear artificial. As some observers would come to see it, the rectangular grid system caused as much harm as it did good.",
		"Roles are like a fence. They allow us a certain amount of freedom, but for most of us that freedom doesn’t go very far. Suppose that a woman decides that she is not going to wear dresses—or a man that he will not wear suits and ties— regardless of what anyone says. In most situations, they’ll stick to their decision. When a formal occasion comes along, however, such as a family wedding or a funeral, they are likely to cave in to norms that they find overwhelming. Almost all of us follow the guidelines for what is “appropriate” for our roles. Few of us are bothered by such restrictions, for our socialization is so thorough that we usually want to do what our roles indicate is appropriate.",
		"Once you have made a decision, you have to be able to live with it. Sometimes we make bad decisions that are irreversible. If you make a commitment in a negotiation, you have to uphold it, even if you know it was a bad decision on your part. You can always go back and ask to renegotiate a deal or issue, but you have to maintain your commitment if renegotiation is not possible or is unsuccessful. If you break a commitment made in a negotiation, you can be sure that you will not get the opportunity to negotiate with that particular party again. Sometimes it is painful to fulfill a commitment, but it is more painful and can be fatal to lose business because you failed to fulfill a commitment.",
		"The pull effect of a destination can be positively influenced by the introduction and reinforcement of pro-tourism policies that make a destination more accessible. Governments, for example, can and often do employ awareness campaigns among the resident population to promote a welcoming attitude towards visitors, in order to foster a positive market image. However, because such campaigns depend on widespread social engineering, and because their effects can be counteracted by random acts of violence, positive outcomes cannot be guaranteed. Furthermore, it is the behaviour of some tourists, and the structure and development of tourism itself, that often generate negative attitudes within the host community. This implies that major structural changes to tourism itself, rather than awareness campaigns, may be required to foster a welcoming attitude.",
		"Certain personality characteristics make some people more resistant to distress. Individuals who believe they control their own destinies and generally expect the best from life are, in fact, more likely to gain control of their stressors and experience positive stress rather than distress, according to research. It is important to realize that these person factors—self­mastery and optimism—are not permanent inborn traits of people. They are states of mind or expectations derived from personal experience, and they can be nurtured. It is possible to give people experiences that increase feelings of being “in control”—experiences that lead people to believe something good will come from their attempts to turn stress into constructive action.",
		"Parents play a huge role in every aspect of their children’s life, even in the athletic aspect. It is a good thing for parents to encourage and support their children in sports which interest them, and this involves forming a good relationship with the children’s coach. Parents and coaches then should help hand in hand to foster a positive athletic atmosphere for players. Coaches then should exert extra effort in getting to know the parents of their players, and by so doing, determine ways by which parents are willing to help their children and the team in general. When parents and coaches have a dialogue, they also learn more about each other’s expectations and this leads to a better relationship between them as well.",
		"The growing seasons for tea in different geographic areas vary greatly. In a few locations with prime conditions, particularly at latitudes near the equator, tea can be harvested year-round. At higher elevations in areas farther from the equator, the productive season may be limited to only one or two flushes of new growth. For example, Kenya, which lies on the equator, is one of the countries with the potential of year-round harvests, while farmers in areas of Shandong Province, the most northern tea farms in China, begin harvest in April and end in September. Throughout the more than forty countries that grow tea commercially, there is a wide range in conditions that lead to the great variations of harvest times and in the flavors of the teas they produce.",
		"Since the concept of a teddy bear is very obviously not a genetically inherited trait, we can be confident that we are looking at a cultural trait. However, it is a cultural trait that seems to be under the guidance of another, genuinely biological trait: the cues that attract us to babies (high foreheads and small faces). Cute, baby-like features are inherently appealing, producing a nurturing response in most humans. Teddy bears that had a more baby-like appearance ―however slight this may have been initially―were thus more popular with customers. Teddy bear manufacturers obviously noticed which bears were selling best and so made more of these and fewer of the less popular models, to maximize their profits. In this way, the selection pressure built up by the customers resulted in the evolution of a more baby-like bear by the manufacturers.",
		"Robots are mechanical creatures that we make in the laboratory, so whether we have killer robots or friendly robots depends on the direction of AI research. In the West, much of the funding comes from the military, which is specifically given authority to win wars, so killer robots are a definite possibility. However, since 30 percent of all commercial robots are manufactured in Japan, there is another possibility: robots will be designed to become helpful playmates and workers from the very beginning. This goal is within reach if the consumer sector dominates robotics research. The philosophy of “friendly AI” is that inventors should create robots that, from the very first steps, are programmed to be beneficial to humans.",
		"One of the hallmarks of evaluating the quality of a black tea is by assessing how tightly the leaves are rolled. Generally, higher-graded teas are teas with leaves that are tightly and uniformly rolled. Lower-graded teas, on the other hand, are teas with leaves that are loosely and inconsistently rolled. With that said, the tightness of the roll has more to do with the steepability of a leaf than it does with the taste of a tea. Therefore, one should not evaluate the tea’s drinkability or taste merely because its leaves are not tightly rolled. It is common to find that people prefer the taste of looser rolled black teas over more expensive or more highly graded black teas that have been tightly rolled.",
		"Large satellites for collecting solar power and transmitting it to the Earth have been the subject of much study. Their potential is vast indeed. The energy from the Sun that reaches the Earth over the course of just three days is equal to the energy in the fossil fuels needed to keep the human race supplied with power for 100 years at the present rate of consumption. A satellite of just 155 miles (250 km) in diameter could supply all of our present energy needs, assuming 10% overall efficiency, with a very low carbon footprint. Solar panels in orbit are always in sunlight, they can always point directly at the Sun, and the radiation from the Sun is not reduced by atmospheric absorption. As a result, the energy intake for cells in orbit is on average about ten times greater than that of terrestrial ones.",
		"Reading is a technology for perspective­taking. When someone else’s thoughts are in your head, you are observing the world from that person’s vantage point. Not only are you taking in sights and sounds that you could not experience firsthand, but you have stepped inside that person’s mind and are temporarily sharing his or her attitudes and reactions. Empathy in the sense of adopting someone’s viewpoint is not the same as empathy in the sense of feeling compassion toward the person, but the first can lead to the second by a natural route. Stepping into someone else’s vantage point reminds you that the other fellow has a first­person, present­tense, ongoing stream of consciousness that is very much like your own but not the same as your own. It’s not a big leap to suppose that the habit of reading other people’s words could put one in the habit of entering other people’s minds, including their pleasures and pains.",
		"There is a widely accepted theory in social psychology known as the pratfall effect, which actually states that making certain kinds of mistakes makes you more likable because you are relatable in your vulnerability. This phenomenon has been tested and confirmed many times over, and remembering it can help you to feel better in times of embarrassment or shame. One simple example of the pratfall effect’s validity is that people tend to like a person who clumsily trips on video more than one who doesn’t trip in the video. When we feel embarrassed, it’s natural to assume that others might like us less because we like ourselves a bit less in those moments. But if we don’t take ourselves too seriously in those moments and bear them with a smile, it can even be attractive to others.",
		"While being an introvert comes with its challenges, it definitely has its advantages as well. For example, an introvert is far less likely to make a mistake in a social situation, such as inadvertently insulting another person whose opinion is not agreeable. An introvert would enjoy reflecting on their thoughts, and thus would be far less likely to suffer from boredom without outside stimulation. The only risk that you will face as an introvert is that people who do not know you may think that you are aloof or that you think you are better than them. If you learn how to open up just a little bit with your opinions and thoughts, you will be able to thrive in both worlds. You can then stay true to your personality without appearing to be antisocial.",
		"Bert Vogelstein’s latest effort is what he calls a “liquid biopsy.” A blood sample is taken and tested for the presence of even the tiniest amounts of tumor DNA. A tumor detected by Vogelstein’s liquid biopsy can be detected at just 1 percent the size of what is necessary to be detected by an MRI, currently the most reliable tool for finding cancer. The amount can be so small that the cancer is discovered even before any symptoms have developed. What this effectively means is that getting a blood test for cancer could become part of everybody’s annual medical checkup if the price goes down far enough, as Vogelstein believes it will. The testing done to date by researchers at two dozen medical institutions shows that Vogelstein’s method found 47 percent of earliest­stage cancers.",
		"While the transportation infrastructure may shape where we travel today, in the early eras of travel, it determined whether people could travel at all. The development and improvement of transportation was one of the most important factors in allowing modern tourism to develop on a large scale and become a regular part of the lives of billions of people around the world. Technological advances provided the basis for the explosive expansion of local, regional, and global transportation networks and made travel faster, easier, and cheaper. This not only created new tourist-generating and tourist-receiving regions but also prompted a host of other changes in the tourism infrastructure, such as accommodations. As a result, the availability of transportation infrastructure and services has been considered a fundamental precondition for tourism.",
		"Because dogs dislike bitter tastes, various sprays and gels have been designed to keep them from chewing on furniture or other objects. These compounds often contain bitter substances, which not only have a sharp taste but also cause a burning sensation in the mouth. Coating items with bitter­tasting material will eventually keep most dogs from chewing on them, but the key word is eventually because the taste buds that sense bitterness are located on the rearmost third of the tongue. Therefore, a quick lick or fast gulp will not register the bitter taste. Rather, only prolonged chewing will let the bitterness work its way back to where it can be tasted. Then the dog must also learn to associate the bitter taste with the particular object for the avoidance to be learned.",
		"New technologies encounter challenges based on both how many of our existing habits they promise to alter and the strength of these habits. Lasting behavioral change must occur through existing habits rather than attempts to alter them. People are likely to adopt innovations only if they improve rather than destroy their existing habits, in the same way that electronic calculators made mathematical computations faster. Thus, public policy should encourage behavioral change by targeting the least fixed habits. For example, developing countries could encourage increased protein consumption by offering new high­protein beverages rather than new types of high­protein foods.",
		"Some of the things we profess to value in the abstract may not, in fact, characterize our actual everyday experiences. For instance, we say that “honesty” and “open communication” are the foundational values of any strong relationship. Butthink of how many times you’ve lied to a potential romantic partner in order to make the person feel better about himself or herself. Likewise, every parent knows that lying to their kids about everything from the arrival of Santa Claus to the horrible things that will happen if they don’t eat their peas is a key component of raising a child. As one author put it, “If you want to have love in your life, you’d better be prepared to tell some lies and to believe some lies.”",
		"When a dog is trained to detect drugs, explosives, contraband, or other items, the trainer doesn’t actually teach the dog how to smell; the dog already knows how to discriminate one scent from another. Rather, the dog is trained to become emotionally aroused by one smell versus another. In the step-by-step training process, the trainer attaches an “emotional charge” to a particular scent so that the dog is drawn to it above all others. And then the dog is trained to search out the desired item on cue, so that the trainer can control or release the behavior. This emotional arousal is also why playing tug with a dog is a more powerful emotional reward in a training regime than just giving a dog a food treat, since the trainer invests more emotion into a game of tug. From a dog’s point of view, the tug toy is compelling because the trainer is “upset” by the toy.",
		"Geography greatly restricted colonial communications. Even the simplest postal network requires some sort of transportation system, but such was the difficulty of simply getting from point A to point B, especially overland, that it was easier for residents of Massachusetts and the Carolinas to sail to Great Britain than to visit each other. Whenever possible, colonists and their communiqués floated to their destinations on the boats and rafts that plied the rivers and the winding coast. Otherwise, they traveled by foot or horseback along trails unfit for wheeled vehicles that had been created by game animals and the Indians who hunted them. In a vicious circle, the awful roads interrupted intercolonial communications, which further developed the provinces’ sense of isolation and autonomy, only worsening the chances of unified transportation and postal networks.",
		"Much of what we do each day is automatic and guided by habit, requiring little conscious awareness, and that’s not a bad thing. As Duhigg explains, our habits are necessary mental energy savers. We need to relieve our conscious minds so we can solve new problems as they come up. Once we’ve solved the puzzle of how to ballroom dance, for example, we can do it by habit, and so be mentally freed to focus on a conversation while dancing instead. But try to talk when first learning to dance the tango, and it’s a disaster―we need our conscious attention to focus on the steps. Imagine how little we’d accomplish if we had to focus consciously on every behavior―e.g., on where to place our feet for each step we take.",
		"Competition is basically concerned with how the availability of resources, such as the food and space utilised by various organisms, is reduced by other organisms. Tourism and recreation can result in the transfer of plants and animals to locations where they do not normally occur. In these situations the ‘alien’ species are often at an advantage, because the new environment is usually devoid of any natural controls that the ‘invader’ would have evolved with in its original environment. Alien plants compete with indigenous species for space, light, nutrients and water. The introduction of alien plants can result in the disruption and impoverishment of natural plant communities. This has occurred in South Africa, for example, where introduced Australian shrubs have been and are degrading species­rich fynbos plant communities in the Southern Cape region.",
		"The genre film simplifies film watching as well as filmmaking. In a western, because of the conventions of appearance, dress, and manners, we recognize the hero, sidekick, villain, etc., on sight and assume they will not violate our expectations of their conventional roles. Our familiarity with the genre makes watching not only easier but in some ways more enjoyable. Because we know and are familiar with all the conventions, we gain pleasure from recognizing each character, each image, each familiar situation. The fact that the conventions are established and repeated intensifies another kind of pleasure. Settled into a comfortable genre, with our basic expectations satisfied, we become more keenly aware of and responsive to the creative variations, refinements, and complexities that make the film seem fresh and original, and by exceeding our expectations, each innovation becomes an exciting surprise.",
		"One of the most widespread, and sadly mistaken, environmental myths is that living “close to nature” out in the country or in a leafy suburb is the best “green” lifestyle. Cities, on the other hand, are often blamed as a major cause of ecological destruction―artificial, crowded places that suck up precious resources. Yet, when you look at the facts, nothing could be farther from the truth. The pattern of life in the country and most suburbs involves long hours in the automobile each week, burning fuel and pumping out exhaust to get to work, buy groceries, and take kids to school and activities. City dwellers, on the other hand, have the option of walking or taking transit to work, shops, and school. The larger yards and houses found outside cities also create an environmental cost in terms of energy use, water use, and land use. It’s clear that the future of the Earth depends on more people gathering together in compact communities.",
		"Argument is “reason giving”, trying to convince others of your side of the issue. One makes claims and backs them up. The arguer tries to get others to “recognize the rightness” of his or her beliefs or actions. Interpersonal argumentation, then, has a place in our everyday conflicts and negotiations. One of the positive features of interpersonal arguments is that they are comprised of exchanges between two people who feel powerful enough to set forth reasons for their beliefs. If two people are arguing, it is because they are balanced enough in power (or in their desire to reestablish a power balance) to proceed. Lack of argument, in fact, may show that one of the parties feels so powerless that he or she avoids engaging directly with the other.",
		"In a highly commercialized setting such as the United States, it is not surprising that many landscapes are seen as commodities. In other words, they are valued because of their market potential. Residents develop an identity in part based on how the landscape can generate income for the community. This process involves more than the conversion of the natural elements into commodities. The landscape itself, including the people and their sense of self, takes on the form of a commodity. Over time, the landscape identity can evolve into a sort of “logo” that can be used to sell the stories of the landscape. Thus, California’s “Wine Country,” Florida’s “Sun Coast,” or South Dakota’s “Badlands” shape how both outsiders and residents perceive a place, and these labels build a set of expectations associated with the culture of those who live there.",
		"Cyber attacks on air traffic control systems have become a leading security concern. The federal government released a report in 2009 stating that the nation’s air traffic control system is vulnerable to a cyber attack that could interrupt communication with pilots and alter the flight information used to separate aircraft as they approach an airport. The report found numerous security problems in airline computer systems, including easy­to­crack passwords and unencrypted file folders, issues that could give invaders easy access. A cyber attack on air traffic has the potential to kill many people and could cripple the country’s entire airline industry. Tightening airline computer security could be even more important than conducting security screenings of passengers, because in an increasingly cyber­oriented world, plane hijackers of the future may not even be on board.",
		"Research has shown that individuals—especially those who have benefited from a particular system—are prone to support and rationalize the status quo, even if there are clear problems. These people justify systemic inequity with familiar phrases like “If you just work hard enough you can pull yourself up by your bootstraps.” A branch of psychology called system justification theory describes how people tend to see social, economic, and political systems as good, fair, and legitimate if they have succeeded as a result of those systems. According to Erin Godfrey, a professor of applied psychology at New York University, “The people who are at the top want to believe in meritocracy because it means that they deserve their successes.” Those who are in an advantaged position in society are more likely to believe the system is fair and see no reason to change it.",
		"Kinship ties continue to be important today. In modern societies such as the United States people frequently have family get-togethers, they telephone their relatives regularly, and they provide their kin with a wide variety of services. Eugene Litwak has referred to this pattern of behaviour as the ‘modified extended family’. It is an extended family structure because multigenerational ties are maintained, but it is modified because it does not usually rest on co-residence between the generations and most extended families do not act as corporate groups. Although modified extended family members often live close by, the modified extended family does not require geographical proximity and ties are maintained even when kin are separated by considerable distances. In contrast to the traditional extended family where kin always live in close proximity, the members of modified extended families may freely move away from kin to seek opportunities for occupational advancement.",
		"While we believe we hold the power to raise our children, the reality is that our children hold the power to raise us into the parents they need us to become. For this reason, the parenting experience isn’t one of parent versus child but of parent with child. The road to wholeness sits in our children’s lap, and all we need do is take a seat. As our children show us our way back to our own essence, they become our greatest awakeners. If we fail to hold their hand and follow their lead as they guide us through the gateway of increased consciousness, we lose the chance to walk toward our own enlightenment.",
		"A variety of theoretical perspectives provide insight into immigration. Economics, which assumes that actors engage in utility maximization, represents one framework. From this perspective, it is assumed that individuals are rational actors, i.e., that they make migration decisions based on their assessment of the costs as well as benefits of remaining in a given area versus the costs and benefits of leaving. Benefits may include but are not limited to short-term and long-term monetary gains, safety, and greater freedom of cultural expression. Individual costs include but are not limited to the expense of travel, uncertainty of living in a foreign land, difficulty of adapting to a different language, uncertainty about a different culture, and the great concern about living in a new land. Psychic costs associated with separation from family, friends, and the fear of the unknown also should be taken into account in cost-benefit assessments.",
		"A group of academics, mainly political scientists, assumed that human rights treaties did not have any effect on the behavior of countries. Indeed, these academics, who typically called themselves “realists,” assumed that international law generally did not affect the behavior of states. They saw the international arena as a security competition among different states, a zero­sum game in which one state’s gain was another state’s loss. In such conditions, states could gain little by cooperating with each other─except in temporary military alliances or security agreements that could fall apart at a moment’s notice. International law could play a minimal role or none at all, and was perhaps just an illusion, a sophisticated kind of propaganda─a set of rules that would be swept away whenever the balance of power changed.",
		"When approaching practical music making for the first time in the classroom, it is a good idea to avoid using instruments altogether. This will allow an inexperienced teacher to focus on the development of fundamental musical behaviour through listening, performing and composing; and allow the children to focus on the more controllable sound sources i.e. voices and body percussion (clapping, clicking, stamping etc). Music starts with these both developmentally and historically: the most expressive and immediate musical instrument is the human voice. Body movements are not only an instinctive response to music but also instigate music making. Activities which develop many of the coordination skills, aural sensitivity, responses to visual cues and symbols, and the musical understanding necessary to play an instrument can all be established without instruments.",
		"What characterizes philosophy and science in early modern Europe and marks a break from earlier traditions is the concern to tailor theories to evidence rather than authority or tradition. Galileo Galilei, Francis Bacon, René Descartes, and others formulated explanations of the heavens, of the natural world around them, and of human nature and society not by appealing to the proclamations of earlier thinkers. Nor were religious principles and ecclesiastic dogma their guiding lights. Rather, they took their lead from reason―what some thinkers called “the light of nature”―and experience. Whether they proceeded according to the logic of deduction or through the analysis of empirical data, the modern scientific method they developed consists in testing theories according to reason and in light of the available evidence.",
		"The animal in a conflict between attacking a rival and fleeing may initially not have sufficient information to enable it to make a decision straight away. If the rival is likely to win the fight, then the optimal decision would be to give up immediately and not risk getting injured. But if the rival is weak and easily defeatable, then there could be considerable benefit in going ahead and obtaining the territory, females, food or whatever is at stake. By taking a little extra time to collect information about the opponent, the animal is more likely to reach a decision that maximizes its chances of winning than if it takes a decision without such information. Many signals are now seen as having this information gathering or ‘assessment’ function, directly contributing to the mechanism of the decision-making process by supplying vital information about the likely outcomes of the various options.",
		"Some forms of energy are more versatile in their usefulness than others. For example, we can use electricity for a myriad of applications, whereas the heat from burning coal is currently used mostly for stationary applications like generating power. When we turn the heat from burning coal into electricity, a substantial amount of energy is lost due to the inefficiency of the process. But we are willing to accept that loss because coal is relatively cheap, and it would be difficult and inconvenient to use burning coal directly to power lights, computers, and refrigerators. In effect, we put a differing value on different forms of energy, with electricity at the top of the value ladder, liquid and gaseous fuels in the middle, and coal or firewood at the bottom. Solar and wind technologies have an advantage in that they produce high­value electricity directly.",
		"Because plants tend to recover from disasters more quickly than animals, they are essential to the revitalization of damaged environments. Why do plants have this preferential ability to recover from disaster? It is largely because, unlike animals, they can generate new organs and tissues throughout their life cycle. This ability is due to the activity of plant meristems―regions of undifferentiated tissue in roots and shoots that can, in response to specific cues, differentiate into new tissues and organs. If meristems are not damaged during disasters, plants can recover and ultimately transform the destroyed or barren environment. You can see this phenomenon on a smaller scale when a tree struck by lightning forms new branches that grow from the old scar. In addition to regeneration or resprouting of plants, disturbed areas can also recover through reseeding.",
		"Except for grains and sugars, most foods humans eat are perishable. They deteriorate in palatability, spoil, or become unhealthy when stored for long periods. Surplus animal and crop harvests, however, can be saved for future use if appropriate methods of preservation are used. The major ways of preserving foods are canning, freezing, drying, salting, and smoking. With all methods the aim is to kill or restrict the growth of harmful microbes or their toxins and to slow or inactivate enzymes that cause undesirable changes in food palatability. For further protection during long periods of storage, preserved food is placed either in sterile metal cans or glass jars or frozen in airtight paper or plastic containers.",
		"According to the principle of social proof, one way individuals determine appropriate behavior for themselves in a situation is to examine the behavior of others there— especially similar others. It is through social comparison with these referent others that people validate the correctness of their opinions and decisions. Consequently, people tend to behave as their friends and peers have behaved. Because the critical source of information within the principle of social proof is the responses of referent others, compliance tactics that employ this information should be especially effective in collectivistically oriented nations and persons. Some evidence in this regard comes from a study showing that advertisements that promoted group benefits were more persuasive in Korea (a collectivistic society) than in the United States (an individualistic society).",
		"One of the branches of postmodernism examines the structure of language and how it is used. It challenges the assumption that language can be precisely used to represent reality. Meanings of words are ambiguous, as words are only signs or labels given to concepts (what is signified) and therefore there is no necessary correspondence between the word and the meaning, the signifier and the signified. The use of signs (words) and their meaning can vary depending on the flow of the text in which they are used, leading to the possibility of ‘deconstructing’ text to reveal its underlying inconsistencies. This approach can be applied to all forms of representation― pictures, films, etc. that gain added or alternative meanings by the overlaying of references to previous uses. This can be seen particularly in the media, where it is difficult to distinguish the real from the unreal―everything is representation, there is no reality.",
		"Interestingly, experts do not suffer as much as beginners when performing complex tasks or combining multiple tasks. Because experts have extensive practice within a limited domain, the key component skills in their domain tend to be highly practiced and more automated. Each of these highly practiced skills then demands relatively few cognitive resources, effectively lowering the total cognitive load that experts experience. Thus, experts can perform complex tasks and combine multiple tasks relatively easily. This is not because they necessarily have more cognitive resources than beginners; rather, because of the high level of fluency they have achieved in performing key skills, they can do more with what they have. Beginners, on the other hand, have not achieved the same degree of fluency and automaticity in each of the component skills, and thus they struggle to combine skills that experts combine with relative ease and efficiency.",
		"The written word is the obvious, and easiest, place to start when exploring local history, if only to see what has already been written on the subject. Local history books have been written for centuries and are very variable in quality. These books will certainly not mention your ancestor by name unless they played a particularly prominent part in the development of the locality in question. However, they do provide information about how a place changed over time, who the major personalities were and the significant events that occurred there; or at least those selected by the author for inclusion. Unless a book is extremely large or the district chosen is very small, then the author must choose very carefully what he is to include and their priorities may not be the same as all their readers. It is well worth reading some or preferably all of the books written about a locality that your ancestors lived in.",
		"Although organizations are offering telecommuting programs in greater numbers than ever before, acceptance and use of these programs are still limited by a number of factors. These factors include manager reliance on face-to-face management practices, lack of telecommuting training within an organization, misperceptions of and discomfort with flexible workplace programs, and a lack of information about the effects of telecommuting on an organization’s bottom line. Despite these limitations, at the beginning of the 21st century, a new “anytime, anywhere” work culture is emerging. Continuing advances in information technology, the expansion of a global workforce, and increased desire to balance work and family are only three of the many factors that will gradually reduce the current barriers to telecommuting as a dominant workforce development. With implications for organizational cost savings, especially with regard to lower facility costs, increased employee flexibility, and productivity, telecommuting is increasingly of interest to many organizations.",
		"Several common themes were found in the highly creative individuals regarding their early experiences and education. In early childhood their families accorded them a great deal of respect and allowed them to explore on their own and develop a strong sense of personal autonomy. There was also a lack of extreme emotional closeness with parents. There was little evidence of intensely negative experiences; for example there was, relative to the times in which they lived, very little physical punishment for transgressions. Nor, on the positive side, was there evidence of extremely intense bonds of the sort that can smother independence. On balance, for those who would grow up to be highly creative, relationships with parents were relatively easy and, in later life, pleasant and friendly rather than intensely intimate.",
		"No doubt students collaborating with other speakers of English might encounter language variances, which may interfere with intentionality. To address such disparities, Horner, Lu, Royster, and Trimbur (2011) call for a “translingual approach” in which language varieties are not perceived as barriers, but as avenues for meaning making.  S i m i larly, Galloway and Rose (2015) study of Global Englishes found that exposure to other Englishes helps normalize language differences. Educators have to work with students to examine phrases, expressions, and other ranges of English language use for their rhetorical and communicative possibilities and not their perceived errors or inferior status. After all, students are constantly reading texts and listening to speakers whose Englishes do not necessarily conform to what is considered standard in their own communities.",
		"Doctors Without Borders, also known as Médecins Sans Frontières or MSF, was founded in 1971 by a small group of French doctors. They believed that all people have the right to medical care regardless of race, religion, gender, and political belief. It was the first non-governmental organization to provide emergency medical assistance. A private, nonprofit organization, MSF is at the forefront of emergency health care as well as care for populations suffering from endemic diseases. It provides primary health care, performs surgery, runs nutrition programs, trains local medical personnel, and provides mental health care. Through longer-term programs, this organization treats chronic diseases such as malaria, sleeping sickness, and AIDS; and brings health care to remote, isolated areas where resources and training are limited.",
		"Have you ever done something absent­minded like throwing the peeled potato into the bin and the peelings into the pot? How about sending an email saying there is a document attached without actually attaching the document? Everyday mistakes like these happen all the time because our brains have to keep track of hundreds of different responses to thousands of different potential stimuli every hour of our waking lives. Even though a second earlier we wrote that we were attaching a document to the email, the very next second our brain gives a command to our fingers to send the attachment­less email. Sometimes we don’t even realize our mistake until we get an email from the addressee pointing it out.",
		"As far back as the seventeenth century, hair had a special spiritual significance in Africa. Many African cultures saw the head as the center of control, communication, and identity in the body. Hair was regarded as a source of power that personified the individual and could be used for spiritual purposes or even to cast a spell. Since it rests on the highest point on the body, hair itself was a means to communicate with divine spirits and it was treated in ways that were thought to bring good luck or protect against evil. According to authors Ayana Byrd and Lori Tharps, “communication from the gods and spirits was thought to pass through the hair to get to the soul.” In Cameroon, for example, medicine men attached hair to containers that held their healing potions in order to protect the potions and enhance their effectiveness.",
		"We are the only species that seasons its food, deliberately altering it with the highly flavored plant parts we call herbs and spices. It’s quite possible that our taste for spices has an evolutionary root. Many spices have antibacterial properties—in fact, common seasonings such as garlic, onion, and oregano inhibit the growth of almost every bacterium tested. And the cultures that make the heaviest use of spices—think of the garlic and black pepper of Thai food, the ginger and coriander of India, the chili peppers of Mexico—come from warmer climates, where bacterial spoilage is a bigger issue. In contrast, the most lightly spiced cuisines—those of Scandinavia and northern Europe—are from cooler climates. Our uniquely human attention to flavor, in this case the flavor of spices, turns out to have arisen as a matter of life and death.",
		"You would think all bicycles must have brakes. But the bicycles used for track racing are built without brakes. A track racing bicycle has only essential parts to keep its weight down. So, how do you stop it? This is where the gloves come in. The racer backpedals, and then holds the front wheel tight with his hands. This stops the wheel from spinning, and the bicycle comes to a stop. No wonder track bicycle racers wear gloves! If they didn’t, their hands would get terribly hurt every time they tried to stop.",
		"In the late 1960s, a television producer, Joan Cooney, started an epidemic. She targeted children between three and five. Her agent of infection was television and the “virus” she wanted to spread was literacy. The show would be an hour long and run 5 days a week in hopes that it would become contagious enough to improve education. Her aim was to spread positive learning values to all children and even their parents. She also intended for it to give advantages to children with fewer opportunities once they began elementary school. What she wanted to do, in essence, was create a learning epidemic to fight the wide­spread epidemics of poverty and illiteracy. She called her idea Sesame Street.",
		"Over time, I have become increasingly aware that the world is divided into people who wait for others to give them permission to do the things they want to do and people who grant themselves permission. Some look inside themselves for motivation and others wait to be pushed forward by outside forces. From my experience, there is a lot to be said for seizing opportunities instead of waiting for someone to hand them to you. There are always white spaces ready to be filled and golden nuggets of opportunities lying on the ground waiting for someone to pick them up. Sometimes it means looking beyond your own desk, outside your building, across the street, or around the corner. But the nuggets are there for the taking by anyone willing to gather them up.",
		"Several studies have found that pet owners have lower blood pressure, a reduced risk of heart disease, and lower levels of stress. Pets can also be a plus in the workplace. A study found that in the course of workday, stress levels decreased for workers who brought in their dogs. The differences in perceived stress between days the dog was present and absent were significant. The employees as a whole had a higher job satisfaction than industry norms. Having a dog in the office had a positive effect on the general atmosphere, relieving stress and making everyone around happier. Pet presence may serve as a low-cost wellness solution readily available to many organizations.",
		"Dr. John Ross was well­known for helping his patients. Many of his patients were poor farmers, and they could not always afford to pay Dr. Ross’s small fee. The good doctor would accept vegetables, eggs, or even a simple “thank you” in payment. One winter afternoon, he went to a house to see a child with a fever. The girl’s family had run out of the firewood they needed to keep their tiny house warm. Dr. Ross grabbed a spare blanket from his car and told the father to bathe his daughter’s forehead with cool water. Then Dr. Ross left to take care of other patients. After setting a broken leg, delivering a baby, and cleaning an infected finger, he returned to the sick child’s house with a load of firewood. He built a fire for the little girl and her family.",
		"Language skills, like any other skills, can be acquired only through practice. In the case of the mother tongue, the child gets sufficient scope for this practice in his daily environment. And he has so many teachers: his parents, other members of the family, friends, relatives―almost everyone with whom he comes in contact in his day-to-day life. He also has the strongest motivation or urge to learn the language, for if he cannot express himself in his mother tongue, some of his basic needs are likely to remain unfulfilled. And what is perhaps most remarkable, the child practices the language without being conscious of the fact that he is learning a highly complex code.",
		"Consider an innocent question asked years ago by a son to his father: “Who invented the automobile?” Trying to be instructive, the father told his son that in about 1886 Karl Benz invented the automobile. “Wow, he must have been a real genius to figure out the engine, the brakes, the spark plugs, the wheels, and how everything worked together!” “Well, someone else invented the tires; I think it was Firestone. And then there was even the person who invented the wheel......” But then he experienced a moment of realization. “I think I may have misled you. No one person invented all of the components of the automobile. Many people made significant discoveries that led to the invention of the automobile.”",
		"We have all had the experience of suddenly noticing that a source of constant background noise, such as a distant jackhammer or music from a store, has just ceased―yet we hadn’t noticed the sound while it was ongoing. Your auditory areas were predicting its continuation, moment after moment, and as long as the noise didn’t change you paid it no attention. By ceasing, it violated your prediction and attracted your attention. Here’s a historical example. Right after New York City stopped running elevated trains, people called the police in the middle of the night claiming that something woke them up. They tended to call around the time the trains used to run past their apartments.",
		"You might have heard of such stories of expert intuition: the chess master who walks past a street game and announces “White mates in three” without stopping, or the physician who makes a complex diagnosis after a single glance at a patient. Expert intuition strikes us as magical, but it is not. Indeed, each of us performs feats of intuitive expertise many times each day. Most of us are pitch-perfect in detecting anger in the first word of a telephone call and recognize as we enter a room that we were the subject of the conversation. Our everyday intuitive abilities are no less marvelous than the striking insights of an experienced chess master or physician ―only more common.",
		"Give children options and allow them to make their own decisions―on how much they would like to eat, whether they want to eat or not, and what they would like to have. For example, include them in the decision­making process of what you are thinking of making for dinner―“Lisa, would you like to have pasta and meatballs, or chicken and a baked potato?” When discussing how much they should eat during dinner, serve them a reasonable amount; if they claim they are still “hungry” after they are through, ask them to wait five to ten minutes, and if they continue to feel hunger, then they can have a second plate of food. These are fantastic behaviors that, when taught properly, teach brilliant self­confidence and self­control.",
		"On college campuses in the U.S. and around the world, some animals are helping students in need. With many students reporting depression and anxiety, school officials arrange pet therapy events to spread cheer and fight stress, especially during exams. These are not service animals trained to help people with disabilities; most are the pets of volunteers. Their visits are obviously beneficial: Research shows that contact with pets can decrease blood pressure and stress­hormone levels and increase so­called happiness hormones. Mary Callahan, a director at Pet Partners, considers pet visits on campus a great way to support students on their path to success.",
		"In 2000, the government in Glasgow, Scotland, appeared to stumble on a remarkable crime prevention strategy. Officials hired a team to beautify the city by installing a series of blue lights in various noticeable locations. In theory, blue lights are more attractive and calming than the yellow and white lights that illuminate much of the city at night, and indeed the blue lights seemed to cast a soothing glow. Months passed and the city’s crime statisticians noticed a striking trend: The locations that were newly bathed in blue experienced a dramatic decline in criminal activity. The blue lights in Glasgow, which mimicked the lights atop police cars, seemed to imply that the police were always watching. The lights were never designed to reduce crime, but that’s exactly what they appeared to be doing.",
		"In the history of sports and in our ‘winning is everything’ culture, I’m not aware of anyone who ever won every game, or every event, or every championship they competed for. Roger Federer, the great tennis player who some call the greatest of all time, has won a record seventeen Grand Slam titles. Yet, he has competed in more than sixty Grand Slam events. Thus, perhaps the greatest tennis player ever failed more than two-thirds of the time. While we don’t think of him as a failure, but rather as a champion, the plain fact is, he failed much more than he succeeded on this measure, and that’s generally the way things are for anyone. Failure precedes success. Simply accept that failure is part of the process and get on with it.",
		"Studies from cities all over the world show the importance of life and activity as an urban attraction. People gather where things are happening and seek the presence of other people. Faced with the choice of walking down an empty or a lively street, most people would choose the street with life and activity. The walk will be more interesting and feel safer. Events where we can watch people perform or play music attract many people to stay and watch. Studies of benches and chairs in city space show that the seats with the best view of city life are used far more frequently than those that do not offer a view of other people.",
		"Consumers are generally uncomfortable with taking high risks. As a result, they are usually motivated to use a lot of strategies to reduce risk. Consumers can collect additional information by conducting online research, reading news articles, talking to friends or consulting an expert. Consumers also reduce uncertainty by buying the same brand that they did the last time, believing that the product should be at least as satisfactory as their last purchase. In addition, some consumers may employ a simple decision rule that results in a safer choice. For example, someone might buy the most expensive offering or choose a heavily advertised brand in the belief that this brand has higher quality than other brands.",
		"Many people suppose that to keep bees, it is necessary to have a large garden in the country; but this is a mistake. Bees will, of course, do better in the midst of fruit blossoms in May and white clovers in June than in a city where they have to fly a long distance to reach the open fields. However, bees can be kept with profit even under unfavorable circumstances. Bees do very well in the suburbs of large cities since the series of flowers in the gardens of the villas allow a constant supply of honey from early spring until autumn. Therefore, almost every person―except those who are seriously afraid of bees―can keep them profitably and enjoyably.",
		"Overprotective parents spare kids from all natural consequences. Unfortunately, their kids often lack a clear understanding of the reasons behind their parents’ rules. They never learn how to bounce back from failure or how to recover from mistakes because their parents prevented them from making poor choices. Rather than learning, “I should wear a jacket because it’s cold outside,” a child may conclude, “I have to wear a jacket because my mom makes me.” Without an opportunity to experience real­world consequences, kids don’t always understand why their parents make certain rules. Natural consequences prepare children for adulthood by helping them think about the potential consequences of their choices.",
		"How can we teach our children to memorize a broad range of information? Let me prove to you that all people are potential geniuses, with brains designed to store, control, and remember large amounts of information through memorization by repetition. Imagine the grocery store where you shop the most. If I asked you to tell me where the eggs are, would you be able to do so? Of course you could. The average grocery store carries over 10,000 items, yet you can quickly tell me where to find most of them. Why? The store is organized by category, and you have shopped in the store repeatedly. In other words, you’ve seen those organized items over and over again, and the arrangement by category makes it easy for you to memorize the store’s layout. You can categorize 10,000 items from just one store.",
		"Mammals tend to be less colorful than other animal groups, but zebras are strikingly dressed in black­and­white. What purpose do such high contrast patterns serve? The colors’ roles aren’t always obvious. The question of what zebras can gain from having stripes has puzzled scientists for more than a century. To try to solve this mystery, wildlife biologist Tim Caro spent more than a decade studying zebras in Tanzania. He ruled out theory after theory―stripes don’t keep them cool, stripes don’t confuse predators―before finding an answer. In 2013, he set up fly traps covered in zebra skin and, for comparison, others covered in antelope skin. He saw that flies seemed to avoid landing on the stripes. After more research, he concluded that stripes can literally save zebras from disease­carrying insects.",
		"If you want to protect yourself from colds and flu, regular exercise may be the ultimate immunity­booster. Studies have shown that moderate aerobic exercise can more than halve your risk for respiratory infections and other common winter diseases. But when you feel sick, the story changes. “Exercise is great for prevention, but it can be lousy for therapy,” says David Nieman, the director of the Human Performance Lab. Research shows that moderate exercise has no effect on the duration or severity of the common cold. If you have the flu or other forms of fever­causing systemic infections, exercise can slow recovery and, therefore, is a bad idea. Your immune system is working overtime to fight off the infection, and exercise, a form of physical stress, makes that task harder.",
		"In a competitive environment, such as a college admissions process or a job application situation, almost everyone has strong qualifications. Almost everyone has facts in their favor. But how valuable are facts alone? Think back to the most recent lecture or presentation you attended. How many facts do you remember from it? If you’re like most people, you can’t recall many, if any. Chances are good, however, that you remember stories, anecdotes, and examples from the event, even if you can’t think of their exact context. The average person today is flooded with facts and data, and we let most of this pass through our brains with minimal retention or reaction ―unless something makes the information stand out in a meaningful way. That’s where story comes in.",
		"Simply providing students with complex texts is not enough for learning to happen. Assigning students to independently read, think about, and then write about a complex text is not enough, either. Quality questions are one way that teachers can check students’ understanding of the text. Questions can also promote students’ search for evidence and their need to return to the text to deepen their understanding. Teachers take an active role in developing and deepening students’ comprehension by asking questions that cause them to read the text again, resulting in multiple readings of the same text. In other words, these text­based questions provide students with a purpose for rereading, which is critical for understanding complex texts.",
		"Near an honesty box, in which people placed coffee fund contributions, researchers at Newcastle University in the UK alternately displayed images of eyes and of flowers. Each image was displayed for a week at a time. During all the weeks in which eyes were displayed, bigger contributions were made than during the weeks when flowers were displayed. Over the ten weeks of the study, contributions during the ‘eyes weeks’ were almost three times higher than those made during the ‘flowers weeks.’ It was suggested that ‘the evolved psychology of cooperation is highly sensitive to subtle cues of being watched,’ and that the findings may have implications for how to provide effective nudges toward socially beneficial outcomes.",
		"Benjamin Franklin once suggested that a newcomer to a neighborhood ask a new neighbor to do him or her a favor, citing an old maxim: He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another than he whom you yourself have obliged. In Franklin’s opinion, asking someone for something was the most useful and immediate invitation to social interaction. Such asking on the part of the newcomer provided the neighbor with an opportunity to show himself or herself as a good person, at first encounter. It also meant that the latter could now ask the former for a favor, in return, increasing the familiarity and trust. In that manner, both parties could overcome their natural hesitancy and mutual fear of the stranger.",
		"It is said that among the Bantu peoples of Central Africa, when an individual from one tribe meets someone from a different group, they ask, “What do you dance?” Throughout time, communities have forged their identities through dance rituals that mark major events in the life of individuals, including birth, marriage, and death―as well as religious festivals and important points in the seasons. The social structure of many communities, from African tribes to Spanish gypsies, and to Scottish clans, gains much cohesion from the group activity of dancing. Historically, dance has been a strong, binding influence on community life, a means of expressing the social identity of the group, and participation allows individuals to demonstrate a belonging. As a consequence, in many regions of the world there are as many types of dances as there are communities with distinct identities.",
		"In life, they say that too much of anything is not good for you. In fact, too much of certain things in life can kill you. For example, they say that water has no enemy, because water is essential to all life. But if you take in too much water, like one who is drowning, it could kill you. Education is the exception to this rule. You can never have too much education or knowledge. The reality is that most people will never have enough education in their lifetime. I am yet to find that one person who has been hurt in life by too much education. Rather, we see lots of casualties every day, worldwide, resulting from the lack of education. You must keep in mind that education is a long­term investment of time, money, and effort into humans.",
		"Every event that causes you to smile makes you feel happy and produces feel‒good chemicals in your brain. Force your face to smile even when you are stressed or feel unhappy. The facial muscular pattern produced by the smile is linked to all the “happy networks” in your brain and will in turn naturally calm you down and change your brain chemistry by releasing the same feel‒good chemicals. Researchers studied the effects of a genuine and forced smile on individuals during a stressful event. The researchers had participants perform stressful tasks while not smiling, smiling, or holding chopsticks crossways in their mouths (to force the face to form a smile). The results of the study showed that smiling, forced or genuine, during stressful events reduced the intensity of the stress response in the body and lowered heart rate levels after recovering from the stress.",
		"The loss of many traditional jobs in everything from art to healthcare will partly be offset by the creation of new human jobs. Primary care doctors who focus on diagnosing known diseases and giving familiar treatments will probably be replaced by AI doctors. But precisely because of that, there will be much more money to pay human doctors and lab assistants to do groundbreaking research and develop new medicines or surgical procedures. AI might help create new human jobs in another way. Instead of humans competing with AI, they could focus on servicing and using AI. For example, the replacement of human pilots by drones has eliminated some jobs but created many new opportunities in maintenance, remote control, data analysis, and cyber security.",
		"Chewing leads to smaller particles for swallowing, and more exposed surface area for digestive enzymes to act on. In other words, it means the extraction of more fuel and raw materials from a mouthful of food. This is especially important for mammals because they heat their bodies from within. Chewing gives mammals the energy needed to be active not only during the day but also the cool night, and to live in colder climates or places with changing temperatures. It allows them to sustain higher levels of activity and travel speeds to cover larger distances, avoid predators, capture prey, and make and care for their young. Mammals are able to live in an incredible variety of habitats, from Arctic tundra to Antarctic pack ice, deep open waters to high-altitude mountaintops, and rainforests to deserts, in no small measure because of their teeth.",
		"Think, for a moment, about something you bought that you never ended up using. An item of clothing you never ended up wearing? A book you never read? Some piece of electronic equipment that never even made it out of the box? It is estimated that Australians alone spend on average $10.8 billion AUD (approximately $9.99 billion USD) every year on goods they do not use—more than the total government spending on universities and roads. That is an average of $1,250 AUD (approximately $1,156 USD) for each household. All the things we buy that then just sit there gathering dust are waste—a waste of money, a waste of time, and waste in the sense of pure rubbish. As the author Clive Hamilton observes, ‘The difference between the stuff we buy and what we use is waste.’",
		"When people think about the development of cities, rarely do they consider the critical role of vertical transportation. In fact, each day, more than 7 billion elevator journeys are taken in tall buildings all over the world. Efficient vertical transportation can expand our ability to build taller and taller skyscrapers. Antony Wood, a Professor of Architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology, explains that advances in elevators over the past 20 years are probably the greatest advances we have seen in tall buildings. For example, elevators in the Jeddah Tower in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, under construction, will reach a height record of 660m.",
		"Diversity, challenge, and conflict help us maintain our imagination. Most people assume that conflict is bad and that being in one’s “comfort zone” is good. That is not exactly true. Of course, we don’t want to find ourselves without a job or medical insurance or in a fight with our partner, family, boss, or coworkers. One bad experience can be sufficient to last us a lifetime. But small disagreements with family and friends, trouble with technology or finances, or challenges at work and at home can help us think through our own capabilities. Problems that need solutions force us to use our brains in order to develop creative answers. Navigating landscapes that are varied, that offer trials and occasional conflicts, is more helpful to creativity than hanging out in landscapes that pose no challenge to our senses and our minds. Our two million­year history is packed with challenges and conflicts.",
		"In modern times, society became more dynamic. Social mobility increased, and people began to exercise a higher degree of choice regarding, for instance, their profession, their marriage, or their religion. This posed a challenge to traditional roles in society. It was less evident that one needed to commit to the roles one was born into when alternatives could be realized. Increasing control over one’s life choices became not only possible but desired. Identity then became a problem. It was no longer almost ready-made at birth but something to be discovered. Traditional role identities prescribed by society began to appear as masks imposed on people whose real self was to be found somewhere underneath.",
		"Our ability to accurately recognize and label emotions is often referred to as emotional granularity. In the words of Harvard psychologist Susan David, “Learning to label emotions with a more nuanced vocabulary can be absolutely transformative.” David explains that if we don’t have a rich emotional vocabulary, it is difficult to communicate our needs and to get the support that we need from others. But those who are able to distinguish between a range of various emotions “do much, much better at managing the ups and downs of ordinary existence than those who see everything in black and white.” In fact, research shows that the process of labeling emotional experience is related to greater emotion regulation and psychosocial well­being.",
		"Only a generation or two ago, mentioning the word algorithms would have drawn a blank from most people. Today, algorithms appear in every part of civilization. They are connected to everyday life. They’re not just in your cell phone or your laptop but in your car, your house, your appliances, and your toys. Your bank is a huge web of algorithms, with humans turning the switches here and there. Algorithms schedule flights and then fly the airplanes. Algorithms run factories, trade goods, and keep records. If every algorithm suddenly stopped working, it would be the end of the world as we know it.",
		"Many people make a mistake of only operating along the safe zones, and in the process they miss the opportunity to achieve greater things. They do so because of a fear of the unknown and a fear of treading the unknown paths of life. Those that are brave enough to take those roads less travelled are able to get great returns and derive major satisfaction out of their courageous moves. Being overcautious will mean that you will miss attaining the greatest levels of your potential. You must learn to take those chances that many people around you will not take, because your success will flow from those bold decisions that you will take along the way.",
		"Have you ever brought up an idea or suggestion to someone and heard them immediately say “No, that won’t work.”? You may have thought, “He/she didn’t even give it a chance. How do they know it won’t work?” When you are right about something, you close off the possibility of another viewpoint or opportunity. Being right about something means that “it is the way it is, period.” You may be correct. Your particular way of seeing it may be true with the facts. However, considering the other option or the other person’s point of view can be beneficial. If you see their side, you will see something new or, at worse, learn something about how the other person looks at life. Why would you think everyone sees and experiences life the way you do? Besides how boring that would be, it would eliminate all new opportunities, ideas, invention, and creativity.",
		"Success can lead you off your intended path and into a comfortable rut. If you are good at something and are well rewarded for doing it, you may want to keep doing it even if you stop enjoying it. The danger is that one day you look around and realize you’re so deep in this comfortable rut that you can no longer see the sun or breathe fresh air; the sides of the rut have become so slippery that it would take a superhuman effort to climb out; and, effectively, you’re stuck. And it’s a situation that many working people worry they’re in now. The poor employment market has left them feeling locked in what may be a secure, or even well­paying—but ultimately unsatisfying—job.",
		"Few people will be surprised to hear that poverty tends to create stress: a 2006 study published in the American journal Psychosomatic Medicine, for example, noted that a lower socioeconomic status was associated with higher levels of stress hormones in the body. However, richer economies have their own distinct stresses. The key issue is time pressure. A 1999 study of 31 countries by American psychologist Robert Levine and Canadian psychologist Ara Norenzayan found that wealthier, more industrialized nations had a faster pace of life—which led to a higher standard of living, but at the same time left the population feeling a constant sense of urgency, as well as being more prone to heart disease. In effect, fast­paced productivity creates wealth, but it also leads people to feel time­poor when they lack the time to relax and enjoy themselves.",
		"We think we are shaping our buildings. But really, our buildings and development are also shaping us. One of the best examples of this is the oldest­known construction: the ornately carved rings of standing stones at Göbekli Tepe in Turkey. Before these ancestors got the idea to erect standing stones some 12,000 years ago, they were hunter­gatherers. It appears that the erection of the multiple rings of megalithic stones took so long, and so many successive generations, that these innovators were forced to settle down to complete the construction works. In the process, they became the first farming society on Earth. This is an early example of a society constructing something that ends up radically remaking the society itself. Things are not so different in our own time.",
		"Kids tire of their toys, college students get sick of cafeteria food, and sooner or later most of us lose interest in our favorite TV shows. The bottom line is that we humans are easily bored. But why should this be true? The answer lies buried deep in our nerve cells, which are designed to reduce their initial excited response to stimuli each time they occur. At the same time, these neurons enhance their responses to things that change― especially things that change quickly. We probably evolved this way because our ancestors got more survival value, for example, from attending to what was moving in a tree (such as a puma) than to the tree itself. Boredom in reaction to an unchanging environment turns down the level of neural excitation so that new stimuli (like our ancestor’s hypothetical puma threat) stand out more. It’s the neural equivalent of turning off a front door light to see the fireflies.",
		"Working around the whole painting, rather than concentrating on one area at a time, will mean you can stop at any point and the painting can be considered “finished.” Artists often find it difficult to know when to stop painting, and it can be tempting to keep on adding more to your work. It is important to take a few steps back from the painting from time to time to assess your progress. Putting too much into a painting can spoil its impact and leave it looking overworked. If you find yourself struggling to decide whether you have finished, take a break and come back to it later with fresh eyes. Then you can decide whether any areas of your painting would benefit from further refinement.",
		"If you’ve ever visited a fortune­teller you probably came away amazed at the things they knew about you─things no one else could possibly have known. So it must be a supernatural power, right? Research into the fortune­telling business shows that fortune­tellers use a technique known as “cold reading,” which can produce an accuracy of around 80 percent when “reading” a person you’ve never met. While it can appear magical to some people, it is simply a process based on the careful observation of body­language signals plus an understanding of human nature and a knowledge of probability statistics. It’s a technique practiced by tarot­card readers, astrologers, and palm readers to gather information about a “client.”",
		"Each time a patient needs to have a wound dressing removed to check for infection, the healing process is interrupted and germs can get in. Now, a new dressing allows staff to tell if an infection is developing without even touching the patient. They only need to check a color strip on the outside of the dressing. The secret lies in a dye used in the dressing, which reacts to changing pH levels in the skin. “Healthy skin and healed wounds usually show a pH value of below 5,” says Dr. Sabine Trupp, a lead researcher at Munich’s Fraunhofer Research Institution, who developed the color strip. “If the pH value is between 6.5 and 8.5, an infection is frequently present and the indicator color strip turns purple.”",
		"Some species of prey are brightly colored all over, and do not show any tendency towards crypsis. It is a little puzzling that such prey have coloring that makes it very easy for predators to detect them. The puzzle is largely solved when it is realized that such prey are often distasteful. Evidence that it is useful for distasteful prey to be easily detected or conspicuous was reported by Gittleman and Harvey. Chicks were presented with breadcrumbs which had been made distasteful. Initially, the chicks ate more of the breadcrumb prey when they were easily detected rather than hard to detect. However, the conspicuous or easily detected prey were eaten much less than the cryptic prey later on. Presumably chicks find it easier to avoid distasteful prey when it is conspicuous than when it is cryptic.",
		"Paper is not only useful for preserving information. In its role as a wrapping material, paper also does a good job of hiding it. What would birthdays be like without this material, which performs the role of building excitement and anticipation better than all others? I have received presents wrapped in cloth, or hidden in a cupboard, but nothing has the magic of wrapping paper. A present really isn’t a present unless it is wrapped in a paper. It is the paper that, by concealing and revealing an object, ritualizes the act of giving and receiving, turning that object into a gift. This is not just a cultural association. The material has fundamental properties that make it ideal for this role.",
		"You might be surprised to learn that most kids would rather have parents that are a little too strict than not strict enough. When they make rules about your behavior, your parents are showing you they really care about the things you do. Learning about life is a little like learning to fly an airplane. Once you get in the air it’s exciting, but first you need to know which buttons to press and which ones to leave alone. If your flight instructor puts you in a plane and says, “Figure out the rules yourself. Good luck!” you know you’re in trouble. It’s the same with parents.",
		"If you watch airline attendants when flight safety instructions are being given, you’ll notice that they hold the life jacket, oxygen mask, and other demonstration materials like pieces of art being auctioned at Christie’s. Why? Because it draws attention to those items and conveys their importance. According to a large restaurant owner, his servers are taught to present trays of food to customers with both hands and with respect. Doing so leaves others with a more favorable impression of the server and the restaurant. The same principle applies to anything you hold while speaking in public. Whether it is a piece of paper, a workbook, or a product, if you want to let your audience know what you are holding is important, handle the item with respect and care.",
		"People are strongly influenced by irrelevant factors―the ones that speak to our unconscious desires and motivations. For example, in a study, subjects were given three different boxes of detergent and asked to try them all out, then report on which they liked best and why. One box was yellow, another blue, and the third was blue with splashes of yellow. The subjects overwhelmingly favored the detergent in the box with mixed colors. Their comments included much about the relative merits of the detergents, but none mentioned the box. Why should they? A pretty box doesn’t make the detergent work better. But in reality, it was just the box that differed―the detergents inside were all identical.",
		"For many young people, peers are of significant importance and can be the primary source of the norms with which they strive to conform. Peer pressure among them can affect how they drive a vehicle. Young drivers experience higher peer pressure than older drivers to commit traffic violations such as speeding, driving under the influence of alcohol and dangerous overtaking. Direct peer pressure may be exerted on a young driver’s behavior through the influence of a passenger. Young drivers, both male and female, drive faster and with a shorter following distance at road junctions if they have young passengers in the car.",
		"Anxiety has been around for thousands of years. According to evolutionary psychologists, it is adaptive to the extent that it helped our ancestors avoid situations in which the margin of error between life and death was slim. Anxiety warned people when their lives were in danger: not only from wild tigers, cave bears, hungry hyenas, and other animals stalking the landscape, but also from hostile, competing tribes. Being on alert helped ancient people fight predators, flee from enemies, or “freeze,” blending in, as if camouflaged, so they wouldn’t be noticed. It mobilized them to react to real threats to their survival. It pushed them into keeping their children out of harm’s way. Anxiety thus persisted through evolution in a majority of the population because it was (and can be) an advantageous, life­saving trait.",
		"Competition makes the world go round. It is the engine of evolution and the foundation of democracy. It prompts innovation, drives global markets, and puts money in the pocket. Still, there are those who have argued that competition is a source of evil. They see competition in terms of destructiveness: they don’t believe it’s a constructive activity. They assert that competition kills off more prosocial behaviors, such as cooperation and respect. The assumption that competition is the opposite of cooperation is missing something crucial. To compete, both opponents have to cooperate on the rules: there’s a mutual agreement of cooperation that governs the competition. As well, competitions are commonly among teams; each individual needs to cooperate with team members in order to compete effectively. Healthy competition can’t happen without cooperation. In fact, the hormones that drive us to compete are the same hormones that drive us to collaborate.",
		"Anne Mangen at the University of Oslo studied the performance of readers of a computer screen compared to readers of paper. Her investigation indicated that reading on a computer screen involves various strategies from browsing to simple word detection. Those different strategies together lead to poorer reading comprehension in contrast to reading the same texts on paper. Moreover, there is an additional feature of the screen: hypertext. Above all, a hypertext connection is not one that you have made yourself, and it will not necessarily have a place in your own unique conceptual framework. Therefore, it may not help you understand and digest what you’re reading at your own appropriate pace, and it may even distract you.",
		"A bridge is normally constructed to last one hundred years in a natural or manmade environment. Its presence makes a lasting mark that shows the evolution of society. It should, then, be an agreeable addition to the local environment. Therefore, one of the first qualities a bridge must exhibit concerns how it harmonizes with its surroundings. It must not upset the balance of the environment; it must either adapt to or indeed reinforce this balance. Depending on the type of bridge and the site, it is subordinate to the surroundings, or it makes a strong statement. In the latter case the bridge must possess an intrinsic beauty that works within its surroundings. It is not acceptable to create a bridge that is spectacular in itself but spoils its local environment.",
		"People who communicate to others about themselves rather freely, who are frank and open, who express their views, opinions, knowledge, and feelings freely, and who share their knowledge and personal experiences with others can be considered as the self­disclosing type. These people constantly communicate with others and make an impact on them. This communication or self­disclosure helps in generating data and such an individual has more of an open and public self than private self. Without an optimal amount of self­disclosure we deny an opportunity for others to know us and for ourselves to get appropriate feedback. People who don’t communicate openly are private individuals who may have difficulty discovering themselves fully. At least it is difficult for them to see themselves fully through the eyes of others and also they make limited impact on others.",
		"We have constructed so many large reservoirs to hold water, and they are located primarily in the Northern Hemisphere rather than randomly around the globe. As a result, enough of Earth’s mass has shifted to speed up its rotation. Currently, 88 huge reservoirs hold some 10 trillion tons of water. Before the reservoirs were built, this water was located in the ocean, which has most of its mass in the Southern Hemisphere. The effect is like a whirling skater who pulls her arms in to turn faster. Because natural factors in the environment, such as the pull of tides, are gradually slowing Earth’s rotation, the human influence is accidentally working against the natural rate of deceleration. The shift in Earth’s mass has also changed the location of the axis on which Earth rotates.",
		"Introducing recovery in all aspects of my life has transformed my overall experience. In four or five intensive hour­and­a­half sessions, each followed by at least fifteen minutes of recovery, I get just about as much done as I did previously in a twelve­hour marathon day. Taking one full day off every week makes me more productive overall rather than less so. And finally, I have come to see vacations as a good investment. Today, like a sprinter, I get as much work done as I did previously like a marathon runner―in a lot less time and with a lot more energy and positive emotions. I spend more time with my family and friends, and when I do, I am more present. There is no magic here; I am simply paying better attention to my human needs.",
		"Do you have trouble locating your computer screen amid the jungle of old coffee mugs and scattered papers? Or is your workspace a minimalist’s dream? Whether you’re neat or messy, your workspace may reveal a lot about your personality. Every office worker has a particular type of desk they keep. And a number of studies suggest that the state of your desk might affect how you work, from the idea that disorderly environments produce creativity — to the idea that too much mess can interfere with focus. Deliberately or not, we’re constantly making statements about ourselves through our personal presentation of the desk. One of the reasons physical spaces, including our office desks, can be so revealing about us is that they’re essentially the crystallization of a lot of behavior over time.",
		"Numbers were invented to describe precise amounts: three teeth, seven days, twelve goats. When quantities are large, however, we do not use numbers in a precise way. We approximate using a ‘round number’ as a place mark. It is easier and more convenient. When we say, for example, that there were a hundred people at the market, we don’t mean that there were exactly one hundred people there. And when we say that the universe is 13.7 billion years old, we don’t mean exactly 13,700,000,000; we mean give or take a few hundred million years. Big numbers are understood approximately, small ones precisely, and these two systems interact uneasily. It is clear nonsense to say that next year the universe will be ‘13.7 billion and one’ years old. It will remain 13.7 billion years old for the rest of our lives.",
		"In 1947, when the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered, archaeologists set a finder’s fee for each new document. Instead of lots of extra scrolls being found, they were simply torn apart to increase the reward. Similarly, in China in the nineteenth century, an incentive was offered for finding dinosaur bones. Farmers located a few on their land, broke them into pieces, and made a lot of money. Modern incentives are no better: Company boards promise bonuses for achieved targets. And what happens? Managers invest more energy in trying to lower the targets than in growing the business. People respond to incentives by doing what is in their best interests. What is noteworthy is, first, how quickly and radically people’s behavior changes when incentives come into play, and second, the fact that people respond to the incentives themselves, and not the higher intentions behind them.",
		"Katherine Schreiber and Leslie Sim, experts on exercise addiction, recognized that smartwatches and fitness trackers have probably inspired sedentary people to take up exercise, and encouraged people who arent very active to exercise more consistently. But they were convinced the devices were also quite dangerous. Schreiber explained that focusing on numbers separates people from being in tune with their body. Exercising becomes mindless, which is the goal of addiction. This goal that she mentioned is a sort of automatic mindlessness, the outsourcing of decision making to a device. She recently sustained a stress fracture in her foot because she refused to listen to her overworked body, instead continuing to run toward an unreasonable workout target. Schreiber has suffered from addictive exercise tendencies, and vows not to use wearable tech when she works out.",
		"Your sense of smell links you directly with your feelings, instincts and memories. Scents have the power to stimulate states of well-being. By utilizing aromas in your daily habits, you can enjoy the advantages of an intense state of health. Find a scent that you like and inhale its perfume at times when youre feeling calmed and at peace. Perhaps its the incense that you burn during meditation, a torch that you light during a calming bath, or an aromatic oil spray that you put on your cushion before bedtime. In time, your body will connect these relaxed feelings with the usage of that specific scent. When you encounter a moment of stress, you can smell the aroma that you connect with a state of relax and that will produce a calming response throughout your whole body.",
		"Each spring in North America, the early morning hours are filled with the sweet sounds of songbirds, such as sparrows and robins. While it may seem like these birds are simply singing songs, many are in the middle of an intense competition for territories. For many birds, this struggle could ultimately decide whom they mate with and if they ever raise a family. When the birds return from their winter feeding grounds, the males usually arrive first. Older, more dominant males will reclaim their old territories: a tree, shrub, or even a window ledge. Younger males will try to challenge the older ones for space by mimicking the song that the older males are singing. The birds that can sing the loudest and the longest usually wind up with the best territories.",
		"Why do you go to the library? For books, yes—and you like books because they tell stories. You hope to get lost in a story or be transported into someone else’s life. At one type of library, you can do just that—even though there’s not a single book. At a Human Library, people with unique life stories volunteer to be the “books.” For a certain amount of time, you can ask them questions and listen to their stories, which are as fascinating and inspiring as any you can find in a book. Many of the stories have to do with some kind of stereotype. You can speak with a refugee, a soldier suffering from PTSD, and a homeless person. The Human Library encourages people to challenge their own existing notions—to truly get to know, and learn from, someone they might otherwise make quick judgements about.",
		" We create a picture of the world using the examples that most easily come to mind. This is foolish, of course, because in reality, things don’t happen more frequently just because we can imagine them more easily. Thanks to this prejudice, we travel through life with an incorrect risk map in our heads. Thus, we overestimate the risk of being the victims of a plane crash, a car accident, or a murder. And we underestimate the risk of dying from less spectacular means, such as diabetes or stomach cancer. The chances of bomb attacks are much rarer than we think, and the chances of suffering depression are much higher. We attach too much likelihood to spectacular, flashy, or loud outcomes. Anything silent or invisible we downgrade in our minds. Our brains imagine impressive outcomes more readily than ordinary ones.",
		"Many parents do not understand why their teenagers occasionally behave in an irrational or dangerous way. At times, it seems like teens don’t think things through or fully consider the consequences of their actions. Adolescents differ from adults in the way they behave, solve problems, and make decisions. There is a biological explanation for this difference. Studies have shown that brains continue to mature and develop throughout adolescence and well into early adulthood. Scientists have identified a specific region of the brain that is responsible for immediate reactions including fear and aggressive behavior. This region develops early. However, the frontal cortex, the area of the brain that controls reasoning and helps us think before we act, develops later. This part of the brain is still changing and maturing well into adulthood.",
		"Do you have a tendency to focus more on what you don’t have than on what you do? Unfortunately, many people tend to focus on what they don’t have, when in reality they are sitting on a pile of blessings! Unrealistic expectations and comparisons to others lead to jealousy. Being envious of what others have only serves to make you unhappy with what you personally have. It’s hard to be grateful when all you can think about is what you don’t have or think you should get. Oftentimes frustration and dissatisfaction are actually the result of unrealistic expectations on our part. We think our situation should be this way or that way, or at least different from the way it is. Gratitude is not about expectations, but about being thankful for our situation no matter what our expectations may be.",
		"In the 1930s the work of Sigmund Freud, the ‘father of psychoanalysis’, began to be widely known and appreciated. Less well known at the time was the fact that Freud had found out, almost by accident, how helpful his pet dog Jofi was to his patients. He had only become a dog­lover in later life when Jofi was given to him by his daughter Anna. The dog sat in on the doctor’s therapy sessions and Freud discovered that his patients felt much more comfortable talking about their problems if the dog was there. Some of them even preferred to talk to Jofi, rather than the doctor! Freud noted that if the dog sat near the patient, the patient found it easier to relax, but if Jofi sat on the other side of the room, the patient seemed more tense and distressed. He was surprised to realize that Jofi seemed to sense this too. The dog’s presence was an especially calming influence on child and teenage patients.",
		"Take the choice of which kind of soup to buy. There’s too much data here for you to struggle with: calories, price, salt content, taste, packaging, and so on. If you were a robot, you’d be stuck here all day trying to make a decision, with no obvious way to trade off which details matter more. To land on a choice, you need a summary of some sort. And that’s what the feedback from your body is able to give you. Thinking about your budget might make your palms sweat, or your mouth might water thinking about the last time you consumed the chicken noodle soup, or noting the excessive creaminess of the other soup might give you a stomachache. You simulate your experience with one soup, and then the other. Your bodily experience helps your brain to quickly place a value on soup A, and another on soup B, allowing you to tip the balance in one direction or the other. You don’t just extract the data from the soup cans, you feel the data.",
		"The earliest challenges and contests to solve important problems in mathematics date back to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Some of these problems have continued to challenge mathematicians until modern times. For example, Pierre de Fermat issued a set of mathematical challenges in 1657, many on prime numbers and divisibility. The solution to what is now known as Fermat’s Last Theorem was not established until the late 1990s by Andrew Wiles. David Hilbert, a German mathematician, identified 23 unsolved problems in 1900 with the hope that these problems would be solved in the twenty­first century. Although some of the problems were solved, others remain unsolved to this day. More recently, in 2000, the Clay Mathematics Institute named seven mathematical problems that had not been solved with the hope that they could be solved in the twenty­first century. A $1 million prize will be awarded for solving each of these seven problems.",
		"There has been a general belief that sport is a way of reducing violence. Anthropologist Richard Sipes tests this notion in a classic study of the relationship between sport and violence. Focusing on what he calls “combative sports,” those sports including actual body contact between opponents or simulated warfare, he hypothesizes that if sport is an alternative to violence, then one would expect to find an inverse correlation between the popularity of combative sports and the frequency and intensity of warfare. In other words, the more combative sports (e.g., football, boxing) the less likely warfare. Using the Human Relations Area Files and a sample of 20 societies, Sipes tests the hypothesis and discovers a significant relationship between combative sports and violence, but a direct one, not the inverse correlation of his hypothesis. According to Sipes’ analysis, the more pervasive and popular combative sports are in a society, the more likely that society is to engage in war. So, Sipes draws the obvious conclusion that combative sports are not alternatives to war but rather are reflections of the same aggressive impulses in human society.",
		"If a food contains more sugar than any other ingredient, government regulations require that sugar be listed first on the label. But if a food contains several different kinds of sweeteners, they can be listed separately, which pushes each one farther down the list. This requirement has led the food industry to put in three different sources of sugar so that they don’t have to say the food has that much sugar. So sugar doesn’t appear first. Whatever the true motive, ingredient labeling still does not fully convey the amount of sugar being added to food, certainly not in a language that’s easy for consumers to understand. A world­famous cereal brand’s label, for example, indicates that the cereal has 11 grams of sugar per serving. But nowhere does it tell consumers that more than one­third of the box contains added sugar.",
		"Many inventions were invented thousands of years ago so it can be difficult to know their exact origins. Sometimes scientists discover a model of an early invention and from this model they can accurately tell us how old it is and where it came from. However, there is always the possibility that in the future other scientists will discover an even older model of the same invention in a different part of the world. In fact, we are forever discovering the history of ancient inventions. An example of this is the invention of pottery. For many years archaeologists believed that pottery was first invented in the Near East (around modern Iran) where they had found pots dating back to 9,000 B.C. In the 1960s, however, older pots from 10,000 B.C. were found on Honshu Island, Japan. There is always a possibility that in the future archaeologists will find even older pots somewhere else.",
		"Since the early 1980s, Black Friday has been a kind of unofficial U.S. holiday marking the beginning of the holiday season and, consequently, the most profitable time for retailers in the year. But in recent years, a new movement has come to light, adding a more ecological philosophy. The movement is called Green Friday, and it seeks to raise awareness about the damage that Black Friday brings to the environment. Think of the carbon emissions caused by driving to the mall, the shipping of millions of items around the world, the plastic waste produced by packaging, and even the long­term waste produced by mindlessly buying things we don’t need. Green Friday is about changing the way we see this day and switching our mindset from “buy, buy, buy” to finding alternative ways to give gifts during the holiday season so we don’t cause further damage to the Earth. Even if only a small percentage of the population makes the switch, it’ll mean great things for the environment.",
		"In government, in law, in culture, and in routine everyday interaction beyond family and immediate neighbours, a widely understood and clearly formulated language is a great aid to mutual confidence. When dealing with property, with contracts, or even just with the routine exchange of goods and services, concepts and descriptions need to be as precise and unambiguous as possible, otherwise misunderstandings will arise. If full communication with a potential counterparty in a deal is not possible, then uncertainty and probably a measure of distrust will remain. As economic life became more complex in the later Middle Ages, the need for fuller and more precise communication was accentuated. A shared language facilitated clarification and possibly settlement of any disputes. In international trade also the use of a precise and well-formulated language aided the process of translation. The Silk Road could only function at all because translators were always available at interchange points.",
		"Some beginning researchers mistakenly believe that a good hypothesis is one that is guaranteed to be right (e.g., alcohol will slow down reaction time). However, if we already know your hypothesis is true before you test it, testing your hypothesis won’t tell us anything new. Remember, research is supposed to produce new knowledge. To get new knowledge, you, as a researcher­explorer, need to leave the safety of the shore (established facts) and venture into uncharted waters (as Einstein said, “If we knew what we were doing, it would not be called research, would it?”). If your predictions about what will happen in these uncharted waters are wrong, that’s okay: Scientists are allowed to make mistakes (as Bates said, “Research is the process of going up alleys to see if they are blind”). Indeed, scientists often learn more from predictions that do not turn out than from those that do.",
		"News reporters are taught to start their stories with the most important information. The first sentence, called the lead, contains the most essential elements of the story. A good lead can convey a lot of information. After the lead, information is presented in decreasing order of importance. Journalists call this the “inverted pyramid” structure—the most important information (the widest part of the pyramid) is at the top. The inverted pyramid is great for readers. No matter what the reader’s attention span—whether she reads only the lead or the entire story—the inverted pyramid maximizes the information she gets. Think of the alternative: If news stories were written like mysteries with a dramatic payoff at the end, then readers who broke off in mid‑story would miss the point. Imagine waiting until the last sentence of a story to find out who won the presidential election or the Super Bowl.",
		"Before the fancy high­rises, financial headquarters, tourist centers, and souvenir peddlers made their way to Battery Park City, the area behind the World Trade Center was a giant, gross landfill. In 1982, artist Agnes Denes decided to return that landfill back to its roots, although temporarily. Denes was commissioned by the Public Art Fund to create one of the most significant and fantastical pieces of public work Manhattan has ever seen. Her concept was not a traditional sculpture, but a living installation that changed the way the public looked at art. In the name of art, Denes put a beautiful golden wheat field right in the shadow of the gleaming Twin Towers. For Wheatfield—A Confrontation, Denes and volunteers removed trash from four acres of land, then planted amber waves of grain atop the area. After months of farming and irrigation, the wheat field was thriving and ready. The artist and her volunteers harvested thousands of pounds of wheat to give to food banks in the city, nourishing both the minds and bodies of New Yorkers.",
		"The free market has liberated people in a way that Marxism never could. What is more, as A. O. Hirschman, the Harvard economic historian, showed in his classic study The Passions and the Interests, the market was seen by Enlightenment thinkers Adam Smith, David Hume, and Montesquieu as a powerful solution to one of humanity’s greatest traditional weaknesses: violence. When two nations meet, said Montesquieu, they can do one of two things: they can wage war or they can trade. If they wage war, both are likely to lose in the long run. If they trade, both will gain. That, of course, was the logic behind the establishment of the European Union: to lock together the destinies of its nations, especially France and Germany, in such a way that they would have an overwhelming interest not to wage war again as they had done to such devastating cost in the first half of the twentieth century.",
		"The realization of human domination over the environment began in the late 1700s with the industrial revolution. Advances in manufacturing transformed societies and economies while producing significant impacts on the environment. American society became structured on multiple industries’ capitalistic goals as the development of the steam engine led to the mechanized production of goods in mass quantities. Rural agricultural communities with economies based on handmade goods and agriculture were abandoned for life in urban cities with large factories based on an economy of industrialized manufacturing. Innovations in the production of textiles, iron, and steel provided increased profits to private companies. Simultaneously, those industries exerted authority over the environment and began dumping hazardous by­products in public lands and waterways.",
		"A building is an inanimate object, but it is not an inarticulate one. Even the simplest house always makes a statement, one expressed in brick and stone, in wood and glass, rather than in words—but no less loud and obvious. When we see a rusting trailer surrounded by weeds and abandoned cars, or a brand­new mini­mansion with a high wall, we instantly get a message. In both of these cases, though in different accents, it is “Stay Out of Here.” It is not only houses, of course, that communicate with us. All kinds of buildings—churches, museums, schools, hospitals, restaurants, and offices—speak to us silently. Sometimes the statement is deliberate. A store or restaurant can be designed so that it welcomes mostly low­income or high­income customers. Buildings tell us what to think and how to act, though we may not register their messages consciously.",
		"From the earliest times, healthcare services have been recognized to have two equal aspects, namely clinical care and public healthcare. In classical Greek mythology, the god of medicine, Asklepios, had two daughters, Hygiea and Panacea. The former was the goddess of preventive health and wellness, or hygiene, and the latter the goddess of treatment and curing. In modern times, the societal ascendancy of medical professionalism has caused treatment of sick patients to overshadow those preventive healthcare services provided by the less heroic figures of sanitary engineers, biologists, and governmental public health officers. Nevertheless, the quality of health that human populations enjoy is attributable less to surgical dexterity, innovative pharmaceutical products, and bioengineered devices than to the availability of public sanitation, sewage management, and services which control the pollution of the air, drinking water, urban noise, and food for human consumption. The human right to the highest attainable standard of health depends on public healthcare services no less than on the skills and equipment of doctors and hospitals.",
		"The recent “cycling as a lifestyle” craze has expressed itself in an increase in the number of active cyclists and in growth of cycling club membership in several European, American, Australian and Asian urban areas. It has also been accompanied by a symbolic reinterpretation of the bicycle. After the bicycle had been associated with poverty for many years, expensive recreational bicycles or recreationally-inspired commuting bicycles have suddenly become aspirational products in urban environments. In present times, cycling has become an activity which is also performed for its demonstrative value, its role in identity construction and its effectiveness in impressing others and signaling social status. To a certain extent, cycling has turned into a symbolic marker of the well-off. Obviously, value-laden consumption behavior is by no means limited to cycling. However, the link with identity construction and conspicuous consumption has become particularly manifest in the case of cycling.",
		"Winning turns on a self‑conscious awareness that others are watching. It’s a lot easier to move under the radar when no one knows you and no one is paying attention. You can mess up and be rough and get dirty because no one even knows you’re there. But as soon as you start to win, and others start to notice, you’re suddenly aware that you’re being observed. You’re being judged. You worry that others will discover your flaws and weaknesses, and you start hiding your true personality, so you can be a good role model and good citizen and a leader that others can respect. There is nothing wrong with that. But if you do it at the expense of being who you really are, making decisions that please others instead of pleasing yourself, you’re not going to be in that position very long. When you start apologizing for who you are, you stop growing and you stop winning. Permanently.",
		"New words and expressions emerge continually in response to new situations, ideas and feelings. The Oxford English Dictionary publishes supplements of new words and expressions that have entered the language. Some people deplore this kind of thing and see it as a drift from correct English. But it was only in the eighteenth century that any attempt was made to formalize spelling and punctuation of English at all. The language we speak in the twenty­first century would be virtually unintelligible to Shakespeare, and so would his way of speaking to us. Alvin Toffler estimated that Shakespeare would probably only understand about 250,000 of the 450,000 words in general use in the English language now. In other words, so to speak, if Shakespeare were to materialize in London today he would understand, on average, only five out of every nine words in our vocabulary.",
		"As you may already know, what and how you buy can be political. To whom do you want to give your money? Which companies and corporations do you value and respect? Be mindful about every purchase by carefully researching the corporations that are taking our money to decide if they deserve our support. Do they have a record of polluting the environment, or do they have fair­trade practices and an end­of­life plan for the products they make? Are they committed to bringing about good in the world? For instance, my family has found a company producing recycled, plastic­packaging­free toilet paper with a social conscience. They contribute 50 percent of their profits to the construction of toilets around the world, and we’re genuinely happy to spend our money on this special toilet paper each month. Remember that the corporate world is built on consumers, so as a consumer you have the power to vote with your wallet and encourage companies to embrace healthier and more sustainable practices with every purchase you choose to make.",
		"In response to human-like care robots, critics might charge that human-robot interactions create moral hazards for dementia patients. Even if deception is sometimes allowed when it serves worthy goals, should it be allowed for vulnerable users? Just as children on the autism spectrum with robot companions might be easily fooled into thinking of robots as friends, older adults with cognitive deficits might be. According to Alexis Elder, a professor at UMD, robots are false friends, inferior to true friendship. Reasoning along similar lines, John Sullins, a professor at Sonoma State University, holds that robots should “remain iconic or cartoonish so that they are easily distinguished as synthetic even by unsophisticated users.” At least then no one is fooled. Making robots clearly fake also avoids the so-called “uncanny valley,” where robots are perceived as scary because they so closely resemble us, but not quite. Other critics of robot deception argue that when care recipients are deceived into thinking that robots care, this crosses a line and violates human dignity.",
		"The most prevalent problem kids report is that they feel like they need to be accessible at all times. Because technology allows for it, they feel an obligation. It’s easy for most of us to relate—you probably feel the same pressure in your own life! It is really challenging to deal with the fact that we’re human and can’t always respond instantly. For a teen or tween who’s still learning the ins and outs of social interactions, it’s even worse. Here’s how this behavior plays out sometimes: Your child texts one of his friends, and the friend doesn’t text back right away. Now it’s easy for your child to think, “This person doesn’t want to be my friend anymore!” So he texts again, and again, and again— “blowing up their phone.” This can be stress­inducing and even read as aggressive. But you can see how easily this could happen.",
		"Most people get trapped in their optimistic biases, so they tend to listen to positive feedback and ignore negative feedback. Although this may help them come across as confident to others, in any area of competence (e.g., education, business, sports or performing arts) achievement is 10% performance and 90% preparation. Thus, the more aware you are of your weaknesses, the better prepared you will be. Low self-confidence may turn you into a pessimist, but when pessimism teams up with ambition it often produces outstanding performance. To be the very best at anything, you will need to be your harshest critic, and that is almost impossible when your starting point is high self-confidence. Exceptional achievers always experience low levels of confidence and self-confidence, but they train hard and practice continually until they reach an acceptable level of competence.",
		"When we experience life’s setbacks and feel down, something strange happens. In a kind of relationship reflex, our bodies automatically begin to send signals to attract loving care from another person. Our eyelids droop, our gazes turn downward, our shoulders drop, and our faces seem to say, “Doesn’t anyone see how sad I am? Doesn’t anyone want to help me?” Conversely, something within us causes us to be attracted to those who seem in distress and who are flashing their depression displays. We may respond by saying, “Are you okay?” or “You look like you’re carrying the burdens of the world on your back,” or “You look like you could use a shoulder to lean on.” When we are wilted and drooping, our sadness signals are received by others who are strangely attracted by our messages.",
		"For many years now, mediated entertainment such as TV and film has been able to stimulate our optical and auditory senses with sights and sounds. Some forms of new media, however, even engage our senses of touch and smell. The view the wearer of some special device sees is projected on the screen behind him. Wearers become immersed in the computerized scene and use the gloves to pick up and move simulated objects. Many virtual reality games and rides now allow audiences and players to feel sensations of motion and touch. New media may also include aromas, such as Disney’s “Soaring Over California” attraction at the California Adventure theme park, where audiences smell orange orchards and pine forests while enjoying a simulated hang-gliding experience across the countryside. Makers of emerging forms of entertainment will likely continue to experiment with ways they can simulate and manipulate reality by stimulating our senses.",
		"It’s no coincidence that some people are just like their dogs. Researchers in Bath, England, conducted an online survey of 1,000 dog owners and found that certain human personality traits link to specific canines. The research claims that if you own a German Shepherd, you’re most likely outgoing. Got a Golden Retriever? Odds are you’re conscientious. A Chihuahua? Research says you’re agreeable. “It seems likely that personality types are subconsciously drawn to certain breeds,” reported study author Lance Workman in a British Psychological Society news release. The study indicates that you may be able to predict someone’s personality based on his or her dog of choice. Of course, lifestyle plays a part too. For example, according to Workman, more active individuals are better suited to athletic, pastoral breeds such as Border Collies, while those who are considered emotionally stable might be suited to hound dogs such as Beagles or Greyhounds.",
		"Traditional consumption was not particularly thrifty. The concept of thrift emerged out of a more affluent money culture. In traditional societies where resources continued to be scarce, consumption was more seasonally and communally orientated. In years of bountiful crops people ate heartily, and in lean years they starved. People were not particularly motivated to produce more goods for stockpiling, as there was little incentive to do so where there was little security from raids. When times were good, celebrations of gluttony were held in the winter season when stocks could not be refilled. These rituals were more important than the potential hardships such celebrations might later bring, as they served to bind people together and distribute resources. Holiday rituals were typically structured around cultural practices such as song, dance, theater, and feasting, and took a great deal of time away from work.",
		"In one study, fourteen­month­olds watched an adult experimenter bend over and activate a light by pressing the button with her head. For some of the infants, the adult’s hands were bound by a blanket. The babies were then given the light switch to play with. Infants who saw the adult whose arms were bound activated the light switch with their hand because they understood that the adult was unable to use their hands. However, if they were the ones who saw that the adult’s hands were free, then the infants bent over and activated the button with their head, too. They must have reasoned that it was important to use the head and not the hands. Infants were not simply copying the actions but rather repeating the intended goal.",
		"The body is like a symphony where thousands of metabolic actions are orchestrated into harmony through the constant fine­tuning of conscious (e.g. exercise) and subconscious (e.g. digestion) instructions. When the harmony is broken, the body sends us information, signals and symptoms, in very direct and obvious ways. It is necessary that we pay attention to these signals instead of viewing them as burdens in our life. If we ignore or suppress health symptoms, they will become progressively louder and more extreme as the body attempts to capture our attention. When the oil light comes on in our car, do we disconnect the light, or do we take the car in for service? We usually take our car to the shop at the first sign of trouble. However, when it comes to our health, how many of us wait until the situation becomes serious before taking action?",
		"A woman in one of my seminars found that by going to bed early she could get up at four o’clock in the morning. She could then do the equivalent of a full day’s work by seven or eight o’clock, before the average person even got started. In no time at all, she was producing and earning double the amount of her co­workers. She was continually promoted and paid more money because she was getting far more done than anyone else. Successful people make a habit of getting up early, usually by 6:00 or 6:30 in the morning, sometimes earlier, and then getting going immediately. This gives them a great jump on the day. The average person, on the other hand, takes a full hour to get up and get going in the morning. Then they drag themselves off to work, thinking about lunchtime, and what they are going to do in the evening.",
		"Whether or not we can catch up on sleep―on the weekend, say―is a hotly debated topic among sleep researchers; the latest evidence suggests that while it isn’t ideal, it might help. When Peter Liu, a UCLA sleep researcher, brought chronically sleep-restricted people into the lab for a weekend of sleep during which they slept about 10 hours per night, they showed improvements in the ability of insulin to process blood sugar. That suggests that catch-up sleep may undo some but not all of the damage that sleep deprivation causes, which is encouraging given how many adults don’t get the hours they need each night. Still, Liu isn’t ready to endorse the habit of sleeping less and making up for it later. “It’s like telling people you only need to eat healthy during the weekends, but during the week you can eat whatever you like,” he says.",
		"Although the Internet seems truly global these days, less than half of the world’s population has access to it. Some four billion people are still unconnected. This spring, IT engineers will begin to shift to the next phase in a grand plan to bring the Internet to everyone. Their goal is to establish a network of high-altitude balloons that will rain 4G LTE signals down to anyone with a 4G device. Regional telecom companies will transmit the signals to the balloons, and then each balloon will relay the signals to a ground area many miles in diameter. In this way, farmers in remote areas will be able to access weather data, and rural children will be able to pursue online educations. By the end of the year, the engineers aim to have 100 balloons about 13 miles up.",
		"Inflation can be a major life concern for most people. It makes it difficult for households to plan ahead. This is because ‘future problems’ concerning inflation often make us change our plans for the future. For instance, how much should the parents of a newborn start regularly saving to pay for her college education? If inflation averages two percent, prices roughly double every thirty-six years. But if inflation gets up to eight percent, prices roughly double every nine years. A Harvard education that currently costs $100,000 may therefore end up costing half a million dollars for an infant born today. Millions of workers who retired with pensions during the 1960s and 1970s found that inflation pushed up costs far beyond their expected expenses. Many had to reenter the workforce just to make ends meet.",
		"We have seen that individuals in many species are more likely to behave in an altruistic way when close relatives or kin will benefit than when only non‒relatives will gain. This suggests that they can recognize which members of their species are kin and which are not. How does this occur? A key point is that individuals are by no means always accurate on this issue. For example, there are several species of birds in which the parents will ignore their own offspring if they are put outside their nest. However, if a cuckoo or other bird deposits an egg inside their nest, they will look after the bird when it hatches as if it were their own. These observations suggest that individuals tend to regard any other animal living in their home as kin even if there is no close physical resemblance.",
		" Maximilian Ringelmann, a French engineer, studied the performance of horses in 1913. He concluded that the power of two animals pulling a coach did not equal twice the power of a single horse. Surprised by this result, he extended his research to humans. He had several men pull a rope and measured the force applied by each individual. On average, if two people were pulling together, each invested just 93 percent of his individual strength, when three pulled together, it was 85 percent, and with eight people, just 49 percent. Science calls this the social loafing effect. It occurs when individual performance is not directly visible; it blends into the group effort. It occurs among rowers, but not in relay races, because here, individual contributions are evident. Social loafing is rational behavior: Why invest all of your energy when half will do─especially when this little shortcut goes unnoticed? Quite simply, social loafing is a form of cheating of which we are all guilty even if it takes place unconsciously, just as it does with the horses.",
		"Effective coaches prioritize. They focus on a single task instead of trying to multitask. They understand that multitasking is another way of saying you are going to complete several tasks, none of which are going to be very good. Yuhong Jiang, professor of psychology at Harvard University, points out that the brain isn’t built to concentrate on two things at once. It works more slowly if it tries to. Effective coaches focus on those things that need to get done and separate out everything else. Separating what’s important from what’s not important is prioritizing. Ineffective coaches fail to put the big tasks first. They either believe they have unlimited time, thinking that they will have more time tomorrow to get something done, or they underestimate how much time they really do have. They have no ability to estimate how long a task will take.",
		"When we lived as foragers with earthbound religions, animals were the first beings, world­shapers, and the teachers and ancestors of people. When we became agriculturalists and looked to the heavens for instruction about the seasons and bad weather, we saw animal forms among the stars. Of the forty­eight Ptolemaic constellations, all but a few are organic, and twenty­five are named for animals. Of the twenty­two more that were added in the 17th century, nineteen have animal names. When people built huge earthworks to appeal to the powers of heavens, they built them in animal forms. Some in Peru are over a mile long. One in Ohio is in the shape of a giant snake with an egg in its mouth.",
		"Bargain hunting represents one of the significant reasons why people shop. It’s all about the excitement of finding merchandise at surprisingly low prices and being able to take advantage of such discounts. The thrill of bargain hunting motivates shoppers and gives them a feeling of winning over the retailers. It’s an important part of the shopping mentality and one that retailers could probably take better advantage of. How many retailers set out with the explicit goal of literally raising the adrenaline levels of their shoppers by offering prices that are truly unbelievable or exciting? This is surely one way to spur sales and increase the interest of shoppers. Everyday sale prices are not the same―the bargain must truly stand out in the consumer’s mind as a good deal that is just too exceptional to pass up.",
		"There’s no subject you don’t have permission to write about. Students often avoid subjects close to their heart― skateboarding, cheerleading, rock music, cars―because they assume that their teachers will regard these topics as ‘stupid.’ No area of life is stupid to someone who takes it seriously. If you follow your affections, you will write well and will engage your readers. I’ve read elegant books on fishing, mountain climbing, giant sea turtles and many other subjects I didn’t think I was interested in. Write about your hobbies: cooking, gardening, photography, knitting, jogging, sailing, scuba diving. Write about your work: teaching, nursing, running a store. Write about a field you enjoyed in college and always meant to get back to: history, biography, art, archeology. No subject is too specialized if you make an honest connection with it when you write about it.",
		"Becoming indispensable can be as much about how you work as what you produce. Many employees believe they will receive the recognition they desire by attacking their work with a singular vision. They are driven with laser-beam focus, believing this will help them create optimal results that will showcase their talents and impress those at the top. But when you do this, something important is missing. A narrow focus tends to produce narrow results only valuable to your little corner of the company. The most successful employees are not those who focus solely on their own work. They are those who maintain a broader focus, keeping their tasks in line with what’s most important to the company and its future. Producing through the lens of the bigger picture will make your work seem larger than life, while work produced with a narrow focus is usually dismissed as “typical.”",
		"Savannas pose a bit of a problem for ecologists. There is an axiom in ecology that ‘complete competitors cannot coexist’: in other words, where two populations of organisms use exactly the same resources, one would be expected to do so slightly more efficiently than the other and therefore come to dominate in the long term. In temperate parts of the world, either trees dominate (in forests) or grasses dominate (in grasslands). Yet, in savannas grasses and trees coexist. The classic explanation proposes that trees have deep roots while grasses have shallow roots. The two plant types are therefore able to coexist because they are not in fact competitors: the trees increase in wetter climates and on sandier soils because more water is able to penetrate to the deep roots. Trees do indeed have a few small roots which penetrate to great depth, but most of their roots are in the top half-metre of the soil, just where the grass roots are.",
		"Something extraordinary from a cognitive perspective happens when a group starts to sing together. On your own, you might get stuck after the first line of the song. Singing with a single friend, your companion might remember the first word of the second line and that keeps you going for another few words, but then neither of you can remember the third line just now. In a large group, no one has to be able to recollect the entire song. Just one person singing the first syllable of a word can trigger a recollection in another group member to bring the second syllable of that same word, which in turn can cue a group of people to that whole word and the next three words after it. Imagine this notion propagated through a large group of dozens or hundreds of people, and throughout every syllable of the song―a sort of group consciousness emerges in which no single member of the group can be said to know the song, but the group itself does.",
		"A strategic vision has little value to the organization unless it’s effectively communicated down the line to lower-level managers and employees. It would be difficult for a vision statement to provide direction to decision makers and energize employees toward achieving long-term strategic intent unless they know of the vision and observe management’s commitment to that vision. Communicating the vision to organization members nearly always means putting “where we are going and why” in writing, distributing the statement organizationwide, and having executives personally explain the vision and its justification to as many people as possible. Ideally, executives should present their vision for the company in a manner that reaches out and grabs people’s attention. An engaging and convincing strategic vision has enormous motivational value― for the same reason that a stone mason is inspired by building a great cathedral for the ages.",
		"If you ever tried to cut wood with a blunt, dull axe, you know how much effort it takes to succeed. But as soon as the blade is filed sharp, the work can proceed with much less exertion. The secret lies in knowing when to stop and sharpen the blade. The same principles hold true for work. If you are stuck in a pattern of doing the same things every day and you feel as though you are becoming dull, perhaps it is time to stop and sharpen your axe. Sign up for a business seminar, read business books or magazines or attend a trade show. Take decisive action to restore a sharp edge to your productivity. This is the very reason professionals such as accountants, lawyers and nurses are required to continuously learn what’s new in the profession in order to remain up­to­date and useful in their professions. Stay motivated and accept no excuses for not increasing your efficiency and effectiveness.",
		"It has been estimated that every $1.00 spent on locally produced foods returns (or circulates) $3.00 to $7.00 within the community. Consumers buy produce and other goods from local farmers, who buy farm supplies from local businesses. Those businesses help to keep people in the community employed, and, in turn, they spend their money back in the community. This helps to encourage a thriving community and increases the economic health of the region. In addition, when farmers have direct access to consumers, they are able to keep more of each dollar earned from a sale, because the middle­man is eliminated. This increases profits to producers and keeps their farms competitive with the traditional retail chain stores. Purchasing local produce not only improves the local economy, but it can also help you stretch your food dollar and get high­quality fruits and vegetables.",
		"Chalk and blackboards first made their mark in higher education at elite military schools at the start of the 19th century. Decades of war and geopolitical turmoil, combined with sweeping changes to the scale and social organization of governments, put a new premium on training large groups of elite civil and military engineers. Mathematics was their essential tool, and would also become a gateway subject for efficiently sorting the best and brightest. Blackboards offered instructors a way of working quickly and visibly in front of the large groups of elite students who would now need to know mathematics to a greater degree than ever before. They also provided a setting for discipline, allowing those instructors to examine and correct the work of many students at once or in succession as they solved problems at the board.",
		"The words you speak to someone may have the potential to make or break that person, so it is important to choose words carefully. When it comes to benefitting the talk you intend to have with others, this becomes even more important. If you are someone who just says whatever crosses your mind without thinking about how those words might be taken by others, then you are setting yourself up for failure as a small talker. Most people keep away from people they consider too blunt and some will be even brave enough to leave your company if you are insensitive. Careful choice of words means that you would have thought about what you are going to say beforehand. Besides helping you keep the small talk going, thinking before speaking also helps prevent you from saying some embarrassing things you may end up wishing you could swallow.",
		"If you’ve ever seen the bank of flashing screens at a broker’s desk, you have a sense of the information overload they are up against. When deciding whether to invest in a company, for example, they may take into account the people at the helm; the current and potential size of its market; net profits; and its past, present, and future stock value, among other pieces of information. Weighing all of these factors can take up so much of your working memory that it becomes overwhelmed. Think of having piles and piles of papers, sticky notes, and spreadsheets strewn about your desk, and you get a picture of what’s going on inside the brain. When information overloads working memory this way, it can make brokers―and the rest of us―scrap all the strategizing and analyses and go for emotional, or gut, decisions.",
		"We humans share our understanding of “what is out there” in the world, but we are not entirely born into it. We all begin in a kind of sensory chaos―what William James called an “aboriginal sensible muchness”: a more or less undifferentiated mass of sounds and lights, colors and textures and smells. When we are growing up, we learn to bring attention to certain elements and to ignore others. By adulthood, we all agree on what is “out there.” But let’s focus on what we ignore: so much! The patterns of pebbles in asphalt, the pitch of a radiator’s hiss, our own heart beating tangibly in our fingertips and temples. The infant has a mind unrestricted by experience: he has no expectations, so he is not closed off from experiencing something anew.",
		"One of the common problems of sensitive people is an excess of delta brainwaves. If you are one of these people, you might appear overly sensitive to the thoughts, feelings, and needs of other people. Your unconscious mind is picking up too many stimuli from the outside world and absorbing them inappropriately. What do you do with these stimuli? A common response is to assume that other people’s painful emotions are your own, with very little differentiation between what is yours and what is not yours. Or, because you are more aware of other people’s discomforts, you might feel a need to take responsibility for them―to fix them. Sometimes this desire to fix them is simply an urge to alleviate the pain that you are feeling yourself as a result of being too interconnected with others’ emotions. Sometimes it is a more complex psychological game: because you can feel it so strongly, you must somehow have caused it. Therefore you feel guilty unless you do something about it.",
		"When consumers lack adequate information to make informed choices, governments frequently step in to require that firms provide information. In the United States, we are all familiar with the mandatory nutritional information placed on food products. The Securities and Exchange Commission that monitors American stock markets forces firms to meet certain reporting requirements before their stock can be listed on exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange. Such reporting helps ensure that private investors have reliable information on which to base their investment decisions. Often, however, these regulations do not work adequately, as the Enron scandal in 2001 clearly illustrates. The oil trading company Enron had cooked its books to overstate its profitability in its mandated reports. One outcome of Enron’s subsequent financial collapse was the introduction of new regulations designed to improve the reliability of the information that companies must provide to the public.",
		"Appealing though it might be to offload the responsibility for teaching our students basic knowledge to their elementary school teachers or to the Internet, the research of cognitive psychologists who study learning and the basic study habits of most students suggest that we cannot do this. One of our first and most important tasks as teachers is to help students develop a rich body of knowledge in our content areas—without doing so, we handicap considerably their ability to engage in cognitive activities like thinking and evaluating and creating. As cognitive psychologist Daniel Willingham argued, you can’t think creatively about information unless you have information in your head to think about. “Research from cognitive science has shown,” he explained, “that the sorts of skills that teachers want for their students—such as the ability to analyze and think critically—require extensive factual knowledge.” We have to know things, in other words, to think critically about them.",
		"With the general accessibility of photocopiers in student libraries, students tend to copy the relevant material for later use. In such cases the students are not always selective about what they copy. Often useless material is gathered that may seem important at the time but does not seem so in their study room on the night before an exam or essay due date. In addition, when most people photocopy material from books, they feel as if they have actually accomplished something. After all, a few photocopied pages in their notebook now represent information that used to be in a big, thick book. The reality of the situation is that nothing significant has been accomplished yet. The student only has the information in a transportable form. He or she has not learned anything from the material. The information content of the photocopied sheets is just as foreign as if it had been left on the library shelf.",
		"A couple of years ago, I became interested in what we call hardship inoculation. This is the idea that struggling with a mental puzzle―trying to remember a phone number or deciding what to do on a long Sunday afternoon―inoculates you against future mental hardships just as vaccinations inoculate you against illness. There is good evidence to support the idea that small doses of mental hardship are good for us. Young adults do much better on tricky mental puzzles when they’ve solved difficult rather than easy ones earlier. Adolescent athletes also thrive on challenges: we’ve found, for example, that college basketball teams do better when their preseason schedules are more demanding. These mild initial struggles are critical. Depriving our kids of them by making everything easier is dangerous―we just don’t know how dangerous.",
		"According to the individualist form of rhetoric about science, still much used for certain purposes, discoveries are made in laboratories. They are the product of inspired patience, of skilled hands and an inquiring but unbiased mind. Moreover, they speak for themselves, or at least they speak too powerfully and too insistently for prejudiced humans to silence them. It would be wrong to suppose that such beliefs are not sincerely held, yet almost nobody thinks they can provide a basis for action in public contexts. Any scientist who announces a so-called discovery at a press conference without first permitting expert reviewers to examine his or her claims is automatically castigated as a publicity seeker. The norms of scientific communication presuppose that nature does not speak unambiguously, and that knowledge isn’t knowledge unless it has been authorized by disciplinary specialists. A scientific truth has little standing until it becomes a collective product. What happens in somebody’s laboratory is only one stage in its construction.",
		"The American anthropologist Margaret Mead once said, “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.” This same concept was echoed by Kelly Johnson: “The number of people having any connection with the project must be restricted in an almost vicious manner.” There are pretty good reasons for these opinions. Large or even medium­sized groups―corporations, movements, whatever― aren’t built to be flexible, nor are they willing to take large risks. Such organizations are designed to make steady progress and have considerably too much to lose to place the big bets that certain breakthroughs require. Fortunately, this is not the case with small groups. With no bureaucracy, little to lose, and a passion to prove themselves, when it comes to innovation, small teams consistently outperform larger organizations.",
		"Even though media coverage of sports is carefully edited and represented in total entertainment packages, most of us believe that when we see a sport event on television, we are seeing it “the way it is.” We don’t usually think that what we see, hear, and read is a series of narratives and images selected for particular reasons and grounded in the social worlds and interests of those producing the event, controlling the images, and delivering the commentary. Television coverage provides only one of many possible sets of images and narratives related to an event, and there are many images and messages that audiences do not receive. If we went to an event in person, we would see something quite different from the images selected and presented on television, and we would develop our own descriptions and interpretations, which would be very different from those carefully presented by media commentators.",
		"Radioactive waste disposal has become one of the key environmental battlegrounds over which the future of nuclear power has been fought. Environmentalists argue that no system of waste disposal can be absolutely safe, either now or in the future. Governments and the nuclear industry have tried to find acceptable solutions. But in countries where popular opinion is taken into consideration, no mutually acceptable solution has been found. As a result, most spent fuel has been stored in the nuclear power plants where it was produced. This is now causing its own problems as storage ponds designed to store a few years’ waste become filled or overflowing. One avenue that has been explored is the reprocessing of spent fuel to remove the active ingredients. Some of the recovered material can be recycled as fuel. The remainder must be stored safely until it has become inactive. But reprocessing has proved expensive and can exacerbate the problem of disposal rather than assisting it. As a result, it too appears publicly unacceptable.",
		"Through evolution, our brains have developed to deal with acute dangers, whether saber­toothed cats or thunderstorms. Our nerve connections will ensure that we become aware of the dangers and react to them to protect ourselves, being alerted by their peculiar smell, their threatening looks, or their scary noise. But nothing in our past has prepared us to deal with the insidious chemical threats that endanger the development of the next generation’s brains. On the contrary, we are thoroughly enjoying the immediate benefits of attractive consumer goods, efficient technologies, and handsome profits that we generate from producing and disseminating hazardous chemicals. Our senses are not geared toward detecting the underlying dangers. The irony is that the resulting harm to the brain may wipe out some of those senses that we badly need to manage this very problem.",
		"Although photocopiers are made for easy use by anyone, their complicated features and interfaces can make them frustrating. They need periodic maintenance―tasks that require specialized knowledge (such as how to install a toner cartridge or extract jammed paper) that tends to be unevenly distributed among users. These characteristics are wonderful stimuli for informal interactions, because they give people natural reasons to launch into conversation. We’ve observed employees turning to one another for help, watching one another to learn more about the machine, and commenting on its poor operation. These casual conversations can naturally lead to other subjects, some of them work related. And what is being copied can be as important as the fact that it is being copied. People gathered around might discover, in the documents coming off the machine, the write­up of a colleague’s project that’s relevant to their own work, or a new company policy that might affect them. Rich discussions often follow.",
		"The human brain wants to stay where it is, in the comfort zone. If we stay in our comfort zone, we don’t have to struggle to survive. We minimize the risk to our survival by staying where we know we are safe. I often explain to my MBA students that the reason they take the same seat in class every week is that we are, at our core, instinctual animals. Once we have chosen a seat and made it through class safely without being attacked, the part of our brain responsible for our survival tells us that our best option is to repeat that behavior, because in a way it is the most economical use of our energy. As part of its strategy for survival, our brain wants to conserve energy, so once we sit in a particular spot and know that it’s safe, we will subconsciously want to sit there every time and avoid having to reevaluate the safety of a new spot.",
		"Racial and ethnic relations in the United States are better today than in the past, but many changes are needed before sports are a model of inclusion and fairness. The challenges today are different from the ones faced twenty years ago, and experience shows that when current challenges are met, a new social situation is created in which new challenges emerge. For example, once racial and ethnic segregation is eliminated and people come together, they must learn to live, work, and play with each other despite diverse experiences and cultural perspectives. Meeting this challenge requires a commitment to equal treatment, plus learning about the perspectives of others, understanding how they define and give meaning to the world, and then determining how to form and maintain relationships while respecting differences, making compromises, and supporting one another in the pursuit of goals that may not always be shared. None of this is easy, and challenges are never met once and for all time.",
		"Taste is crucial to our survival. In a way, one might think of it as the most important of our senses―helping us to distinguish between that which is nutritious and that which may be poisonous. And yet, on closer inspection, it turns out not to be so important, at least not in terms of perception. While more than half of the brain is involved in processing what we see, only something like 1% of the cerebral cortex is directly involved in taste perception. The reason for this is that our brains pick up on the statistical regularities of the environment, and so we learn to predict the likely taste and nutritional properties of potential foodstuffs on the basis of other sensory cues, such as color and smell. This allows us to assess the likely consequences of ingesting a whole host of different foods without necessarily having to stick them into our mouths first in order to determine what they taste like.",
		"From the late nineteenth century on, the dullness found in the senile, their isolation and withdrawal, their clinging to the past and lack of interest in worldly affairs were characteristically represented as the symptoms of senility―the social shame of the inevitable deterioration of the brain. Following World War II, academic discourse on aging typically represented these as the causes of senility. The location of senile mental deterioration was no longer the aging brain but a society that, through involuntary retirement, social isolation, and the loosening of traditional family ties, stripped the elderly of the roles that had sustained meaning in their lives. When elderly people were deprived of these meaningful social roles, when they became increasingly isolated and were cut off from the interests and activities that had earlier occupied them, not surprisingly their mental functioning deteriorated. The elderly did not so much lose their minds as lose their place.",
		"I can report a number of occasions when my own dogs reacted in a marked, I would say enthusiastic, manner when I wore jingling jewelry that produced a regular rhythm as I walked, though admittedly they did not tap their feet. Although this is a mere anecdote, it suggests that it is wrong to claim that animals are incapable of responding to pronounced rhythms. The specific response of tapping one’s foot or deliberately marking any external rhythm does seem to be a particularly human skill, but this need not be interpreted as the decisive capacity involved in musical response. My dogs in fact responded to other musical features beside the regular jingling of my jewelry. The sound of a siren would set them to howling, as would the sound of my husband’s saxophone. Perhaps Aristotle observed similar reactions of dogs to musical instruments and rhythms. Apparently Darwin did. He reports observing a dog that was “always whining, when one note on a concertina, which was out of tune, was played.”",
		"Hierarchies are good at weeding out obviously bad ideas. By the time an idea makes it all the way up the chain, it will have been compared to all the other ideas in the system, with the obviously good ideas ranked at the top. This seems like common sense. The problem is that obviously good ideas are not truly innovative, and truly innovative ideas often look like very bad ideas when they’re introduced. Western Union famously passed on the opportunity to buy Alexander Graham Bell’s patents and technology for the telephone. At the time, phone calls were extremely noisy and easy to misinterpret, and they couldn’t span long distances, and Western Union knew from its telegram business that profitable communication depended on accuracy and widespread reach. And Wikipedia was considered a joke when it started. How could something written by a crowd replace the work of the world’s top scholars? Today it is so much more comprehensive than anything that came before it that it’s widely considered the only encyclopedia.",
		"A common error in current Darwinian thinking is the assumption that “selfish genes” are the prime mover in evolution. In strict Darwinism the prime mover is environmental threat. In the absence of threat, natural selection tends to resist change. It is un-biological to “explain” behavioural change as resulting from genetic change or the ex vacuo emergence of domain-specific brain modules. Evolutionary psychologists surely know why brains evolved: as Cosmides and Tooby point out, brains are found only in animals that move. Brains are behavioural organs, and behavioural adaptation, being immediate and non-random, is vastly more efficient than genetic adaptation. So, in animals with brains, behavioural change is the usual first response to environmental threat. If the change is successful, genetic adaptation to the new behaviour will follow more gradually. Animals do not evolve carnivore teeth and then decide it might be a good idea to eat meat.",
		"The borderless­world thesis has been vigorously criticized by many geographers on the grounds that it presents a simplistic and idealized vision of globalization. It appears that the more territorial borders fall apart, the more various groups around the world cling to place, nation, and religion as markers of their identity. In other words, the reduction in capacity of territorial borders to separate and defend against others often elicits adverse reactions in numerous populations. Difference between people and places may be socially constructed through the erection of boundaries, but this does not mean that it is not deeply internalized by the members of a society. So far, the consumption­dominated rhetoric of globalization has done little to uncouple the feeling of difference that borders create from the formation of people’s territorial identities.",
		"The discovery that man’s knowledge is not, and never has been, perfectly accurate has had a humbling and perhaps a calming effect upon the soul of modern man. The nineteenth century, as we have observed, was the last to believe that the world, as a whole as well as in its parts, could ever be perfectly known. We realize now that this is, and always was, impossible. We know within limits, not absolutely, even if the limits can usually be adjusted to satisfy our needs. Curiously, from this new level of uncertainty even greater goals emerge and appear to be attainable. Even if we cannot know the world with absolute precision, we can still control it. Even our inherently incomplete knowledge seems to work as powerfully as ever. In short, we may never know precisely how high is the highest mountain, but we continue to be certain that we can get to the top nevertheless.",
		"The view of AI breakthroughs that the public gets from the media－stunning victories over humans, robots becoming citizens of Saudi Arabia, and so on－bears very little relation to what really happens in the world’s research labs. Inside the lab, research involves a lot of thinking and talking and writing mathematical formulas on whiteboards. Ideas are constantly being generated, abandoned, and rediscovered. A good idea－a real breakthrough－will often go unnoticed at the time and may only later be understood as having provided the basis for a substantial advance in AI, perhaps when someone reinvents it at a more convenient time. Ideas are tried out, initially on simple problems to show that the basic intuitions are correct and then on harder problems to see how well they scale up. Often, an idea will fail by itself to provide a substantial improvement in capabilities, and it has to wait for another idea to come along so that the combination of the two can demonstrate value.",
		"There is a story about F. Yates, a prominent UK statistician. During his student years at St. John’s College, Cambridge, Yates had been keen on a form of sport. It consisted of climbing about the roofs and towers of the college buildings at night. In particular, the chapel of St. John’s College has a massive neo­Gothic tower adorned with statues of saints, and to Yates it appeared obvious that it would be more decorous if these saints were properly attired in surplices. One night he climbed up and did the job; next morning the result was generally much admired. But the College authorities were unappreciative and began to consider means of divesting the saints of their newly acquired garments. This was not easy, since they were well out of reach of any ordinary ladder. An attempt to lift the surplices off from above, using ropes with hooks attached, was unsuccessful. No progress was being made and eventually Yates came forward and volunteered to climb up in the daylight and bring them down. This he did to the admiration of the crowd that assembled.",
		"Moral philosophy textbooks often proclaim that we can discern if a claim is ethical by attending to the use of the words “is” and “ought.” On this suggestion, the claim “You ought to keep your promises,” because it uses “ought,” is ethical. “An atom is small,” because it uses “is,” is nonethical. Yet, despite being commonly invoked, this is-ought test is seriously deficient. Some is-statements have ethical content and some ought-statements do not. For example, consider the claims “Murder is wrong” and “Friendship is good.” These claims obviously have ethical content. Whatever the is-ought test is tracking, these claims clearly fall on the ought side of that divide. Yet they both use “is.” Similarly, consider the claim “The train ought to arrive in an hour.” This statement is clearly nonethical, the use of “ought” notwithstanding. There is an important distinction between ethical and nonethical claims. But we can’t simply rely on “is” and “ought” to make it. Instead we need to attend to the substance of the claim.",
		"Although cognitive and neuropsychological approaches emphasize the losses with age that might impair social perception, motivational theories indicate that there may be some gains or qualitative changes. Charles and Carstensen review a considerable body of evidence indicating that, as people get older, they tend to prioritize close social relationships, focus more on achieving emotional well-being, and attend more to positive emotional information while ignoring negative information. These changing motivational goals in old age have implications for attention to and processing of social cues from the environment. Of particular importance in considering emotional changes in old age is the presence of a positivity bias: that is, a tendency to notice, attend to, and remember more positive compared to negative information. The role of life experience in social skills also indicates that older adults might show gains in some aspects of social perception.",
		"Amazingly, many businesses evaluate their customer service strategy by the number of complaints they get. ‘We have very few complaints from our customers, so we don’t need customer service training at the moment.’ I am told this regularly when prospecting for new clients. Either that or, ‘The number of complaints has dramatically decreased this year and we are very pleased, it seems our customer service initiatives are working’. Companies using this type of measure are in denial. Although it is tempting to bury your head in the sand and believe no news is good news, trust me, if customers are not complaining to you, then they are complaining to other people or they are just never using your business again. The concerning thing is that customers who don’t complain there and then increasingly post their views on the Internet and through the social networking sites; they are no longer telling nine or so people but are probably telling thousands!",
		"The world has become a nation of laws and governance that has introduced a system of public administration and management to keep order. With this administrative management system, urban institutions of government have evolved to offer increasing levels of services to their citizenry, provided through a taxation process and/or fee for services (e.g., police and fire, street maintenance, utilities, waste management, etc.). Frequently this has displaced citizen involvement. Money for services is not a replacement for citizen responsibility and public participation. Responsibility of the citizen is slowly being supplanted by government being the substitute provider. Consequentially, there is a philosophical and social change in attitude and sense of responsibility of our urban-based society to become involved. The sense of community and associated responsibility of all citizens to be active participants is therefore diminishing. Governmental substitution for citizen duty and involvement can have serious implications. This impedes the nations of the world to be responsive to natural and man-made disasters as part of global preparedness.",
		"The most innovative teams are those that can restructure themselves in response to unexpected shifts in the environment; they don’t need a strong leader to tell them what to do. Moreover, they tend to form spontaneously; when like­minded people find each other, a group emerges. The improvisational collaboration of the entire group translates moments of individual creativity into group innovation. Allowing the space for this self­organizing emergence to occur is difficult for many managers because the outcome isn’t controlled by the management team’s agenda and is therefore less predictable. Most business executives like to start with the big picture and then work out the details. That’s why so many of the best examples of improvised innovation take place outside of formal organizations. In improvisational innovation, teams start with the details and then work up to the big picture. It’s riskier and less efficient, but when a successful innovation emerges, it’s often very surprising and imaginative.",
		"As much as we like to think of ourselves as being different and special, humans are a part of Earth’s biosphere, created within and by it. Ultimately, it is the living, breathing elements of this world that we need more than inanimate supplies, such as coal, gas, or bauxite ore. We can live without cars or beer cans, but we cannot without food and oxygen. As nations around the globe try to band together to attack the problems of greenhouse gas emissions and the shrinking availability of fresh drinking water, in all corners of the world thousands of species quietly go extinct. E. O. Wilson, the renowned Harvard biologist, recently presented the problem our species faces in a succinct law: “If you save the living environment, the biodiversity that we have left, you will also automatically save the physical environment, too. But if you only save the physical environment, you will ultimately lose both.”",
		"Chimpanzees are known to hunt and eat red colobus monkeys. Although a solo male typically initiates a hunt, others often join in, and hunting success is much higher when chimps hunt as a group rather than individually. During the hunt, chimpanzees adopt different roles: one male might flush the monkeys from their refuge, while another blocks the escape route. Somewhere else, an ambusher hides, ready to make his deadly move. Although this sounds a lot like teamwork, recent work offers a simpler interpretation. Chimps are more likely to join others for hunts because larger hunting groups increase each individual’s chance of catching a monkey—they aren’t interested in collective goals. The appearance of specialised roles in the hunt may also be an illusion: a simpler explanation is that each chimp places himself where his own chance of catching a monkey is highest, relative to the positions the others have already taken. Collaboration in chimps seems to emerge from an ‘every chimp for himself’ mentality.",
		"The approach, joint cognitive systems, treats a robot as part of a human-machine team where the intelligence is synergistic, arising from the contributions of each agent. The team consists of at least one robot and one human and is often called a mixed team because it is a mixture of human and robot agents. Self-driving cars, where a person turns on and off the driving, is an example of a joint cognitive system. Entertainment robots are examples of mixed teams as are robots for telecommuting. The design process concentrates on how the agents will cooperate and coordinate with each other to accomplish the team goals. Rather than treating robots as peer agents with their own completely independent agenda, joint cognitive systems approaches treat robots as helpers such as service animals or sheep dogs. In joint cognitive system designs, artificial intelligence is used along with human-robot interaction principles to create robots that can be intelligent enough to be good team members.",
		"On an antelope’s skull, the eye sockets are situated on the side of the head. This is because this animal spends a lot of its time with its head bent down to eat a low‑nutrient food: grass. While the animal is busy grazing, there will be predators out stalking for their food, so the antelope needs the greatest possible range of vision so that it has the maximum chance of seeing its predator and making an escape. With the eye sockets at the back of the head and on the side, it can see nearly 360° around itself. The eye of the antelope is also at the back of its head, giving it a long nose. If the eyes were at the front of the skull, vision would be obscured by long grass, so its long nose also gives an evolutionary advantage.",
		"Not only musicians and psychologists, but also committed music enthusiasts and experts often voice the opinion that the beauty of music lies in an expressive deviation from the exactly defined score. Concert performances become interesting and gain in attraction from the fact that they go far beyond the information printed in the score. In his early studies on musical performance, Carl Seashore discovered that musicians only rarely play two equal notes in exactly the same way. Within the same metric structure, there is a wide potential of variations in tempo, volume, tonal quality and intonation. Such variation is based on the composition but diverges from it individually. We generally call this ‘expressivity’. This explains why we do not lose interest when we hear different artists perform the same piece of music. It also explains why it is worthwhile for following generations to repeat the same repertoire. New, inspiring interpretations help us to expand our understanding, which serves to enrich and animate the music scene.",
		"In making sense of cave art, anthropologists have turned to surviving hunter‑gatherer societies that continue to paint inside caves, particularly the San peoples, who live in communities across a wide region of southern Africa. What began to fascinate anthropologists who studied the San was their detailed imitations of the animals they hunt. The hunters, in some sense, become animals in order to make inferences about how their prey might behave. This spills over into ritual. The San use hyperventilation and rhythmic movement to create states of altered consciousness as part of a shamanistic culture. In the final stage of a trance, Lewis‑Williams writes, ‘people sometimes feel themselves to be turning into animals and undergoing other frightening or exalting transformations’. For anthropologist Kim Hill, identifying and observing animals to eat and those to escape might merge into ‘a single process’ that sees animals as having humanlike intentions that ‘can influence and be influenced’.",
		"Every day an enormous amount of energy is created by the movement of people and animals, and by interactions of people with their immediate surroundings. This is usually in very small amounts or in very dispersed environments. Virtually all of that energy is lost to the local environment, and historically there have been no efforts to gather it. It may seem odd to consider finding ways to “collect” energy that is given off all around us—by people simply walking or by walking upstairs and downstairs or by riding stationary/exercise bicycles, for example—but that is the general idea and nature of energy harvesting. The broad idea of energy harvesting is that there are many places at which small amounts of energy are generated—and often wasted— and when collected, this can be put to some practical use. Current efforts have begun, aimed at collecting such energy in smaller devices which can store it, such as portable batteries.",
		"There was once a certain difficulty with the moons of Jupiter that is worth remarking on. These satellites were studied very carefully by Roemer, who noticed that the moons sometimes seemed to be ahead of schedule, and sometimes behind. They were ahead when Jupiter was particularly close to the earth and they were behind when Jupiter was farther from the earth. This would have been a very difficult thing to explain according to the law of gravitation. If a law does not work even in one place where it ought to, it is just wrong. But the reason for this discrepancy was very simple and beautiful: it takes a little while to see the moons of Jupiter because of the time it takes light to travel from Jupiter to the earth. When Jupiter is closer to the earth the time is a little less, and when it is farther from the earth, the time is more. This is why moons appear to be, on the average, a little ahead or a little behind, depending on whether they are closer to or farther from the earth.",
		"Hyper-mobility―the notion that more travel at faster speeds covering longer distances generates greater economic success―seems to be a distinguishing feature of urban areas, where more than half of the world’s population currently reside. By 2005, approximately 7.5 billion trips were made each day in cities worldwide. In 2050, there may be three to four times as many passenger-kilometres travelled as in the year 2000, infrastructure and energy prices permitting. Freight movement could also rise more than threefold during the same period. Mobility flows have become a key dynamic of urbanization, with the associated infrastructure invariably constituting the backbone of urban form. Yet, despite the increasing level of urban mobility worldwide, access to places, activities and services has become increasingly difficult. Not only is it less convenient―in terms of time, cost and comfort― to access locations in cities, but the very process of moving around in cities generates a number of negative externalities. Accordingly, many of the world’s cities face an unprecedented accessibility crisis, and are characterized by unsustainable mobility systems.",
		"Melody is one of the primary ways that our expectations are controlled by composers. Music theorists have identified a principle called gap fill; in a sequence of tones, if a melody makes a large leap, either up or down, the next note should change direction. A typical melody includes a lot of stepwise motion, that is, adjacent tones in the scale. If the melody makes a big leap, theorists describe a tendency for the melody to “want” to return to the jumping­off point; this is another way to say that our brains expect that the leap was only temporary, and tones that follow need to bring us closer and closer to our starting point, or harmonic “home.” In “Over the Rainbow,” the melody begins with one of the largest leaps we’ve ever experienced in a lifetime of music listening: an octave. This is a strong schematic violation, and so the composer rewards and soothes us by bringing the melody back toward home again, but not by too much because he wants to continue to build tension. The third note of this melody fills the gap.",
		"Before the web, newspaper archives were largely the musty domain of professional researchers and journalism students. Journalism was, by definition, current. The general accessibility of archives has greatly extended the shelf life of journalism, with older stories now regularly cited to provide context for more current ones. With regard to how meaning is made of complex issues encountered in the news, this departure can be understood as a readiness by online news consumers to engage with the underlying issues and contexts of the news that was not apparent in, or even possible for, print consumers. One of the emergent qualities of online news, determined in part by the depth of readily accessible online archives, seems to be the possibility of understanding news stories as the manifest outcomes of larger economic, social and cultural issues rather than short-lived and unconnected media spectacles.",
		"When you break up with a partner or close friend, the natural response (after having a good cry, obviously) is to blame yourself. You wonder what you did wrong and what you might have done differently. Bonds can help us reach a more balanced perspective; there are some bonds that were simply never meant to last, even if they played an essential role in your evolution to this point. Perhaps the most valuable thing is to know that seeing bonds break doesn’t have to break us. In chemistry, by definition, a change in the atomic bonding is not just the end of one state, but the beginning of another: creating the space for new bonding potential. The same is true for us as humans. It might take a cup of warm milk to reset us and give us comfort after a relationship has broken down. But however many bonds we see come apart, we will always retain one of our most human abilities: to connect afresh, find new friends and love again.",
		"Distance in time is like distance in space. People matter even if they live thousands of miles away. Likewise, they matter even if they live thousands of years hence. In both cases, it’s easy to mistake distance for unreality, to treat the limits of what we can see as the limits of the world. But just as the world does not stop at our doorstep or our country’s borders, neither does it stop with our generation, or the next. These ideas are common sense. A popular proverb says, “A society grows great when old men plant trees under whose shade they will never sit.” When we dispose of radioactive waste, we don’t say, “Who cares if this poisons people centuries from now?” Similarly, few of us who care about climate change or pollution do so solely for the sake of people alive today. We build museums and parks and bridges that we hope will last for generations; we invest in schools and longterm scientific projects; we preserve paintings, traditions, languages; we protect beautiful places. In many cases, we don’t draw clear lines between our concerns for the present and the future―both are in play.",
		"At some time in their lives, most people pause to reflect on their own moral principles and on the practical implications of those principles, and they sometimes think about what principles people should have or which moral standards can be best justified. When a person accepts a moral principle, naturally the person believes the principle is important and well justified. But there is more to moral principles than that. When a principle is part of a person’s moral code, that person is strongly motivated toward the conduct required by the principle, and against behavior that conflicts with that principle. The person will tend to feel guilty when his or her own conduct violates that principle and to disapprove of others whose behavior conflicts with it. Likewise, the person will tend to hold in esteem those whose conduct shows an abundance of the motivation required by the principle.",
		"The key to successful risk taking is to understand that the actions you’re taking should be the natural next step. One of the mistakes we often make when confronting a risk situation is our tendency to focus on the end result. Skiers who are unsure of themselves often do this. They’ll go to the edge of a difficult slope, look all the way down to the bottom, and determine that the slope is too steep for them to try. The ones that decide to make it change their focus by analyzing what they need to do to master the first step, like getting through the first mogul on the hill. Once they get there, they concentrate on the next mogul, and over the course of the run, they end up at the bottom of what others thought was an impossible mountain.",
		"When we remark with surprise that someone “looks young” for his or her chronological age, we are observing that we all age biologically at different rates. Scientists have good evidence that this apparent difference is real. It is likely that age changes begin in different parts of the body at different times and that the rate of annual change varies among various cells, tissues, and organs, as well as from person to person. Unlike the passage of time, biological aging resists easy measurement. What we would like to have is one or a few measurable biological changes that mirror all other biological age changes without reference to the passage of time, so that we could say, for example, that someone who is chronologically eighty years old is biologically sixty years old. This kind of measurement would help explain why one eighty-year-old has so many more youthful qualities than does another eighty-year-old, who may be biologically eighty or even ninety years old.",
		"As a system for transmitting specific factual information without any distortion or ambiguity, the sign system of honey-bees would probably win easily over human language every time. However, language offers something more valuable than mere information exchange. Because the meanings of words are not invariable and because understanding always involves interpretation, the act of communicating is always a joint, creative effort. Words can carry meanings beyond those consciously intended by speakers or writers because listeners or readers bring their own perspectives to the language they encounter. Ideas expressed imprecisely may be more intellectually stimulating for listeners or readers than simple facts. The fact that language is not always reliable for causing precise meanings to be generated in someone else’s mind is a reflection of its powerful strength as a medium for creating new understanding. It is the inherent ambiguity and adaptability of language as a meaning-making system that makes the relationship between language and thinking so special.",
		"The film director, as compared to the theater director, has as his material, the finished, recorded celluloid. This material from which his final work is composed consists not of living men or real landscapes, not of real, actual stage-sets, but only of their images, recorded on separate strips that can be shortened, altered, and assembled according to his will. The elements of reality are fixed on these pieces; by combining them in his selected sequence, shortening and lengthening them according to his desire, the director builds up his own “filmic” time and “filmic” space. He does not adapt reality, but uses it for the creation of a new reality, and the most characteristic and important aspect of this process is that, in it, laws of space and time invariable and inescapable in work with actuality become obedient. The film assembles from them a new reality proper only to itself.",
		"Individual authors and photographers have rights to their intellectual property during their lifetimes, and their heirs have rights for 70 years after the creator’s death, so any publication less than 125 years old has to be checked for its copyright status. The duration of copyright protection has increased steadily over the years; the life-plus-70-years standard was set by the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998, which increased the 50-year limit established by the 1976 Copyright Act. Supporters of such legislation like to defend these increases with tales of starving writers and their impoverished descendants, but in reality the beneficiaries are more likely to be transnational publishing companies. And note that copyright laws serve a dual purpose. In addition to protecting the rights of authors so as to encourage the publication of new creative works, copyright is also supposed to place reasonable time limits on those rights so that outdated works may be incorporated into new creative efforts. Therefore, the extended copyright protection frustrates new creative endeavors such as including poetry and song lyrics on Internet sites.",
		"A defining element of catastrophes is the magnitude of their harmful consequences. To help societies prevent or reduce damage from catastrophes, a huge amount of effort and technological sophistication are often employed to assess and communicate the size and scope of potential or actual losses. This effort assumes that people can understand the resulting numbers and act on them appropriately. However, recent behavioral research casts doubt on this fundamental assumption. Many people do not understand large numbers. Indeed, large numbers have been found to lack meaning and to be underestimated in decisions unless they convey affect (feeling). This creates a paradox that rational models of decision making fail to represent. On the one hand, we respond strongly to aid a single individual in need. On the other hand, we often fail to prevent mass tragedies or take appropriate measures to reduce potential losses from natural disasters.",
		"Invasions of natural communities by non-indigenous species are currently rated as one of the most important global-scale environmental problems. The loss of biodiversity has generated concern over the consequences for ecosystem functioning and thus understanding the relationship between both has become a major focus in ecological research during the last two decades. The “biodiversity-invasibility hypothesis” by Elton suggests that high diversity increases the competitive environment of communities and makes them more difficult to invade. Numerous biodiversity experiments have been conducted since Elton’s time and several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the often observed negative relationship between diversity and invasibility. Beside the decreased chance of empty ecological niches but the increased probability of competitors that prevent invasion success, diverse communities are assumed to use resources more completely and, therefore, limit the ability of invaders to establish. Further, more diverse communities are believed to be more stable because they use a broader range of niches than species-poor communities.",
		"People don’t usually think of touch as a temporal phenomenon, but it is every bit as time-based as it is spatial. You can carry out an experiment to see for yourself. Ask a friend to cup his hand, palm face up, and close his eyes. Place a small ordinary object in his palm―a ring, an eraser, anything will do―and ask him to identify it without moving any part of his hand. He won’t have a clue other than weight and maybe overall size. Then tell him to keep his eyes closed and move his fingers over the object. He’ll most likely identify it at once. By allowing the fingers to move, you’ve added time to the sensory perception of touch. There’s a direct analogy between the fovea at the center of your retina and your fingertips, both of which have high acuity. Your ability to make complex use of touch, such as buttoning your shirt or unlocking your front door in the dark, depends on continuous time-varying patterns of touch sensation.",
		"Mending and restoring objects often require even more creativity than original production. The preindustrial blacksmith made things to order for people in his immediate community; customizing the product, modifying or transforming it according to the user, was routine. Customers would bring things back if something went wrong; repair was thus an extension of fabrication. With industrialization and eventually with mass production, making things became the province of machine tenders with limited knowledge. But repair continued to require a larger grasp of design and materials, an understanding of the whole and a comprehension of the designer’s intentions. “Manufacturers all work by machinery or by vast subdivision of labour and not, so to speak, by hand,” an 1896 Manual of Mending and Repairing explained. “But all repairing must be done by hand. We can make every detail of a watch or of a gun by machinery, but the machine cannot mend it when broken, much less a clock or a pistol!”",
		"Different parts of the brain’s visual system get information on a need-to-know basis. Cells that help your hand muscles reach out to an object need to know the size and location of the object, but they don’t need to know about color. They need to know a little about shape, but not in great detail. Cells that help you recognize people’s faces need to be extremely sensitive to details of shape, but they can pay less attention to location. It is natural to assume that anyone who sees an object sees everything about it―the shape, color, location, and movement. However, one part of your brain sees its shape, another sees color, another detects location, and another perceives movement. Consequently, after localized brain damage, it is possible to see certain aspects of an object and not others. Centuries ago, people found it difficult to imagine how someone could see an object without seeing what color it is. Even today, you might find it surprising to learn about people who see an object without seeing where it is, or see it without seeing whether it is moving.",
		"The concept of overtourism rests on a particular assumption about people and places common in tourism studies and the social sciences in general. Both are seen as clearly defined and demarcated. People are framed as bounded social actors either playing the role of hosts or guests. Places, in a similar way, are treated as stable containers with clear boundaries. Hence, places can be full of tourists and thus suffer from overtourism. But what does it mean for a place to be full of people? Indeed, there are examples of particular attractions that have limited capacity and where there is actually no room for more visitors. This is not least the case with some man-made constructions such as the Eiffel Tower. However, with places such as cities, regions or even whole countries being promoted as destinations and described as victims of overtourism, things become more complex. What is excessive or out of proportion is highly relative and might be more related to other aspects than physical capacity, such as natural degradation and economic leakages (not to mention politics and local power dynamics).",
		"Biology is the smallest level at which we could explain creativity. Biology’s units of analysis are genes, DNA, and specific regions of the human brain. In general, scientists agree that explanations at such lower levels of analysis are more general, more universal, more powerful, and have fewer exceptions than explanations at higher levels of analysis—like the explanations of psychology or sociology. It always makes scientific sense to start your study by attempting to explain something at the lowest possible level. However, at present the biological approach cannot explain creativity and all of the evidence suggests that creativity is not coded in our genes. And decades of study have found no evidence that creativity is localized to any specific brain region; in fact, all of the evidence suggests that creativity is a whole­brain function, drawing on many diverse areas of the brain in a complex systemic fashion. And there is no evidence of a link between mental illness and creativity. To explain creativity, we need to look to the higher levels of explanation offered by psychology, sociology, and history.",
		"The researchers had made this happen by lengthening the period of daylight to which the peach trees on whose roots the insects fed were exposed. Exactly how cicadas keep track of time has always intrigued researchers, and it has always been assumed that the insects must rely on an internal clock. Recently, however, one group of scientists working with the 17-year cicada in California have suggested that the nymphs use an external cue and that they can count. For their experiments they took 15-year-old nymphs and moved them to an experimental enclosure. These nymphs should have taken a further two years to emerge as adults, but in fact they took just one year. The researchers had made this happen by lengthening the period of daylight to which the peach trees on whose roots the insects fed were exposed. By doing this, the trees were “tricked” into flowering twice during the year rather than the usual once. Flowering in trees coincides with a peak in amino acid concentrations in the sap that the insects feed on. So it seems that the cicadas keep track of time by counting the peaks.",
		"Some years ago, a psychologist named Richard Lippa called a group of introverts to his lab and asked them to act like extroverts while pretending to teach a math class. Then he and his team, with video cameras in hand, measured the length of their strides, the amount of eye contact they made with their “students,” the percentage of time they spent talking, and the volume of their speech. They also rated how generally extroverted those fake extroverts appeared, based on their recorded voices and body language. Then Lippa did the same thing with actual extroverts and compared the results. He found that although the latter group came across as more extroverted, some of the fake extroverts were surprisingly convincing. It seems that most of us know how to fake it to some extent. Whether or not we’re aware that the length of our strides and the amount of time we spend talking and smiling mark us as introverts and extroverts, we know it unconsciously.",

		"Remember when you were little and you imagined that adults had infinite power? Surely someone who could drive the car, open the juice container, and reach the sink could make it stop raining. I think that’s the same expectation that we have with respect to our dogs and their ability to smell. Because they are so good at using their noses, we assume that they can smell anything, anytime. But dogs use other senses, too, and the brains of both humans and dogs tend to intensify one sense at a time. Many owners have been snapped at by their dogs when they returned home with a new hairdo or a new coat. Surprised by the vision of an unfamiliar silhouette pushing into the house, these dogs were using their eyes instead of their noses. Their noses may be remarkable, but they’re not always switched on.",
		"Money―beyond the bare minimum necessary for food and shelter―is nothing more than a means to an end. Yet so often we confuse means with ends, and sacrifice happiness (end) for money (means). It is easy to do this when material wealth is elevated to the position of the ultimate end, as it so often is in our society. This is not to say that the accumulation and production of material wealth is in itself wrong. Material prosperity can help individuals, as well as society, attain higher levels of happiness. Financial security can liberate us from work we do not find meaningful and from having to worry about the next paycheck. Moreover, the desire to make money can challenge and inspire us.Even so, it is not the money per se that is valuable, but the fact that it can potentially yield more positive experiences. Material wealth in and of itself does not necessarily generate meaning or lead to emotional wealth.",
		"What is the best order for a report, paper or other technical document? Of course, it must be logical; but that means simply that the paper must have connection and sequence, and a variety of orders is possible under this heading. Too many writers interpret the term logical to mean chronological, and it has become habitual to begin reports and papers with careful reviews of previous work. Usually, this is tactically weak. Most readers of reports and papers are reading the documents because they are interested in, and know something about, the subject. Therefore, to rehearse to them the findings of previous work is simply to bore them with unnecessary reminders. The interesting thing for them is the new information─the new findings and conclusions. So it is usually best to start with those pieces of information. To give a long chronological account of work or procedures is normally appropriate only when the essential point of the paper is the chronological sequence.",
		"I expect that global society will increase annual investments from 24% today to 36% of the GDP in 2052. Much of this investment will be in energy-efficient goods that are more expensive than old-fashioned stuff designed for an era of cheap energy. Another share will be invested in the shift from coal to more expensive fuels, like conventional gas. Some will go into the construction of new renewable energy supply, even during the years before it becomes competitive. And a lot will go into repair of climate damage or adaptation to future climate damage─for example, investing in new protective walls along the coast to keep the rising ocean back. These huge increases in investment would not come about if investment was left to the market. Rather, they will happen only through state intervention, based on parliamentary decision. It will be either direct, when the government invests the tax dollars in whatever capacity it considers to be most necessary, or indirect, when the government passes legislation that makes the desired activity more profitable.",
		"Both humans and rats have evolved taste preferences for sweet foods, which provide rich sources of calories. A study of food preferences among the Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania found that honey was the most highly preferred food item, an item that has the highest caloric value. Human newborn infants also show a strong preference for sweet liquids. Both humans and rats dislike bitter and sour foods, which tend to contain toxins. They also adaptively adjust their eating behavior in response to deficits in water, calories, and salt. Experiments show that rats display an immediate liking for salt the first time they experience a salt deficiency. They likewise increase their intake of sweets and water when their energy and fluids become depleted. These appear to be specific evolved mechanisms, designed to deal with the adaptive problem of food selection, and coordinate consumption patterns with physical needs.",
		"An incident in Japan in the 1950s alerted the world to the potential problems of organic mercury in fish. Factories were discharging mercury into the waters of Minamata Bay, which also harbored a commercial fishing industry. Mercury was being bioaccumulated in the fish tissue and severe mercury poisoning occurred in many people who consumed the fish. The disabling neurological symptoms were subsequently called Minamata disease. Control over direct discharge of mercury from industrial operations is clearly needed for prevention. However, it is now recognized that traces of mercury can appear in lakes far removed from any such industrial discharge. It is postulated that such contamination may result from airborne transport from remote power plants or municipal incinerators. Strictly controlled emission standards for such sources are needed to minimize this problem. Fish advisories have been issued for many lakes in the United States; these recommend limits on the number of times per month particular species of fish should be consumed.",
		"The printing press boosted the power of ideas to copy themselves. Prior to low-cost printing, ideas could and did spread by word of mouth. While this was tremendously powerful, it limited the complexity of the ideas that could be propagated to those that a single person could remember. It also added a certain amount of guaranteed error. The spread of ideas by word of mouth was equivalent to a game of telephone on a global scale. The advent of literacy and the creation of handwritten scrolls and, eventually, handwritten books strengthened the ability of large and complex ideas to spread with high fidelity. But the incredible amount of time required to copy a scroll or book by hand limited the speed with which information could spread this way. A well-trained monk could transcribe around four pages of text per day. A printing press could copy information thousands of times faster, allowing knowledge to spread far more quickly, with full fidelity, than ever before.",
		"A major challenge for map-makers is the depiction of hills and valleys, slopes and flatlands collectively called the topography. This can be done in various ways. One is to create an image of sunlight and shadow so that wrinkles of the topography are alternately lit and shaded, creating a visual representation of the shape of the land. Another, technically more accurate way is to draw contour lines. A contour line connects all points that lie at the same elevation. A round hill rising above a plain, therefore, would appear on the map as a set of concentric circles, the largest at the base and the smallest near the top. When the contour lines are positioned closely together, the hill’s slope is steep; if they lie farther apart, the slope is gentler. Contour lines can represent scarps, hollows, and valleys of the local topography. At a glance, they reveal whether the relief in the mapped area is great or small: a “busy” contour map means lots of high relief.",
		"Resident-bird habitat selection is seemingly a straightforward process in which a young dispersing individual moves until it finds a place where it can compete successfully to satisfy its needs. Initially, these needs include only food and shelter. However, eventually, the young must locate, identify, and settle in a habitat that satisfies not only survivorship but reproductive needs as well. In some cases, the habitat that provides the best opportunity for survival may not be the same habitat as the one that provides for highest reproductive capacity because of requirements specific to the reproductive period. Thus, individuals of many resident species, confronted with the fitness benefits of control over a productive breeding site, may be forced to balance costs in the form of lower nonbreeding survivorship by remaining in the specific habitat where highest breeding success occurs. Migrants, however, are free to choose the optimal habitat for survival during the nonbreeding season and for reproduction during the breeding season. Thus, habitat selection during these different periods can be quite different for migrants as opposed to residents, even among closely related species.",
		"The fragmentation of television audiences during recent decades, which has happened throughout the globe as new channels have been launched everywhere, has caused advertisers much concern. Advertisers look back nostalgically to the years when a single spot transmission would be seen by the majority of the population at one fell swoop. This made the television advertising of mass consumer products relatively straightforward―not to say easy―whereas today it is necessary for advertisers to build up coverage of their target markets over time, by advertising on a host of channels with separate audiences. Still, it is arguable that advertisers worry rather too much about this problem, as advertising in other media has always been fragmented. Moreover, advertisers gain considerable benefits from the price competition between the numerous broadcasting stations. And television remains much the fastest way to build up public awareness of a new brand or a new campaign. Seldom does a new brand or new campaign that solely uses other media, without using television, reach high levels of public awareness very quickly.",
		"Imagine I tell you that Maddy is bad. Perhaps you infer from my intonation, or the context in which we are talking, that I mean morally bad. Additionally, you will probably infer that I am disapproving of Maddy, or saying that I think you should disapprove of her, or similar, given typical linguistic conventions and assuming I am sincere. However, you might not get a more detailed sense of the particular sorts of way in which Maddy is bad, her typical character traits, and the like, since people can be bad in many ways. In contrast, if I say that Maddy is wicked, then you get more of a sense of her typical actions and attitudes to others. The word ‘wicked’ is more specific than ‘bad’. I have still not exactly pinpointed Maddy’s character since wickedness takes many forms. But there is more detail nevertheless, perhaps a stronger connotation of the sort of person Maddy is. In addition, and again assuming typical linguistic conventions, you should also get a sense that I am disapproving of Maddy, or saying that you should disapprove of her, or similar, assuming that we are still discussing her moral character.",
		"Designers draw on their experience of design when approaching a new project. This includes the use of previous designs that they know work― both designs that they have created themselves and those that others have created. Others’ creations often spark inspiration that also leads to new ideas and innovation. This is well known and understood. However, the expression of an idea is protected by copyright, and people who infringe on that copyright can be taken to court and prosecuted. Note that copyright covers the expression of an idea and not the idea itself. This means, for example, that while there are numerous smartphones all with similar functionality, this does not represent an infringement of copyright as the idea has been expressed in different ways and it is the expression that has been copyrighted. Copyright is free and is automatically invested in the author, for instance, the writer of a book or a programmer who develops a program, unless they sign the copyright over to someone else.",
		"Introduction of robots into factories, while employment of human workers is being reduced, creates worry and fear. It is the responsibility of management to prevent or, at least, to ease these fears. For example, robots could be introduced only in new plants rather than replacing humans in existing assembly lines. Workers should be included in the planning for new factories or the introduction of robots into existing plants, so they can participate in the process. It may be that robots are needed to reduce manufacturing costs so that the company remains competitive, but planning for such cost reductions should be done jointly by labor and management. Retraining current employees for new positions within the company will also greatly reduce their fear of being laid off. Since robots are particularly good at highly repetitive simple motions, the replaced human workers should be moved to positions where judgment and decisions beyond the abilities of robots are required.",
		"Cinema is valuable not for its ability to make visible the hidden outlines of our reality, but for its ability to reveal what reality itself veils―the dimension of fantasy. This is why, to a person, the first great theorists of film decried the introduction of sound and other technical innovations (such as color) that pushed film in the direction of realism. Since cinema was an entirely fantasmatic art, these innovations were completely unnecessary. And what’s worse, they could do nothing but turn filmmakers and audiences away from the fantasmatic dimension of cinema, potentially transforming film into a mere delivery device for representations of reality. As long as the irrealism of the silent black and white film predominated, one could not take filmic fantasies for representations of reality. But sound and color threatened to create just such an illusion, thereby destroying the very essence of film art. As Rudolf Arnheim puts it, “The creative power of the artist can only come into play where reality and the medium of representation do not coincide.”",
		"Parks take the shape demanded by the cultural concerns of their time. Once parks are in place, they are no inert stage― their purposes and meanings are made and remade by planners and by park users. Moments of park creation are particularly telling, however, for they reveal and actualize ideas about nature and its relationship to urban society. Indeed, what distinguishes a park from the broader category of public space is the representation of nature that parks are meant to embody. Public spaces include parks, concrete plazas, sidewalks, even indoor atriums. Parks typically have trees, grass, and other plants as their central features. When entering a city park, people often imagine a sharp separation from streets, cars, and buildings. There’s a reason for that: traditionally, park designers attempted to create such a feeling by planting tall trees at park boundaries, building stone walls, and constructing other means of partition. What’s behind this idea is not only landscape architects’ desire to design aesthetically suggestive park spaces, but a much longer history of Western thought that envisions cities and nature as antithetical spaces and oppositional forces.",
		"Negotiators should try to find ways to slice a large issue into smaller pieces, known as using salami tactics. Issues that can be expressed in quantitative, measurable units are easy to slice. For example, compensation demands can be divided into cents-per-hour increments or lease rates can be quoted as dollars per square foot. When working to fractionate issues of principle or precedent, parties may use the time horizon (when the principle goes into effect or how long it will last) as a way to fractionate the issue. It may be easier to reach an agreement when settlement terms don’t have to be implemented until months in the future. Another approach is to vary the number of ways that the principle may be applied. For example, a company may devise a family emergency leave plan that allows employees the opportunity to be away from the company for a period of no longer than three hours, and no more than once a month, for illness in the employee’s immediate family.",
		"Science is sometimes described as a winner-take-all contest, meaning that there are no rewards for being second or third. This is an extreme view of the nature of scientific contests.  Even those who describe scientific contests in such a way note that it is a somewhat inaccurate description, given that replication and verification have social value and are common in science. It is also inaccurate to the extent that it suggests that only a handful of contests exist. Yes, some contests are seen as world class, such as identification of the Higgs particle or the development of high temperature superconductors. But many other contests have multiple parts, and the number of such contests may be increasing. By way of example, for many years it was thought that there would be “one” cure for cancer, but it is now realized that cancer takes multiple forms and that multiple approaches are needed to provide a cure. There won’t be one winner―there will be many.",
		"Misprints in a book or in any written message usually have a negative impact on the content, sometimes (literally) fatally. The displacement of a comma, for instance, may be a matter of life and death. Similarly most mutations have harmful consequences for the organism in which they occur, meaning that they reduce its reproductive fitness. Occasionally, however, a mutation may occur that increases the fitness of the organism, just as an accidental failure to reproduce the text of the first edition might provide more accurate or updated information. At the next step in the argument, however, the analogy breaks down. A favorable mutation is going to be more heavily represented in the next generation, since the organism in which it occurred will have more offspring and mutations are transmitted to the offspring. By contrast, there is no mechanism by which a book that accidentally corrects the mistakes of the first edition will tend to sell better.",
		"A turtle doesn’t have automatic body temperature control like birds and mammals. Its temperature changes according to its environment. When it gets too cold, it digs a hole deep into the mud at the bottom of a pond or into the dirt of the forest. How can it breathe when it’s buried? The turtle stops breathing air through its nose and mouth. Instead it takes in air through its skin and an opening under its tail. And when spring comes and the ground warms up, the turtle digs itself out and starts breathing normally again.",
		"Photography has always played an important part in our understanding of how the universe works. Although telescopes help us see far beyond the limits of the naked eye, on their own they are still limited. Yet, attach a camera to them, and suddenly we can see so much more. Details are revealed that would otherwise be invisible. Indeed, 19th century astronomers working with the first astronomical cameras were astonished to discover that outer space was much more crowded than they had thought. Their first photographs of the night sky showed unknown stars and galaxies. Once cameras were taken on board rockets and orbiting satellites, they saw the universe clearly for the first time.",
		"When the Olympics returned to Greece in 2004, every medal winner was given an olive wreath along with their medal. The wreaths for the marathon winners, however, were going to be special. They were going to come from the oldest tree in Greece. Unfortunately there were two competitors from different villages. Both claimed their tree dated back to the time of the ancient Olympics. But neither of them was willing to cut it down and count the growth rings to prove it! In the end the wreath for the winner of the women’s marathon was made from one tree and that for the men’s gold medalist from the other.",
		"Are your friends more popular than you are? There doesn’t seem to be any obvious reason to suppose this is true, but it probably is. At work or school, we are all more likely to become friends with someone who has a lot of friends than we are to befriend someone with few friends. It’s not that we avoid co-workers and classmates with few friends; rather it’s more probable that we will be among a popular person’s friends simply because he or she has a large number of them. This simple realization is relevant not only to friends in real life, but also to followers on social media websites. In Twitter, for example, it gives rise to what might be called the follower paradox: most people have fewer followers than their followers do. Before you resolve to become more popular, remember that most people are in similar, sparsely populated boats.",
		"A friend of mine used to pay his young children $1 each time they wrote a thank‒you note. This policy may or may not work in the long run. It might turn out that, by writing enough thank‒you notes, the children will eventually learn the real point of them and continue to express gratitude for gifts, even when they are no longer paid to do so. It’s also possible that they will absorb the wrong lesson, and regard thank‒you notes as piecework, a burden to be performed for pay. In this case, the habit won’t take, and they will stop writing such notes once they are no longer paid. Worse, the bribes may corrupt their moral education and make it harder for them to learn the virtue of gratitude. Even if it increases production in the short run, the bribe for thank‒you notes will have failed, by inculcating the wrong way of valuing the good in question.",
		"In the late 1600s, Sir Issac Newton conducted a series of experiments involving prisms, light, and color, which form the basis of our current understanding of color. These experiments involved refracting white light through a prism―a simple triangular glass object that separates light waves into individual colors. The results revealed that light could actually be broken down into seven individual colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Until this discovery, it was assumed that a prism somehow “colored” the light passing through it. To prove this wrong, Newton reversed the process. He projected the colors back into the prism, which resulted in pure white light. Artists and scientists alike were amazed by this discovery that light is the source of all color.",
		"Shoppers usually have a limited amount of money to spend and a limited amount of time to shop. It is important to realize that shopping is really a search for information. You may obtain information from an advertisement, a friend, a salesperson, a label, a magazine article, the Internet, or several other sources. You may also gain information from actual use of the product, such as trying on a dress, test­driving a car, or taking advantage of a promotion at a fitness center. However, shoppers should understand that getting any of these sources of information has costs. These costs may include transportation costs and time. Only you can decide whether to take the costs or not.",
		"For the most part, people who live or work in cities walk throughout the day―to go from the parking lot to the office, to shop, and to run errands. It’s often easier and cheaper to walk a few blocks than to wait for a taxi or subway. In this way, exercise can be structured into the daily routine. This is not the case for people who live in the suburbs. Because the suburbs are spread out, it’s too far to walk to the office or run to the store. Walking to the bus stop used to provide at least some movement, but now most public transportation is limited, so suburban people drive everywhere. The price they pay is limited physical movement during the day.",
		"Fundamental differences may exist between men and women. Perhaps as a child you remember going to your mother when you broke that garage window with a baseball. You went to your mother instead of your father, because mom would be less likely to be upset. A study at Ohio State University found that women’s blood pressure rises less than men’s in response to an objective stressor. Other research, however, suggests that, as a whole, women may feel more stress than men. Ronald Kessler did a Harvard study and found that women feel stress more often because they generally take a more far-reaching view of life. For example, women may worry about many things at a time, while many men can classify their worries, dealing with only one problem or stressor before moving on to the next one.",
		"Students may not spontaneously bring their prior knowledge to bear on new learning situations. It is important to help students activate prior knowledge so they can build on it productively. Indeed, research suggests that even small instructional interventions can activate students’ relevant prior knowledge to positive effect.  For instance, in one famous study by Gick and Holyoak, college students were presented with two problems that required them to apply a certain mathematical concept. The researchers found that even when the students knew the solution to the first problem, the vast majority did not think to apply a similar solution to the second problem. However, when the instructor suggested to students that they think about the second problem in relation to the first, 80 percent of the student participants were able to solve it. In other words, with minor prompts and simple reminders, instructors can activate relevant prior knowledge so that students draw on it more effectively.",
		"Many years ago, a Hungarian military patrol was caught by a fierce snowstorm in the Swiss Alps. The soldiers were lost and frightened, but one of them found a map in his pocket. After consulting it, the soldiers built a shelter, planned their route, and then waited out the storm. When the weather cleared three days later, they made their way back to the base camp. Their commanding officer, relieved that his men had survived the snowstorm, asked how they made their way out. A young soldier showed the life­saving map to the officer, and he studied it carefully. He was shocked to see that it was a map of the Pyrenees Mountains that border Spain and France, not the Swiss Alps.",
		"A classic psychological experiment asks a group of people to wear headphones. In this experiment, spoken words are played through the headphones, but a different set of words is played to each ear. Participants are told to listen to the words being sent to one ear (say the left ear) and to repeat them aloud. When given these instructions, people are quite good at repeating the words that were spoken to that ear. However, they are unable to remember any of the words that they heard in the other ear, even if the same small set of words had been repeated a dozen times. This example shows that much of the information that is available to your ears does not make it too far into your head. You are selecting only a small amount of that information to be processed enough to know what words were being spoken.",
		"Fear of sharks has kept many pool swimmers from testing the ocean water. Especially, the 1975 blockbuster movie Jaws, featuring a series of shark attacks in a small beach community, provided vivid images that convinced many people that ocean swimming should be left to the big fish. However, the actual chance of being attacked by a shark is very small. You take a greater risk while driving to and from the beach. According to the International Shark Attack File, the low number of shark attacks indicates that these big fish do not feed on humans by nature. Most shark attacks are simply due to mistaken identity. In 2007, there were 71 reported shark attacks on humans worldwide and only one death, which is significantly lower than the 2007 death rate for bee stings and snake bites.",
		"Clearly there is no shortage of bacteria in our gut, which can make this next statement a little hard to believe. Our gut bacteria belong on the endangered species list. The average American adult has approximately 1,200 different species of bacteria residing in his or her gut. That may seem like a lot until you consider that the average native living in the Amazonas of Venezuela has roughly 1,600 species, a full third more. Similarly, other groups of humans with lifestyles and diets more similar to our ancient human ancestors have more varied bacteria in their gut than we Americans do. Why is this happening? Our overly processed Western diet, overuse of antibiotics, and sterilized homes are threatening the health and stability of our gut inhabitants.",
		"Most dictionaries list names of famous people. The editors must make difficult decisions about whom to include and whom to exclude. Webster’s New World Dictionary, for example, includes Audrey Hepburn but leaves out Spencer Tracy. It lists Bing Crosby, not Bob Hope; Willie Mays, not Micky Mantle. Executive editor Michael Agnes explains that names are chosen based on their frequency of use and their usefulness to the reader. According to him, however, entertainers who are alive are not included. For that very reason, Elton John and Paul McCartney aren’t in the dictionary, but both Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley, who died decades ago, are.",
		"It’s great to have people in your life who believe in you and cheer you on. They are truly interested in what you are trying to achieve and support you in all of your goals and efforts. Each of us needs people in our lives who encourage us so that we can feel confident in our capabilities and move forward toward our goals. But there will be times in your life when there is no one around to stand up and cheer you on. When this happens, don’t get depressed. Instead, become your own cheerleader. Give yourself a motivational pep talk because nobody knows your strengths and talents better than you and no one can motivate you better than you.",
		"The technique I use to train my puppy is called behavior capture which is different from the common training method. Normally you first give an order and reward your puppy only when he follows it. In behavior capture, however, you first have to wait until your dog performs the behavior you want him to. Simply watch your puppy’s activities, waiting for a particular behavior to occur; when one happens, reward him. For example, if you want to train him to lie down whenever you say, “Lie down,” you just have to wait until he happens to do so. Then, as soon as your puppy lies down, you give him the order, “Lie down,” and give him a treat as a reward. Once the puppy knows that there is a reward waiting, he treats the experience as a pleasant game.",
		"People sometimes say, ‘Everything happens for a reason.’ In one sense this is true. Everything does happen for a reason―which is to say that events have causes, and the cause always comes before the event. Tsunamis happen because of undersea earthquakes, and earthquakes happen because of shifts in the earth’s plates. That is the true sense of ‘everything happens for a reason,’ and here ‘reason’ means ‘past cause.’ But people sometimes use reason in a different sense to mean something like ‘purpose.’ They will say something like, ‘The reason for the tsunami was to punish us for our faults.’ It is surprising how often people depend on this kind of nonsense.",
		"The goal in anger management is to increase the options you have to express anger in a healthy way. By learning a variety of anger management strategies, you develop control, choices, and flexibility in how you respond to angry feelings. A person who has learned a variety of ways to handle anger is more competent and confident. And with competence and confidence comes the strength needed to cope with situations that cause frustration and anger. The development of a set of such skills further enhances our sense of optimism that we can effectively handle the challenges that come our way. In contrast, the individual who responds to anger in the same way every time has little capacity to constructively adapt his responses to different situations. Such individuals are more likely to feel frustrated and to have conflicts with others and themselves.",
		"In the late 1800s, the railroads were the biggest companies in the U.S.. Having achieved such a huge success, even changing the landscape of America, remembering WHY they started doing this business stopped being important to them. Instead, they became obsessed with WHAT they did―they were in the railroad business. This narrowing of perspective influenced their decision­making―they invested all their money in tracks and engines. But at the beginning of the twentieth century, a new technology was introduced: the airplane. And all those big railroad companies eventually went out of business. What if they had defined themselves as being in the mass transportation business? Perhaps they would have seen opportunities that they otherwise missed; they would own all the airlines today.",
		"Your personality and sense of responsibility affect not only your relationships with others, your job, and your hobbies, but also your learning abilities and style. Some people are very self-driven. They are more likely to be lifelong learners. Many tend to be independent learners and do not require structured classes with instructors to guide them.  Other individuals are peer-oriented and often follow the lead of another in unfamiliar situations. They are more likely to benefit from the assistance of a formal teaching environment. They may be less likely to pursue learning throughout life without direct access to formal learning scenarios or the influence of a friend or spouse.",
		"George Orwell wrote: “To see what is in front of your nose needs constant struggle.” We are surrounded by opportunities, but often we do not even see them. Professor Richard Wiseman did a dramatic and extreme test of this. He asked a group of volunteers to count the number of times a basketball team passed the ball. As they passed the ball, a man in a gorilla suit walked into the middle of the group, thumped his chest a bit and then walked off. Quite a few volunteers counted correctly, but only 5 out of over 20 volunteers noticed the gorilla. The same applies to our professional lives. We are so focused on keeping score and managing day to day that we do not notice the endless opportunities that are in front of our noses.",
		"Childhood friends—friends you’ve known forever—are really special. They know everything about you, and you’ve shared lots of firsts. When you hit puberty, however, sometimes these forever­friendships go through growing pains. You find that you have less in common than you used to. Maybe you’re into rap and she’s into pop, or you go to different schools and have different groups of friends. Change can be scary, but remember: Friends, even best friends, don’t have to be exactly alike. Having friends with other interests keeps life interesting—just think of what you can learn from each other.",
		"Geography influenced human relationships in Greece. Because the land made travel so difficult, the guest­host relationship was valued. If a stranger, even a poor man, appeared at your door, it was your duty to be a good host, to give him a shelter and share your food with him.  “We do not sit at a table only to eat, but to eat together,” said the Greek author Plutarch. Dining was a sign of the human community and differentiated men from beasts. In return, the guest had duties to his host. These included not abusing his host’s hospitality by staying too long, usually not more than three days. A violation of this relationship by either side brought human and divine anger.",
		"China’s frequent times of unity and Europe’s constant disunity both have a long history. The most productive areas of modern China were politically joined for the first time in 221 BC, and have remained so for most of the time since then.  It has had only a single writing system from the beginning, a single principal language for a long time, and solid cultural unity for two thousand years. In contrast, Europe has never come close to political unification. It was divided into 500 states in AD 1500, got down to a minimum of 25 states in the 1980s, and is now up again to over 40. It still has 45 languages, and even greater cultural diversity. The current disagreements about the issue of unifying Europe are typical of Europe’s disunity.",
		"Music appeals powerfully to young children. Watch preschoolers’ faces and bodies when they hear rhythm and sound―they light up and move eagerly and enthusiastically. They communicate comfortably, express themselves creatively, and let out all sorts of thoughts and emotions as they interact with music. In a word, young children think music is a lot of fun, so do all you can to make the most of the situation. Throw away your own hesitation and forget all your concerns about whether you are musically talented or whether you can sing or play an instrument. They don’t matter when you are enjoying music with your child. Just follow his or her lead, have fun, sing songs together, listen to different kinds of music, move, dance, and enjoy.",
		"Do hair and fingernails continue to grow after a person dies? The short answer is no, though it may not seem that way to the casual observer. That’s because after death, the human body dehydrates, causing the skin to shrink, or become smaller. This shrinking exposes the parts of the nails and hair that were once under the skin, causing them to appear longer than before. Typically, fingernails grow about 0.1 millimeters a day, but in order to grow, they need glucose—a simple sugar that helps to power the body. Once the body dies, there’s no more glucose. So skin cells, hair cells, and nail cells no longer produce new cells. Moreover, a complex hormonal regulation directs the growth of hair and nails, none of which is possible once a person dies.",
		"Reading is like skiing. When done well, when done by an expert, both reading and skiing are graceful, harmonious activities. When done by a beginner, both are awkward, frustrating, and slow. Learning to ski is one of the most embarrassing experiences an adult can undergo. After all, an adult has been walking for a long time; he knows where his feet are; he knows how to put one foot in front of the other in order to get somewhere. But as soon as he puts skis on his feet, it is as though he had to learn to walk all over again. He slips and slides, falls down, has trouble getting up, and generally looks—and feels—like a fool. It is the same with reading. Probably you have been reading for a long time, too, and starting to learn all over again would be humiliating.",
		"When we set a plan, we are very excited about it. In this stage, we can even imagine ourselves victoriously dancing on the top of that mountain, feeling successful and ultimately happy. However, when you start putting the plan into practice to achieve your goal, the happiness, excitement, and a lot of fuel suddenly disappear. That is because the road to your goal, the implementation of the plan is not as appealing as the plan. You can easily lose motivation when you face the plain reality of the road to success. The road is paved with grey stones and offers less intense emotions than those imagined at the beginning. When you reach the end and look back at the road, however, you’ll realize how much more valuable, colorful, and meaningful it was than you anticipated it to be in the moment.",
		"Although humans have been drinking coffee for centuries, it is not clear just where coffee originated or who first discovered it. However, the predominant legend has it that a goatherd discovered coffee in the Ethiopian highlands.  Various dates for this legend include 900 BC, 300 AD, and 800 AD. Regardless of the actual date, it is said that Kaldi, the goatherd, noticed that his goats did not sleep at night after eating berries from what would later be known as a coffee tree. When Kaldi reported his observation to the local monastery, the abbot became the first person to brew a pot of coffee and note its flavor and alerting effect when he drank it. Word of the awakening effects and the pleasant taste of this new beverage soon spread beyond the monastery. The story of Kaldi might be more fable than fact, but at least some historical evidence indicates that coffee did originate in the Ethiopian highlands.",
		"The philosopher G. A. Cohen provides an example of a camping trip as a metaphor for the ideal society. On a camping trip, he argues, it is unimaginable that someone would say something like, “I cooked the dinner and therefore you can’t eat it unless you pay me for my superior cooking skills.” Rather, one person cooks dinner, another sets up the tent, another purifies the water, and so on, each in accordance with his or her abilities. All these goods are shared and a spirit of community makes all participants happier. A camping trip where each person attempted to gain the maximum rewards from the other campers in exchange for the use of his or her talents would quickly end in disaster and unhappiness. Moreover, the experience would be ruined if people were to behave in such a way. So, we would have a better life in a more equal and cooperative society.",
		"In the classical fairy tale the conflict is often permanently resolved. Without exception, the hero and heroine live happily ever after. By contrast, many present­day stories have a less definitive ending. Often the conflict in those stories is only partly resolved, or a new conflict appears making the audience think further. This is particularly true of thriller and horror genres, where audiences are kept on the edge of their seats throughout. Consider Henrik Ibsen’s play, A Doll’s House, where, in the end, Nora leaves her family and marriage. Nora disappears out of the front door and we are left with many unanswered questions such as “Where did Nora go?” and “What will happen to her?” An open ending is a powerful tool, providing food for thought that forces the audience to think about what might happen next.",
		"When I was very young, I had a difficulty telling the difference between dinosaurs and dragons. But there is a significant difference between them. Dragons appear in Greek myths, legends about England’s King Arthur, Chinese New Year parades, and in many tales throughout human history. But even if they feature in stories created today, they have always been the products of the human imagination and never existed. Dinosaurs, however, did once live. They walked the earth for a very long time, even if human beings never saw them. They existed around 200 million years ago, and we know about them because their bones have been preserved as fossils.",
		"Acoustic concerns in school libraries are much more important and complex today than they were in the past. Years ago, before electronic resources were such a vital part of the library environment, we had only to deal with noise produced by people. Today, the widespread use of computers, printers, and other equipment has added machine noise. People noise has also increased, because group work and instruction are essential parts of the learning process. So, the modern school library is no longer the quiet zone it once was. Yet libraries must still provide quietness for study and reading, because many of our students want a quiet study environment. Considering this need for library surroundings, it is important to design spaces where unwanted noise can be eliminated or at least kept to a minimum.",
		"Have you heard someone say, “He has no one to blame but himself” for some problem? In everyday life we often blame people for “creating” their own problems. Although individual behavior can contribute to social problems, our individual experiences are often largely beyond our own control. They are determined by society as a whole― by its historical development and its organization. If a person sinks into debt because of overspending or credit card abuse, other people often consider the problem to be the result of the individual’s personal failings. However, thinking about it this way overlooks debt among people in low­income brackets who have no other way than debt to acquire basic necessities of life. By contrast, at middle­ and upper­income levels, overspending takes on a variety of meanings typically influenced by what people think of as essential for their well­being and associated with the so­called “good life” that is so heavily marketed. But across income and wealth levels, larger­scale economic and social problems may affect the person’s ability to pay for consumer goods and services.",
		"Traditionally, people were declared dead when their hearts stopped beating, their blood stopped circulating and they stopped breathing. So doctors would listen for a heartbeat, or occasionally conduct the famous mirror test to see if there were any signs of moisture from the potential deceased’s breath. It is commonly known that when people’s hearts stop and they breathe their last, they are dead. But in the last half­century, doctors have proved time and time again that they can revive many patients whose hearts have stopped beating by various techniques such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation. So a patient whose heart has stopped can no longer be regarded as dead. Instead, the patient is said to be ‘clinically dead’. Someone who is only clinically dead can often be brought back to life.",
		"The way we communicate influences our ability to build strong and healthy communities. Traditional ways of building communities have emphasized debate and argument. For example, the United States has a strong tradition of using town hall meetings to deliberate important issues within communities. In these settings, advocates for each side of the issue present arguments for their positions, and public issues have been discussed in such public forums. Yet for debate and argument to work well, people need to come to such forums with similar assumptions and values. The shared assumptions and values serve as a foundation for the discussion. However, as society becomes more diverse, the likelihood that people share assumptions and values diminishes. As a result, forms of communication such as argument and debate become polarized, which may drive communities apart as opposed to bringing them together.",
		"Forests have always had a role in human society. They have been a source of building timber and firewood, of wild game and foods like mushrooms. They have not, however, always been considered places of beauty. During the Middle Ages, especially in parts of Northern Europe, they developed a reputation for being places of darkness and fear, the home of evil spirits and wild beasts. In Germany you might have been attacked by werewolves or a semi-human Wild Man, a kind of ogre covered with coarse hair who ate children. Anglo-Saxon folk tales, such as the eighth-century Beowulf, frequently set the action in scary forests, a legacy inherited by the stories of Tolkien, in which friendly hobbits are extremely frightened at the thought of having to pass through the haunted Fangorn Forest. Out of this medieval vision comes our word ‘savage’, derived from silva, meaning a wood.",
		"Some people believe that the social sciences are falling behind the natural sciences. They maintain that not only does social science have no exact laws, but it also has failed to eliminate great social evils such as racial discrimination, crime, poverty, and war. They suggest that social scientists have failed to accomplish what might reasonably have been expected of them. Such critics are usually unaware of the real nature of social science and of its special problems and basic limitations. For example, they forget that the solution to a social problem requires not only knowledge but also the ability to influence people. Even if social scientists discover the procedures that could reasonably be followed to achieve social improvement, they are seldom in a position to control social action. For that matter, even dictators find that there are limits to their power to change society.",
		"Most of us have hired many people based on human resources criteria along with some technical and personal information that the boss thought was important. I have found that most people like to hire people just like themselves. This may have worked in the past, but today, with interconnected team processes, we don’t want all people who are the same. In a team, some need to be leaders, some need to be doers, some need to provide creative strengths, some need to be inspirers, some need to provide imagination, and so on. In other words, we are looking for a diversified team where members complement one another. When putting together a new team or hiring team members, we need to look at each individual and how he or she fits into the whole of our team objective. The bigger the team, the more possibilities exist for diversity.",
		"If leadership is the ability to create change your organization believes in, and the market demands change, then the market demands leaders, not managers. Managers manage by using the authority the factory gives them, and you listen to your manager to avoid losing your job. A manager can’t make change because that’s not his job; his job is to complete tasks assigned to him by someone else in the factory. Leaders, on the other hand, don’t care very much for organizational structure or the official blessing of whatever factory they work for. They use passion and ideas to lead people, as opposed to using threats and bureaucracy to manage them. Leaders must become aware of how the organization works, because this awareness allows them to change it. Leadership doesn’t always start at the top, but it always manages to affect the folks at the top.",
		"Imagine in your mind one of your favorite paintings, drawings, cartoon characters or something equally complex.  Now, with that picture in your mind, try to draw what your mind sees. Unless you are unusually gifted, your drawing will look completely different from what you are seeing with your mind’s eye. However, if you tried to copy the original rather than your imaginary drawing, you might find your drawing now was a little better. Furthermore, if you copied the picture many times, you would find that each time your drawing would get a little better, a little more accurate. Practice makes perfect. This is because you are developing the skills of coordinating what your mind perceives with the movement of your body parts.",
		"Some years ago at the national spelling bee in Washington, D.C., a thirteen­year­old boy was asked to spell echolalia, a word that means a tendency to repeat whatever one hears. Although he misspelled the word, the judges misheard him, told him he had spelled the word right, and allowed him to advance. When the boy learned that he had misspelled the word, he went to the judges and told them. So he was eliminated from the competition after all. Newspaper headlines the next day called the honest young man a “spelling bee hero,” and his photo appeared in The New York Times. “The judges said I had a lot of honesty,” the boy told reporters. He added that part of his motive was, “I didn’t want to feel like a liar.”",
		"Older adults often take longer to make a decision than young adults do. But that does not mean they are any less sharp. According to research at Ohio State University, the slower response time of older adults has more to do with prizing accuracy over speed. In the study, published recently in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, college­age students and adults aged 60 to 90 performed timed tests of word recognition and recall. All participants were equally accurate, but the older group responded more slowly. When the researchers encouraged them to work faster, however, they were able to match the youngsters’ speed without significantly sacrificing accuracy. “In many simple tasks, the elderly take longer mainly because they decide to require more evidence to make their decision,” says co­author Roger Ratcliff. When an older mind faces a task that requires speed, he says, a conscious effort to work faster can often do the trick.",
		"Whenever you say what you can’t do, say what you can do. This ends a sentence on a positive note and has a much lower tendency to cause someone to challenge it. Consider this situation―a colleague comes up to you and asks you to look over some figures with them before a meeting they are having tomorrow. You simply say, ‘No, I can’t deal with this now.’ This may then lead to them insisting how important your input is, increasing the pressure on you to give in. Instead of that, say to them, ‘I can’t deal with that now but what I can do is I can ask Brian to give you a hand and he should be able to explain them.’ Or, ‘I can’t deal with that now but I can find you in about half an hour when I have finished.’ Either of these types of responses are better than ending it with a negative.",
		"Whatever the benefit to a virus of a long­lived host, there is no guarantee that hosts have mechanisms for increasing longevity that the virus could exploit. Nor need host longevity be an advantage. The interests of the virus depend on its life­cycle strategy, and some viruses are only released on the death of the host. In fact, many parasites actually force their host to attack other potential hosts or to be killed or eaten so that the parasites are passed on. On the other hand, many of the germs that live in or on the bodies of all animals, including humans, are not simply parasitic, but contribute important protective, stimulant or nutritional effects. In some ways, this can be seen as a form of life extension because removing the germs could have drastic, possibly fatal effects on the host. Extreme examples include endosymbiont root fungi in orchids, or mitochondria in our cells. Without them, orchids and humans would not survive.",
		"Have you ever thought about how you can tell what somebody else is feeling? Sometimes, friends might tell you that they are feeling happy or sad but, even if they do not tell you, I am sure that you would be able to make a good guess about what kind of mood they are in. You might get a clue from the tone of voice that they use. For example, they may raise their voice if they are angry or talk in a shaky way if they are scared. The other main clue you might use to tell what a friend is feeling would be to look at his or her facial expression. We have lots of muscles in our faces which enable us to move our face into lots of different positions. This happens spontaneously when we feel a particular emotion.",
		"Psychologists make the distinction between dispositions, or traits, and states, or momentary feelings. Think of some moments of happiness or despair you have experienced, such as when you won a prize or got an exciting job offer, or when somebody died. These experiences are states of happiness or sadness; they reflect the transient highs and lows of everyday life. Traits, on the other hand, are more stable characteristics that endure across time. These are the emotional styles or ways of thinking that remain fairly steadfast across our lives. Mary has “Mary­like” characteristics that remain fairly stable, just as Dave stays “Dave­like” under all circumstances. Cheerful, happy babies tend to become adventurous, outgoing children who tend to become extroverted, sociable adults.",
		"Parents often believe that they are providing help to their children when they constantly correct and criticize them, assuming that they will grow from these remarks. But ask yourself: Do you like being corrected? Do you grow when you are constantly criticized? In truth, we tend to stay the same when we are criticized.We want to defend what we have done, and our innate stubbornness refuses to permit us to accept the criticism we are receiving.  Behind virtually all criticism is the sentence “If only you were more like me, and living life as I see it, you would be a lot better off.” But no one, even your child, is exactly like you. Praise your children for attempting a task, even if it was unsuccessful, and for taking risks. Create an environment in which your children know that you are with them in their efforts, rather than looking to criticize them.",
		"Self-fulfilling prophecies can have a positive side. We know that students introduced to their teachers as “intellectual bloomers” often do better on achievement tests than do their counterparts who lack such a positive introduction. In a study of army tank crews, one set of tank commanders was told that some members of their assigned crews had exceptional abilities while others were only average. In reality, the crew members had been assigned randomly so that the two test groups were equal in ability. The commanders later reported that the so-called “exceptional” crew members performed better than the “average” ones. The study also revealed the commanders had given more attention and praise to the crew members for whom they had the higher expectations. The self-fulfilling effects in these cases strongly suggest that managers adopt positive and optimistic approaches toward others at work.",
		"After the technical rehearsal, the theater company will meet with the director, technical managers, and stage manager to review the rehearsal. Usually there will be comments about all the good things about the performance. Individuals should make mental and written notes on the positive comments about their own personal contributions as well as those directed toward the crew and the entire company. Building on positive accomplishments can reduce nervousness. In addition to positive comments, the director and manager will undoubtedly have comments about what still needs work. Sometimes, these negative comments can seem overwhelming and stressful. Time pressures to make these last­minute changes can be a source of stress. Take each suggestion with good humor and enthusiasm and tackle each task one by one.",
		"Studies do show that motorists are more likely to yield to pedestrians in marked crosswalks than at unmarked crosswalks. But as some researchers found, that does not necessarily make things safer. When they compared the way pedestrians crossed at both kinds of crosswalks on roads with considerable traffic volumes, they found that people at unmarked crosswalks tended to look both ways more often, waited more often for gaps in traffic, and crossed the road more quickly. Researchers suspect that both drivers and pedestrians are more aware that drivers should yield to pedestrians in marked crosswalks. But neither are aware of this fact when it comes to unmarked crosswalks. Not knowing traffic safety laws, it turns out, is actually a good thing for pedestrians. Because they do not know whether cars are supposed to stop, they act more cautiously. Marked crosswalks, by contrast, may give pedestrians an unrealistic picture of their own safety.",
		"Achieving focus in a movie is easy. Directors can simply point the camera at whatever they want the audience to look at. Close-ups and slow camera shots can emphasize a killer’s hand or a character’s brief glance of guilt. On stage, focus is much more difficult because the audience is free to look wherever they like. The stage director must gain the audience’s attention and direct their eyes to a particular spot or actor. This can be done through lighting, costumes, scenery, voice, and movements. Focus can be gained by simply putting a spotlight on one actor, by having one actor in red and everyone else in gray, or by having one actor move while the others remain still. All these techniques will quickly draw the audience’s attention to the actor whom the director wants to be in focus.",
		"You’ve probably heard the expression, “first impressions matter a lot”. Life really doesn’t give many people a second chance to make a good first impression. It has been determined that it takes only a few seconds for anyone to assess another individual. This is very noticeable in recruitment processes, where top recruiters can predict the direction of their eventual decision on any candidate within a few seconds of introducing themselves. So, a candidate’s CV may ‘speak’ knowledge and competence, but their appearance and introduction may tell of a lack of coordination, fear, and poor interpersonal skills. In this way, quick judgements are not only relevant in employment matters; they are equally applicable in love and relationship matters too. On a date with a wonderful somebody who you’ve painstakingly tracked down for months, subtle things like bad breath or wrinkled clothes may spoil your noble efforts.",
		"Often, a word is used with more than one meaning. Indeed, a brief look at a dictionary will show you that the majority of words are used with more than one meaning. If such words were said to be ambiguous, then the vast majority of words would be ambiguous. However, linguists and philosophers usually call a word “ambiguous” only when there is some uncertainty about which meaning is being used in the particular instance. A word isn’t ambiguous by itself but is used ambiguously: it is ambiguous when one cannot tell from the context what sense is being used. However, in most cases one can tell from the context what sense is being used. For example, if you say “I’m going to the bank to deposit some money,” I don’t expect you to go to the river bank. The word “bank” has these two senses (and more), but it is not thereby ambiguous: the two senses are so unrelated that no one is likely to confuse them.",
		"When we read, we are alone. Reading calls us to our sole self, and away from the world of distractions; but it also furnishes us with far­reaching connections to other people. The peaceful calm of a desert island is not a bad image to have in your head as you prepare to read. No earthly storms can reach you here; you are safe. The desert island image reinforces the idea that reading is a fundamentally solitary experience. Reading has also always had a social dimension, however, as it does in our early lives: our first acts of reading are performed with parents and teachers standing by and guiding us. These mentors left their stamp on how we approach a text; they gave us the tools we use to get closer to the words on the page. There is, of course, another social connection in reading: we always converse, by implication, with the book’s author.",
		"There are some cultures that can be referred to as “people who live outside of time.” The Amondawa tribe, living in Brazil, does not have a concept of time that can be measured or counted. Rather they live in a world of serial events, rather than seeing events as being rooted in time. Researchers also found that no one had an age. Instead, they change their names to reflect their stage of life and position within their society, so a little child will give up their name to a newborn sibling and take on a new one. In the U.S. we have so many metaphors for time and its passing that we think of time as “a thing,” that is “the weekend is almost gone,” or “I haven’t got the time.” We think such statements are objective, but they aren’t. We create these metaphors, but the Amondawa don’t talk or think in metaphors for time.",
		"There is evidence that when we form impressions of others, we pay more attention to our first impressions. This tendency is called the ‘primacy effect.’ The primacy effect was documented in a famous study conducted by social psychologist Solomon Asch. Individuals were asked to evaluate two people based on two lists of adjectives. The list for the first person had the following adjectives: intelligent, industrious, impulsive, critical, stubborn, and envious. The list for the other person had the same adjectives, but in reverse order. Although the content was identical, respondents gave the first person a more positive evaluation than the second. One explanation for this is that the first words in each list created a first impression that respondents used to interpret the remaining adjectives. In a similar manner, the first impressions we form about someone often affect our impression of subsequent perceptions of that person.",
		"The natural world provides a rich source of symbols used in art and literature. Plants and animals are central to mythology, dance, song, poetry, rituals, festivals, and holidays around the world. Different cultures can exhibit opposite attitudes toward a given species. Snakes, for example, are honored by some cultures and hated by others. Rats are considered pests in much of Europe and North America and greatly respected in some parts of India. Of course, within cultures individual attitudes can vary dramatically. For instance, in Britain many people dislike rodents, and yet there are several associations devoted to breeding them, including the National Mouse Club and the National Fancy Rat Club.",
		"Heat and temperature are two quantities that can be easily confused. Imagine cooking a very large pot of chicken soup on the stove. Let’s suppose you heat the soup until it is 95℃, quite hot. You grab a spoon and take out a spoonful of soup to taste. As you remove the spoonful of soup from the pot, it has the same temperature as the larger sample. Unfortunately, as you bring the soup towards your mouth to taste it, the spoon slips from your hand, pouring its contents on your bare foot. The spoonful of 95℃ soup hitting your foot hurts, but not as badly as it would if you accidentally spilled the entire pot of 95℃ soup on your foot. If both the spoonful and the pot full of soup have the same temperature, why would the larger sample cause more damage if it came in contact with your skin? The answer to the question lies in the difference between temperature and heat.",
		"Currently, we cannot send humans to other planets. One obstacle is that such a trip would take years. A spacecraft would need to carry enough air, water, and other supplies needed for survival on the long journey. Another obstacle is the harsh conditions on other planets, such as extreme heat and cold. Some planets do not even have surfaces to land on. Because of these obstacles, most research missions in space are accomplished through the use of spacecraft without crews aboard. These explorations pose no risk to human life and are less expensive than ones involving astronauts. The spacecraft carry instruments that test the compositions and characteristics of planets.",
		"People make extensive use of searching images. One unexpected context is sorting. Suppose you have a bag of small hardware―screws, nails, and so on―and you decide to organize them into little jars. You dump the stuff out on a table and begin separating the items into coherent groups. It is possible to do this by randomly picking up individual objects, one by one, identifying each one, and then moving it to the appropriate jar. But what most people do is very different. They quickly pick out a whole series of items of the same type, making a handful of, say, small screws. They put them in the jar and then go back and do the same for a different kind of item. So the sorting sequence is nonrandom, producing runs of items of a single type. It is a faster, more efficient technique, and much of the increased efficiency is due to the use of searching images.",
		"Our brains are constantly solving problems. Every time we learn, or remember, or make sense of something, we solve a problem. Some psychologists have characterized all infant language‒learning as problem‒solving, extending to children such scientific procedures as “learning by experiment,” or “hypothesis‒testing.” Grown‒ups rarely explain the meaning of new words to children, let alone how grammatical rules work. Instead they use the words or the rules in conversation and leave it to children to figure out what is going on. In order to learn language, an infant must make sense of the contexts in which language occurs; problems must be solved. We have all been solving problems of this kind since childhood, usually without awareness of what we are doing.",
		"“We have two kinds of attention,” says Andrea Faber Taylor, an environmental psychologist at the University of Illinois. The first is the “directed attention” we call on for tasks that require focus, like driving or doing our taxes. Directed attention tends to be tiring, however, and fatigue affects our ability to make good decisions and control destructive impulses. The best way to restore directed attention is to give it a rest by shifting to the second type, “involuntary attention,” which we display when we meditate. Looking at nature is another activity that gives our directed attention a chance to recover. For example, Roger Ulrich at Texas A&M University found that people who commuted along scenic roads recovered more quickly from stressful driving conditions than those who saw billboards, buildings, and parking lots. Ulrich also looked at patients recovering from surgery. The patients who could see trees from their hospital beds needed fewer painkillers and had shorter hospital stays than those who looked out on brick walls.",
		"Reciprocity can be explored in captivity by handing one chimpanzee a large amount of food, such as a watermelon or leafy branch, and then observing what follows. The owner will be center stage, with a group of others around him or her, soon to be followed by newly formed groups around those who obtained a sizable share, until all food has been distributed. Beggars may complain and cry, but aggressive conflicts are rare. The few times that they do occur, it is the possessor who tries to make someone leave the circle. She will hit them over their head with her branch or bark at them in a high­pitched voice until they leave her alone. Whatever their rank, possessors control the food flow. Once chimpanzees enter reciprocity mode, their social rank no longer matters.",
		"Parallel to new trends in the natural sciences and humanities, the realists focused on fact and perception, thus rejecting art that was based only on imaginary worlds. However, they never sought to simply imitate reality since that would have been easier with photography, which had just recently been invented. Instead, painters like Gustave Courbet, Adolf von Menzel, Jean‒François Millet, and Honoré Daumier wanted to illustrate social conditions within their art. In particular, artists chose motifs taken from industrial and rural worlds of life and labor. Previously, these subjects had been handled at most in small, anecdotal genre paintings. Courbet broke with this tradition and provided art history with its first public scandal with the painting “Burial at Ornans\" It portrayed an ordinary funeral and the rural mourners on a monumental scale, challenging the accepted norms of the art establishment at that time.",
		"Gender research shows a complex relationship between gender and conflict styles. Some research suggests that women from Western cultures tend to be more caring than men. This tendency may result from socialization processes in which women are encouraged to care for their families and men are encouraged to be successful in competitive work environments. However, we live in a society where gender roles and boundaries are not as strict as in prior generations. There is significant variability in assertiveness and cooperation among women, as well as among men. Although conflict resolution experts should be able to recognize cultural and gender differences, they should also be aware of within­group variations and the risks of stereotyping. Culture and gender may affect the way people perceive, interpret, and respond to conflict; however, we must be careful to avoid overgeneralizations and to consider individual differences.",
		"A 5-year-old doing addition problems by counting on makes the same error repeatedly, with responses such as: 7 + 3 = 9, 6+5=10 and 8+4=11. The teacher asks the pupil to show how these answers were obtained and notices that in doing the addition of 3 to 7, the pupil counts ‘seven, eight, nine’, while turning up three fingers in turn. The pupil is ‘counting on 3 from 7’ but incorrectly starting at 7. The teacher recalls similar errors that some pupils made when doing addition problems by counting on along a number line. Analysis of the errors leads the teacher to modify the teaching of these procedures, using the language ‘seven and three more’ rather than ‘seven, count on three’. This is immediately effective. So the teacher reinforces this particular language pattern in subsequent oral work with the whole class.",
		"Daylight isn’t the only signal that the brain can use for the purpose of biological clock resetting, though it is the principal and preferential signal, when present. So long as they are reliably repeating, the brain can also use other external cues, such as food, exercise, and even regularly timed social interaction. All of these events have the ability to reset the biological clock, allowing it to strike a precise twenty-four-hour note. It is the reason that individuals with certain forms of blindness do not entirely lose their circadian rhythm. Despite not receiving light cues due to their blindness, other phenomena act as their resetting triggers. Any signal that the brain uses for the purpose of clock resetting is termed a zeitgeber, from the German “time giver” or “synchronizer.” Thus, while light is the most reliable and thus the primary zeitgeber, there are many factors that can be used in addition to, or in the absence of, daylight.",
		"Can we sustain our standard of living in the same ecological space while consuming the resources of that space? This question is particularly relevant since we are living in an era of skyrocketing fuel costs and humans’ ever-growing carbon footprints. Some argue that we are already at a breaking point because we have nearly exhausted the Earth’s finite carrying capacity. However, it’s possible that innovations and cultural changes can expand Earth’s capacity. We are already seeing this as the world economies are increasingly looking at “green,” renewable industries like solar and hydrogen energy. Still, many believe we will eventually reach a point at which conflict with the finite nature of resources is inevitable. That means survival could ultimately depend on getting the human population below its carrying capacity. Otherwise, without population control, the demand for resources will eventually exceed an ecosystem’s ability to provide it.",
		"Earlier agricultural systems were integrated with and co-evolved with technologies, beliefs, myths and traditions as part of an integrated social system. Generally, people planted a variety of crops in different areas, in the hope of obtaining a reasonably stable food supply. These systems could only be maintained at low population levels, and were relatively non-destructive (but not always). More recently, agriculture has in many places lost its local character, and has become incorporated into the global economy. This has led to increased pressure on agricultural land for exchange commodities and export goods. More land is being diverted from local food production to “cash crops” for export and exchange; fewer types of crops are raised, and each crop is raised in much greater quantities than before. Thus, ever more land is converted from forest (and other natural systems) for agriculture for export, rather than using land for subsistence crops.",
		"Lie detector tests base judgments of honesty on blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and vocal pitch, which the test assumes differ when people lie and when they tell the truth. However, lie detector tests have not proven particularly reliable. Now law enforcement has a new tool for detecting deception: the detail in stories told by people being questioned. New research indicates that when people lie, they develop a tight, bare­bones script and stick with it. They do not include details and comments on context because that just adds to what they have to remember. In contrast, when we tell a truthful story, we include 20% to 30% more detail. That is, people who are giving honest accounts tend to recall details about context―what was happening at the time of the event, who was present―that are not related to the main story. The researchers explain that “if you’re telling the truth, this mental reinstatement of contexts triggers more and more external details.”",
		"The essential oil, it has been said, is the heart and soul of a plant. It gives a plant its scent and may also drive away insects, attract bees and wasps for fertilization of the plant’s flowers, and protect the plant against decay, bacteria, and mold. Some of the same essential oil properties that serve plants in nature also provide health benefits to humans. Food manufacturers, for example, sometimes include essential oils in their products as a way of preventing bacterial growth. The oils are purer and more healthful than chemical antibacterial agents, such as chlorine. Many skincare products also make use of antibacterial essential oils. In nature, these oils protect plants against bacteria, and they do the same for us when rubbed on the skin.",
		"It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action. Whether it is losing weight, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to make some earthshaking improvement that everyone will talk about. Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable, but it can be far more meaningful in the long run. The difference this tiny improvement can make over time is surprising. Here’s how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty­seven times better by the time you’re done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor failure adds up to something much more.",
		"The most successful retirees are those who look at retirement as a long endeavor that can last 20 or 30 years or longer. They don’t throw all of their years of preparation away by investing in the next “hot stock” or investment idea. They’re very careful with their finances; they know they have to make sure that their money will last for the rest of their lives. They stay conservative and focused on a finish line that is years and years away. People who struggle in retirement are those who still have a “get rich quick” mentality. Even though they no longer have the comfort of a paycheck coming in, they still put their retirement nest egg at risk by chasing every hot tip that they get. In other words, they are looking for short cuts to bring them financial stability and peace of mind.",
		"The continued survival of the human race can be explained by our ability to adapt to our environment. While we may have lost some of our ancient ancestors’ survival skills, we have learned new skills as they have become necessary. Today, the gap between the skills we once had and the skills we now have grows ever wider as we rely more heavily on modern technology. Therefore, when you head off into the wilderness, it is important to fully prepare for the environment. Before a trip, research how the native inhabitants dress, work, and eat. How they have adapted to their way of life will help you to understand the environment and allow you to select the best gear and learn the correct skills.  This is crucial because most survival situations arise as a result of a series of events that could have been avoided.",
		"Over the past century, society has witnessed extraordinary advances in medicine, science, and technology. These advances came about because an individual, or many individuals, used the full resources of his or her intellectual imagination to solve problems that had previously been thought to be unsolvable. However, during the same period, there has been no comparable worldwide advance in ethical behavior. That is, in part, because human beings rarely use the full resources of their intellect to solve moral problems. Exercising moral imagination means using our intelligence to devise creative and innovative ways to help others. Concerning charity, for example, it means not only providing immediate assistance to the impoverished, but also helping the poor in ways that will enable them to support themselves and no longer need help. Therefore, in any situation in which help is required, we should use our intelligence to discover the most effective and loving way to help those in need.",
		"Sound and light travel in waves. An analogy often given for sound is that of throwing a small stone onto the surface of a still pond. Waves radiate outwards from the point of impact, just as sound waves radiate from the sound source. This is due to a disturbance in the air around us. If you bang two sticks together, you will get a sound. As the sticks approach each other, the air immediately in front of them is compressed and energy builds up. When the point of impact occurs, this energy is released as sound waves. If you try the same experiment with two heavy stones, exactly the same thing occurs, but you get a different sound due to the density and surface of the stones, and as they have likely displaced more air, a louder sound. And so, a physical disturbance in the atmosphere around us will produce a sound.",
		"Undoing a negative tie begins with giving up something of value rather than asking for a “fair trade.” If you give and then ask for something right away in return, you don’t establish a relationship; you carry out a transaction. When done correctly, reciprocity is like getting the pump ready. In the old days, pumps required lots of effort to produce any water. You had to repeatedly work a lever to eliminate a vacuum in the line before water could flow. But if you poured a small bucket of water into the line first, the empty space was quickly eliminated, enabling the water to flow with less effort. Reciprocity with a rival works in much the same way. Reflect carefully on what you should give and, ideally, choose something that requires little effort from the other party to reciprocate.",
		"Food chain means the transfer of food energy from the source in plants through a series of organisms with the repeated process of eating and being eaten. In a grassland, grass is eaten by rabbits while rabbits in turn are eaten by foxes. This is an example of a simple food chain. This food chain implies the sequence in which food energy is transferred from producer to consumer or higher trophic level. It has been observed that at each level of transfer, a large proportion, 80-90 percent, of the potential energy is lost as heat. Hence the number of steps or links in a sequence is restricted, usually to four or five. The shorter the food chain or the nearer the organism is to the beginning of the chain, the greater the available energy intake is.",
		"Unfortunately many organizations and political leaders working to improve environmental and social conditions operate unquestioningly from within the paradigm. However, to paraphrase Einstein, problems cannot be solved from within the same paradigm in which they were created. A good example is the cap and trade approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In this scenario, private companies are permitted to sell their “right” to pollute to other companies, which can then pollute more, in the belief that the free hand of the market will find the most efficient opportunities for greenhouse gas reductions. But viewing pollution as a “right” and relying on the market to solve environmental problems reinforces the very paradigm that got us into this mess. In a different paradigm, human health and ecological survival would be paramount, and industrial activities that undermine these goals would be prohibited outright. The right to clean air and a healthy climate would win over the right to pollute.",
		"Studies have consistently shown caffeine to be effective when used together with a pain reliever to treat headaches.  The positive correlation between caffeine intake and staying alert throughout the day has also been well established. As little as 60mg(the amount typically in one cup of tea) can lead to a faster reaction time. However, using caffeine to improve alertness and mental performance doesn’t replace getting a good night’s sleep. One study from 2018 showed that coffee improved reaction times in those with or without poor sleep, but caffeine seemed to increase errors in the group with little sleep. Additionally, this study showed that even with caffeine, the group with little sleep did not score as well as those with adequate sleep. It suggests that caffeine does not fully make up for inadequate sleep.",
		"In humans, body clocks are responsible for daily changes in blood pressure, body temperature, hormones, hunger, and thirst, as well as our sleep-wake cycles. These biological rhythms, which we experience as internal time, are probably older than sleep, developed over the course of millions of years of evolution. They facilitate physiological and behavioral changes on a roughly twenty-four-hour cycle no matter what is happening outside, whether a cold front moves in or clouds block the light of the sun. That is why people experience jet lag when traveling across time zones. Their internal clocks continue to run in accordance with the place they left behind, not the one to which they have come, and it can take some time to realign the two. The most remarkable thing is that our internal body clocks can be readjusted by environmental cues. We may get jet lag for a few days when we ask our body clocks to adapt to a vastly different schedule of day and night cycles on the other side of the Earth, but they can do it.",
		"Rewarding business success doesn’t always have to be done in a material way. A software company I once worked for had a great way of recognizing sales success. The sales director kept an air horn outside his office and would come out and blow the horn every time a salesperson settled a deal. The noise, of course, interrupted anything and everything happening in the office because it was unbelievably loud. However, it had an amazingly positive impact on everyone. Sometimes rewarding success can be as easy as that, especially when peer recognition is important. You should have seen the way the rest of the sales team wanted the air horn blown for them.",
		"The customer service representatives in an electronics firm under major restructuring were told they had to begin selling service contracts for their equipment in addition to installing and repairing them. This generated a great deal of resistance. To the service representatives, learning to sell was a very different game from what they had been playing. But it turned out they already knew a lot more about sales than they thought. For example, the first step in servicing or installing equipment is talking with the clients to understand how they used the equipment. The same is true in selling. The salesperson first has to learn about the customer’s needs. The service representatives also had a great deal of product knowledge and hands-on experience, which is obviously important in sales.",
		"Clouds are formed when moist air is carried upward by warm air currents rising from the earth’s surface during the day. When this air reaches high altitudes where the temperature and air pressure are lower than at the earth’s surface, the moisture comes out of the rising air and forms the water droplets we see as clouds. These clouds are very short­lived, though, and they usually disappear within minutes after they are formed as their water droplets mix with drier air and evaporate. Thus, during the daytime, clouds are continually being formed and then evaporated. At night, when the surface of the earth cools, the cloud­producing process cuts off. The existing clouds continue to evaporate, but they are not replaced by new ones. The result: cloudless skies in the morning.",
		"According to top nutrition experts, most nutrients are better absorbed and used by the body when consumed from a whole food instead of a supplement. However, many people feel the need to take pills, powders, and supplements in an attempt to obtain nutrients and fill the gaps in their diets. We hope these will give us more energy, prevent us from catching a cold in the winter, or improve our skin and hair. But in reality, the large majority of supplements are artificial and may not even be completely absorbed by your body. Worse, some are contaminated with other substances and contain ingredients not listed on the label. For example, a recent investigative report found heavy metals in 40 percent of 134 brands of protein powders on the market. With little control and regulation, taking supplements is a gamble and often costly.",
		"If you’re frustrated by the market and you’re looking for a currency that can stand the test of time, look no further. In the Caroline Islands in the South Pacific, there’s an island named Yap (or Uap). In 1903 an American anthropologist named Henry Furness III visited the islanders and found they had an unusual system of currency. It consisted of carved stone wheels called fei, ranging in diameter from a foot to 12 feet. Because the stones were heavy, the islanders didn’t normally carry their money around with them. After a transaction the fei might remain on a previous owner’s land, but it was understood who owned what. Furness was told one family’s fei had been lost at sea many years earlier while being transported from a nearby island during a storm. But that stone was still used as currency, even though it was unseen and irretrievable beneath hundreds of feet of water.",
		"In general, kinetic energy is the energy associated with motion, while potential energy represents the energy which is “stored” in a physical system. Moreover, the total energy is always conserved. But while the total energy remains unchanged, the kinetic and potential parts of the total energy can change all the time. Imagine, for example, a pendulum which swings back and forth. When it swings, it sweeps out an arc and then slows down as it comes closer to its highest point, where the pendulum does not move at all. So at this point, the energy is completely given in terms of potential energy. But after this brief moment of rest, the pendulum swings back again and therefore part of the total energy is then given in the form of kinetic energy. So as the pendulum swings, kinetic and potential energy constantly change into each other.",
		"Researchers have reported various nonverbal features of sarcasm. Most disagree as to whether nonverbal cues are essential to the perception of sarcasm or the emotion that prompts it. Even so, research confirms the finding that nonverbal cues are more credible than verbal cues, especially when verbal and nonverbal cues conflict. Also, nonverbal cues are better indicators of speaker intent. As the nature of sarcasm implies a contradiction between intent and message, nonverbal cues may “leak” and reveal the speaker’s true mood as they do in deception. Ostensibly, sarcasm is the opposite of deception in that a sarcastic speaker typically intends the receiver to recognize the sarcastic intent; whereas, in deception the speaker typically intends that the receiver not recognize the deceptive intent. Thus, when communicators are attempting to determine if a speaker is sarcastic, they compare the verbal and nonverbal message and if the two are in opposition, communicators may conclude that the speaker is being sarcastic.",
		"Our total set of values and their relative importance to us constitute our value system. The way that we behave in a given situation is often influenced by how important one value is to us relative to others. For instance, deciding whether to spend Saturday afternoon relaxing with your family or exercising will be determined by the relative importance that you place on family versus health. You feel value conflict when you do something that is consistent with one value but inconsistent with another equally important value. This dynamic can be illustrated with the example of parents who place equal value on convenience and concern for the environment. They may experience value conflict if they buy disposable diapers for their babies. Consumers facing such decisions consider not only the product’s immediate consumption outcomes but also the product’s general effect on society, including how the manufacturer behaves (e.g., toward the environment).",
		"Since its debut in 2000, an American drama centered around crime scene investigation has become very popular. In 2002, it was the most watched show on American television, and by 2009 the worldwide audience was estimated to be more than 73 million. It isn’t, however, such a hit with police officers and district attorneys, who have criticized the series for presenting a highly misleading image of how crimes are solved. Their fears have been echoed by Monica Robbers, a criminologist, who found evidence that jurors have increasingly unrealistic expectations of forensic evidence. Bernard Knight, formerly one of Britain’s chief pathologists, agrees. Jurors today, he observes, expect clearer proof than forensic science is capable of delivering. And he attributes this trend directly to the influence of television crime dramas.",
		"When an ecosystem is biodiverse, wildlife have more opportunities to obtain food and shelter. Different species react and respond to changes in their environment differently. For example, imagine a forest with only one type of plant in it, which is the only source of food and habitat for the entire forest food web. Now, there is a sudden dry season and this plant dies. Plant­eating animals completely lose their food source and die out, and so do the animals that prey upon them. But, when there is biodiversity, the effects of a sudden change are not so dramatic. Different species of plants respond to the drought differently, and many can survive a dry season. Many animals have a variety of food sources and don’t just rely on one plant; now our forest ecosystem is no longer at the death!",
		"Rights, and in particular human rights, can be divided into two broad categories: negative rights and positive rights. Negative rights reflect the vital interests that human beings have in being free from outside interference. The rights guaranteed in the Bill of Rights―freedom of speech, assembly, religion, and so on―fall within this category, as do the rights to freedom from injury and to privacy. Correlating with these are duties that we all have not to interfere with others’ pursuit of these interests and activities. Positive rights reflect the vital interests that human beings have in receiving certain benefits. They are rights to have others provide us with certain goods, services, or opportunities. Today, positive rights often are taken to include the rights to education, medical care, equal job opportunity, comparable pay, and so on. Correlating with these are positive duties for appropriate parties to assist individuals in their pursuit of these interests.",
		"The movie industry is obviously affected by personal recommendations. Even though well over a billion dollars is spent every year on promoting new movies, people talking to people is what really counts. According to Marvin Antonowsky, head of marketing for Universal Pictures, “Word of mouth is like wildfire.” This point is well illustrated by the number of low­budget movies that have succeeded with little or no advertising―and by the number of big­budget flops.  Like the movies, book publishing is another industry where lots of money is traditionally spent on advertising but can’t begin to compete with the power of friends telling friends about their discoveries. Twenty­five years ago, The Road Less Traveled, by psychiatrist M. Scott Peck, was just another psychology/relationship book lying unnoticed on bookstore shelves. Then a few people read it, told their friends, and started a chain reaction that is still going on.  Today, there are well over two million copies in print.",
		"We are connected to the night sky in many ways. It has always inspired people to wonder and to imagine. Since the dawn of civilization, our ancestors created myths and told legendary stories about the night sky. Elements of those narratives became embedded in the social and cultural identities of many generations. On a practical level, the night sky helped past generations to keep track of time and create calendars—essential to developing societies as aids to farming and seasonal gathering. For many centuries, it also provided a useful navigation tool, vital for commerce and for exploring new worlds. Even in modern times, many people in remote areas of the planet observe the night sky for such practical purposes.",
		"Infrasound has the special characteristic of traveling well in the ground or water; in fact, the waves of an earthquake can be thought of as a form of infrasound. Because sound travels much faster in ground than in air, ground­borne vibrations, if perceived, can serve as an early warning system, arriving well before airborne sound from the same source arrives. Infrasound dissipates less rapidly in air, making it ideal for long­distance communication. Perception of infrasound, however, presents some specific problems. An object smaller than the distance between waves is a poor receiver for those waves. Thus, infrasonic receivers need to be large and tend to be found on the large animals able to generate infrasound. This is probably the reason that infrasonic communication is used by only a few animals, and the best understood infrasonic communication system is the African elephants’.",
		"Almost all of science is fitting models to data. Scientists— such as Galileo, Newton, and Mendel—designed experiments, made observations, and collected data. They then tried to extract knowledge by devising theories, that is, building models to explain the data they observed. They then used these theories to make predictions and if they didn’t work, they collected more data and revised the theories. This process of data collection and theory/model building continued until they got models that had enough explanation power. We are now at a point where this type of data analysis can no longer be done manually, because people who can do such analysis are rare. Furthermore, the amount of data is huge and manual analysis is not possible. There is thus a growing interest in computer programs that can analyze data and extract information automatically from them—in other words, learn.",
		"Friction is a force between two surfaces that are sliding, or trying to slide, across each other. For example, when you try to push a book along the floor, friction makes this difficult. Friction always works in the direction opposite to the direction in which the object is moving, or trying to move. So, friction always slows a moving object down. The amount of friction depends on the surface materials. The rougher the surface is, the more friction is produced. Friction also produces heat. For example, if you rub your hands together quickly, they will get warmer. Friction can be a useful force because it prevents our shoes slipping on the floor when we walk and stops car tires skidding on the road. When you walk, friction is caused between the tread on your shoes and the ground, acting to grip the ground and prevent sliding.",
		"Cooperative tendencies cannot evolve (biologically) unless they present a competitive advantage on the cooperators. Imagine, for example, two groups of herders, one cooperative and one not. The cooperative herders limit the sizes of their individual herds, and thus preserve their commons, which allows them to maintain a sustainable food supply. The members of the uncooperative group follow the logic of self-interest, adding more and more animals to their respective herds. Consequently, they use up their commons, leaving themselves with very little food. As a result, the first group, thanks to their cooperative tendencies, can take over. They can wait for the uncooperative herders to starve, or, if they are more enterprising, they can wage an unequal war of the well fed against the hungry. Once the cooperative group has taken over, they can raise even more animals, feed more children, and thus increase the proportion of cooperators in the next generation.",
		"Humans born without sight are not able to collect visual experiences, so they understand the world entirely through their other senses. As a result, people with blindness at birth develop an amazing ability to understand the world through the collection of experiences and memories that come from these non­visual senses. The dreams of a person who has been without sight since birth can be just as vivid and imaginative as those of someone with normal vision. They are unique, however, because their dreams are constructed from the non­visual experiences and memories they have collected. A person with normal vision will dream about a familiar friend using visual memories of shape, lighting, and colour. But, a blind person will associate the same friend with a unique combination of experiences from their non­visual senses that act to represent that friend. In other words, people blind at birth have similar overall dreaming experiences even though they do not dream in pictures.",
		"In mature markets, breakthroughs that lead to a major change in competitive positions and to the growth of the market are rare. Because of this, competition becomes a zero sum game in which one organization can only win at the expense of others. However, where the degree of competition is particularly intense a zero sum game can quickly become a negative sum game, in that everyone in the market is faced with additional costs. As an example of this, when one of the major high street banks in Britain tried to gain a competitive advantage by opening on Saturday mornings, it attracted a number of new customers who found the traditional Monday-Friday bank opening hours to be a constraint. However, faced with a loss of customers, the competition responded by opening on Saturdays as well. The net effect of this was that, although customers benefited, the banks lost out as their costs increased but the total number of customers stayed the same. In essence, this proved to be a negative sum game.",
		"In fiber processing the word ‘spinning’ means two quite different things. One is the formation of individual fibers by squeezing a liquid through one or more small openings in a nozzle called a spinneret and letting it harden. Spiders and silkworms have been spinning fibers in this way for millions of years, but chemists and engineers learned the procedure from them only about a century ago. In the other kind of spinning―sometimes called throwing to prevent confusion with the first kind―two or more fibers are twisted together to form a thread. Human beings discovered this art thousands of years ago, and they have invented several devices to make it easier and faster. The ancient distaff and spindle are examples that were replaced by the spinning wheel in the Middle Ages. Later came the spinning jenny, the water frame, and Crompton’s mule―spinning machines that became symbols of the Industrial Revolution. ",
		"Television is the number one leisure activity in the United States and Europe, consuming more than half of our free time.  We generally think of television as a way to relax, tune out, and escape from our troubles for a bit each day.  While this is true, there is increasing evidence that we are more motivated to tune in to our favorite shows and characters when we are feeling lonely or have a greater need for social connection. Television watching does satisfy these social needs to some extent, at least in the short run. Unfortunately, it is also likely to “crowd out” other activities that produce more sustainable social contributions to our social well­being. The more television we watch, the less likely we are to volunteer our time or to spend time with people in our social networks. In other words, the more time we make for Friends, the less time we have for friends in real life.",
		"We often associate the concept of temperature with how hot or cold an object feels when we touch it. In this way, our senses provide us with a qualitative indication of temperature.  Our senses, however, are unreliable and often mislead us. For example, if you stand in bare feet with one foot on carpet and the other on a tile floor, the tile feels colder than the carpet even though both are at the same temperature.  The two objects feel different because tile transfers energy by heat at a higher rate than carpet does. Your skin “measures” the rate of energy transfer by heat rather than the actual temperature. What we need is a reliable and reproducible method for measuring the relative hotness or coldness of objects rather than the rate of energy transfer. Scientists have developed a variety of thermometers for making such quantitative measurements.",
		"Any gene exerts its maximum effect on bodies at some particular stage of life, and lethals and semilethals are not exceptions. Most genes exert their influence during foetal life, others during childhood, others during young adulthood, others in middle age, and yet others in old age. Obviously lethal genes will tend to be removed from the gene pool. But equally evidently a late­acting lethal will be more stable in the gene pool than an early­acting lethal. A gene that is lethal in an older body may still be successful in the gene pool, provided its lethal effect does not show itself until after the body has had time to do at least some reproducing. For instance, a gene that made old bodies develop cancer could be passed on to numerous offspring because the individuals would reproduce before they got cancer. On the other hand, a gene that made young adult bodies develop cancer would not be passed on to very many offspring, and a gene that made young children develop fatal cancer would not be passed on to any offspring at all. ",
		"Should we use language to understand mind or mind to understand language? Analytic philosophy historically assumes that language is basic and that mind would make sense if proper use of language was appreciated. Modern cognitive science, however, rightly judges that language is just one aspect of mind of great importance in human beings but not fundamental to all kinds of thinking. Countless species of animals manage to navigate the world, solve problems, and learn without using language, through brain mechanisms that are largely preserved in the minds of humans. There is no reason to assume that language is fundamental to mental operations. Nevertheless, language is enormously important in human life and contributes largely to our ability to cooperate with each other in dealing with the world. Our species homo sapiens has been astonishingly successful, which depended in part on language, first as an effective contributor to collaborative problem solving and much later, as collective memory through written records.",
		"Attitudes to measuring in the kitchen tend to be polarized. On the one hand, there are creative spirits who claim that they never weigh or measure anything. If you ask for a recipe from such a person, you will be told airily, “Oh, I never look at a cookbook”; if they do consult recipes, they happily play fast and loose with quantities. Every meal they cook is pure invention, pure instinct: cooking is an art and cannot be reduced to numbers. At the opposite end of the spectrum are those who want to assign an exact figure to everything. They view recipes as strict formulas, not to be changed. If a recipe calls for 325ml double cream and a carton contains only 300ml, then such people will anxiously buy a second carton to make up the shortfall. People in this group are more likely to think that what they are doing is scientific, the idea being that the more we can measure and pin cooking down, the more like science it will be.",
		"Take two glasses of water. Put a little bit of orange juice into one and a little bit of lemon juice into the other. What you have are essentially two glasses of water but with a completely different chemical makeup. If we take the glass containing orange juice and heat it, we will still have two different glasses of water with different chemical makeups, but now they will also have different temperatures. If we could magically remove the glasses, we would find the two water bodies would not mix well. Perhaps they would mix a little where they met; however, they would remain separate because of their different chemical makeups and temperatures. The warmer water would float on the surface of the cold water because of its lighter weight. In the ocean we have bodies of water that differ in temperature and salt content; for this reason, they do not mix.",
		"The one area in which the Internet could be considered an aid to thinking is the rapid acquisition of new information. But this is more fictional than real. Yes, the simple act of typing a few words into a search engine will virtually instantaneously produce links related to the topic at hand. But the examination of the accuracy of information obtained in this manner is not a simple matter. What one often gets is no more than abstract summaries of lengthy articles. As a consequence, I suspect that the number of downloads of any given scientific paper has little relevance to the number of times the entire article has been read from beginning to end. My advice is that if you want to do some serious thinking, then you’d better disconnect the Internet, phone, and television set and try spending twenty-four hours in absolute solitude.",
		"All carbohydrates are basically sugars. Complex carbohydrates are the good carbohydrates for your body. These complex sugar compounds are very difficult to break down and can trap other nutrients like vitamins and minerals in their chains. As they slowly break down, the other nutrients are also released into your body, and can provide you with fuel for a number of hours. Bad carbohydrates, on the other hand, are simple sugars. Because their structure is not complex, they are easy to break down and hold few nutrients for your body other than the sugars from which they are made. Your body breaks down these carbohydrates rather quickly and what it cannot use is converted to fat and stored in the body.",
		"There are many instances of rapid work on the part of the great composers; and their facility and quickness of composition causes great wonder and admiration. But our admiration is often misdirected. When we hear of some of the speedy writing of great works by Mozart or Mendelssohn, we might think that this speed was of the composing power as well as of pen, but, in fact, such was seldom the case. These great musicians generally did their composition mentally without reference to pen or piano, and simply postponed the unpleasant manual labor of committing their music to paper until it became absolutely necessary. Then they got credit for incredible rapidity of composition. But it is no light matter to quickly and correctly pen a long and complicated composition. One has only to copy a piece of music or to try to put into notes some piece of music previously memorized, to realize this.",
		"People commonly make the mistaken assumption that because a person has one type of characteristic, then they automatically have other characteristics which go with it. In one study, university students were given descriptions of a guest lecturer before he spoke to the group. Half the students received a description containing the word ‘warm’, the other half were told the speaker was ‘cold’. The guest lecturer then led a discussion, after which the students were asked to give their impressions of him. As expected, there were large differences between the impressions formed by the students, depending upon their original information of the lecturer. It was also found that those students who expected the lecturer to be warm tended to interact with him more. This shows that different expectations not only affect the impressions we form but also our behaviour and the relationship which is formed.",
		"Sometimes the pace of change is far slower. The face you saw reflected in your mirror this morning probably appeared no different from the face you saw the day before ―or a week or a month ago. Yet we know that the face that stares back at us from the glass is not the same, cannot be the same, as it was 10 minutes ago. The proof is in your photo album: Look at a photograph taken of yourself 5 or 10 years ago and you see clear differences between the face in the snapshot and the face in your mirror. If you lived in a world without mirrors for a year and then saw your reflection, you might be surprised by the change. After an interval of 10 years without seeing yourself, you might not at first recognize the person peering from the mirror. Even something as basic as our own face changes from moment to moment.",
		"According to Johann Herbart, a German philosopher, ideas form as information from the senses combines. The term he used for ideas—Vorsfellung—encompasses thoughts, mental images, and even emotional states. These make up the entire content of the mind, and Herbart saw them not as static but dynamic elements, able to move and interact with one another. Ideas, he said, can attract and combine with other ideas or feelings, or repulse them, rather like magnets. Similar ideas, such as a color and tone, attract each other and combine to form a more complex idea. However, if two ideas are unalike, they may continue to exist without association. This causes them to weaken over time, so that they eventually sink below the “threshold of consciousness.” Should two ideas directly contradict one another, “resistance occurs” and “concepts become forces when they resist one another.” They repel one another with an energy that propels one of them beyond consciousness, into a place that Herbart referred to as “a state of tendency”; and we now know as “the unconscious.”",
		"According to educational psychologist Susan Engel, curiosity begins to decrease as young as four years old. By the time we are adults, we have fewer questions and more default settings. As Henry James put it, “Disinterested curiosity is past, the mental grooves and channels set.” The decline in curiosity can be traced in the development of the brain through childhood. Though smaller than the adult brain, the infant brain contains millions more neural connections. The wiring, however, is a mess; the lines of communication between infant neurons are far less efficient than between those in the adult brain. The baby’s perception of the world is consequently both intensely rich and wildly disordered. As children absorb more evidence from the world around them, certain possibilities become much more likely and more useful and harden into knowledge or beliefs. The neural pathways that enable those beliefs become faster and more automatic, while the ones that the child doesn’t use regularly are pruned away.",
		"The wheel has been around five thousand years, more or less, so archaeologists tell us. Someone of our forefathers early on noticed that a round log was easier to roll than to carry. The next step was to figure out that heavy objects could be moved by rolling them on three logs, keeping two logs under the load and shifting the log that rolled out the back up to the front. In order to lighten the weight of the logs to be shifted, some inventive soul cut two cross sections out of a log and put a pole through the middle of both, making a wheel and axle. The next step was to fit a platform on the axle in such a way that the axle stayed in one place and the wheels turned round and round. This ancient inventor had thus invented the wagon that five thousand years later became a modern car. The wheel business began, speculatively, in Mesopotamia and from there spread to the rest of the Old World—Europe, Africa, and Asia.",
		"Boundaries between work and home are blurring as portable digital technology makes it increasingly possible to work anywhere, anytime. Individuals differ in how they like to manage their time to meet work and outside responsibilities.  Some people prefer to separate or segment roles so that boundary crossings are minimized. For example, these people might keep separate email accounts for work and family and try to conduct work at the workplace and take care of family matters only during breaks and non­work time.  We’ve even noticed more of these “segmenters” carrying two phones―one for work and one for personal use. Flexible schedules work well for these individuals because they enable greater distinction between time at work and time in other roles. Other individuals prefer integrating work and family roles all day long. This might entail constantly trading text messages with children from the office, or monitoring emails at home and on vacation, rather than returning to work to find hundreds of messages in their inbox.",
		"Recovering from a series of early failures, Edison regained his reputation as a great inventor, and electric wiring in the home gained wide acceptance. It wasn’t that people necessarily became less fearful of electricity, but rather, as they became more familiar with it, they began to believe that the risks could be managed with some safety precautions. People began to accept the trade­off of the risk of accidental death from electricity for better and cheaper lighting and work­saving electrical appliances. They simultaneously experienced a lower risk of candle and gaslight fires. They even ignored a dying gaslight industry’s warning to its few remaining customers that electric light projected a toxic ray that would turn their skin green and increase their death rate. This made­up claim was seen by the public as the scare tactic that it was, and they were unmoved. Gas lighting in homes soon disappeared, and the death rate from house fires decreased accordingly.",
		"A “complementary good” is a product that is often consumed alongside another product. For example, popcorn is a complementary good to a movie, while a travel pillow is a complementary good for a long plane journey. When the popularity of one product increases, the sales of its complementary good also increase. By producing goods that complement other products that are already (or about to be) popular, you can ensure a steady stream of demand for your product. Some products enjoy perfect complementary status—they have to be consumed together, such as a lamp and a lightbulb. However, do not assume that a product is perfectly complementary, as customers may not be completely locked in to the product. For example, although motorists may seem required to purchase gasoline to run their cars, they can switch to electric cars.",
		"In today’s digital environment, appearing in the mainstream news is still an important way citizens can communicate with a broader community about events and issues. Journalists can provide credibility, status, and a guaranteed large audience that many citizens do not feel they can get any other way. However, to access those benefits, subjects must yield control to journalists over how their stories are told to the public. That is a big risk, since news stories have a great deal of credibility with their audiences: whether subjects themselves feel the news coverage is accurate or not, they will have to deal with the consequences of many people believing it. If news coverage portrays them as socially deviant or otherwise morally unfit, the resulting stigma can be profound and enduring. And yet for many potential subjects, cooperating with journalists is still a bargain worth striking. The benefits of addressing, or simply displaying oneself to, a large news audience can be so great that many subjects conclude they are worth the risks of being misrepresented.",
		"The decline in the diversity of our food is an entirely human-made process. The biggest loss of crop diversity came in the decades that followed the Second World War. In an attempt to save millions from extreme hunger, crop scientists found ways to produce grains such as rice and wheat on an enormous scale. And thousands of traditional varieties were replaced by a small number of new super-productive ones.  The strategy worked spectacularly well, at least to begin with. Because of it, grain production tripled, and between 1970 and 2020 the human population more than doubled. Leaving the contribution of that strategy to one side, the danger of creating more uniform crops is that they are more at risk when it comes to disasters. Specifically, a global food system that depends on just a narrow selection of plants has a greater chance of not being able to survive diseases, pests and climate extremes.",
		"Urbanization has been taking place since the Neolithic Revolution, when agriculture enabled food surpluses to create a division of labor in settlements. The unlocking of human ingenuity to work on technology, trade, and urban culture has created ever-expanding opportunities in cities. However, while some cities took advantage of these new opportunities, many remained little more than rural trading posts. Urban opportunities accelerated with the Industrial Revolution and more recently with the globalization of the economy. But again, not every city has taken advantage of these opportunities. Some cities, such as Liverpool, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh, have struggled to adapt to the new opportunities and have relied for too long on outmoded methods of industrial production. Yet other cities, such as Manchester and New York, have made the transition and are thriving.",
		"Between 1940 and 2000, Cuba ruled the world baseball scene. They won 25 of the first 28 World Cups and 3 of 5 Olympic Games. The Cubans were known for wearing uniforms covered in red from head to toe, a strong contrast to the more conservative North American style featuring grey or white pants. Not only were their athletic talents superior, the Cubans appeared even stronger from just the colour of their uniforms. A game would not even start and the opposing team would already be scared. A few years ago, Cuba altered that uniform style, modernizing it and perhaps conforming to other countries’ style; interestingly, the national team has declined since that time. The country that ruled international baseball for decades has not been on top since that uniform change. Traditions are important for a team; while a team brand or image can adjust to keep up with present times, if it abandons or neglects its roots, negative effects can surface.",
		"Since the 1970s, more and more Maasai have given up the traditional life of mobile herding and now dwell in permanent huts. This trend was started by government policies that encouraged subdivision of commonly held lands. In the 1960s, conventional conservation wisdom held that the Maasai’s roaming herds were overstocked, degrading the range and Amboseli’s fever-tree woodlands. Settled, commercial ranching, it was thought, would be far more efficient. The Maasai rejected the idea at first—they knew they could not survive dry seasons without moving their herds to follow the availability of water and fresh grass. The Maasai, however, are a small minority, and their communally held lands have often been taken by outsiders. As East Africa’s human population grows, Maasai people are subdividing their lands and settling down, for fear of otherwise losing everything.",
		"The tongue was mapped into separate areas where certain tastes were registered: sweetness at the tip, sourness on the sides, and bitterness at the back of the mouth. Research in the 1980s and 1990s, however, demonstrated that the “tongue map” explanation of how we taste was, in fact, totally wrong. As it turns out, the map was a misinterpretation and mistranslation of research conducted in Germany at the turn of the twentieth century. Today, leading taste researchers believe that taste buds are not grouped according to specialty. Sweetness, saltiness, bitterness, and sourness can be tasted everywhere in the mouth, although they may be perceived at a little different intensities at different sites. Moreover, the mechanism at work is not place, but time. It’s not that you taste sweetness at the tip of your tongue, but rather that you register that perception first.",
		"No two animals are alike. Animals from the same litter will display some of the same features, but will not be exactly the same as each other; therefore, they may not respond in entirely the same way during a healing session. Environmental factors can also determine how the animal will respond during the treatment. For instance, a cat in a rescue center will respond very differently than a cat within a domestic home environment. In addition, animals that experience healing for physical illness will react differently than those accepting healing for emotional confusion. With this in mind, every healing session needs to be explored differently, and each healing treatment should be adjusted to suit the specific needs of the animal. You will learn as you go; healing is a constant learning process.",
		"Tourism takes place simultaneously in the realm of the imagination and that of the physical world. In contrast to literature or film, it leads to ‘real’, tangible worlds, while nevertheless remaining tied to the sphere of fantasies, dreams, wishes―and myth. It thereby allows the ritual enactment of mythological ideas. There is a considerable difference as to whether people watch a film about the Himalayas on television and become excited by the ‘untouched nature’ of the majestic mountain peaks, or whether they get up and go on a trek to Nepal. Even in the latter case, they remain, at least partly, in an imaginary world. They experience moments that they have already seen at home in books, brochures and films. Their notions of untouched nature and friendly, innocent indigenous people will probably be confirmed. But now this confirmation is anchored in a physical experience. The myth is thus transmitted in a much more powerful way than by television, movies or books.",
		"Humans can tell lies with their faces. Although some are specifically trained to detect lies from facial expressions, the average person is often misled into believing false and manipulated facial emotions. One reason for this is that we are “two-faced.” By this I mean that we have two different neural systems that manipulate our facial muscles. One neural system is under voluntary control and the other works under involuntary control. There are reported cases of individuals who have damaged the neural system that controls voluntary expressions. They still have facial expressions, but are incapable of producing deceitful ones. The emotion that you see is the emotion they are feeling, since they have lost the needed voluntary control to produce false facial expressions. There are also clinical cases that show the flip side of this coin. These people have injured the system that controls their involuntary expressions, so that the only changes in their demeanor you will see are actually willed expressions.",
		"What was it that prompted scientists to become interested in the way we treat animals? Before the Second World War, agricultural operations in the Western world consisted of traditional family­run farms. These were small scale and were typically dependent on manual labour to work the land and tend the animals. There was a general view within society that the farmers cared for their livestock because they were closely tied to the farmers’ livelihood. At the end of the War, however, a transition began that replaced old­style farming with production systems that were much more intensive. Animals that had previously spent large parts of the year outdoors were now confined to indoor facilities. By keeping livestock in windowless sheds and using artificial lighting and temperature control, growing seasons could be prolonged and it became possible to produce greater quantities of meat, milk, and eggs. The human contact with individual animals, however, was lost.",
		"Writing, like so many inventions, came about by accident, and this one happened on the back of an envelope. About 6,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, a group of people known as the Sumerians invented a new way of keeping track of trade. They made clay tokens shaped like animals, jars, and other goods, and recorded deals by wrapping the tokens up in clay envelopes. Once they’d sealed an envelope, they could no longer see what was inside it. So, using a pointed stick, they marked the soft clay with signs that showed its contents. It didn’t take them long to realize that, once they’d done this, they didn’t need the tokens any more: just the marked envelope would do. So by about 3100 BC, the envelopes had turned into simple squares of clay recording trade deals in symbols.",
		"Both the budget deficit and federal debt have soared during the recent financial crisis and recession. During 2009－2010, nearly 40 percent of federal expenditures were financed by borrowing. The huge recent federal deficits have pushed the federal debt to levels not seen since the years immediately following World War II. The rapid growth of baby-boomer retirees in the decade immediately ahead will mean higher spending levels and larger and larger deficits for both Social Security and Medicare. Moreover, more than half of Americans age 18 and older derive benefits from various transfer programs, while paying little or no personal income tax. All of these factors are going to make it extremely difficult to slow the growth of federal spending and keep the debt from ballooning out of control. Projections indicate that the net federal debt will rise to 90 percent of GDP by 2019, and many believe it will be even higher unless constructive action is taken soon.",
		"Erikson believes that when we reach the adult years, several physical, social, and psychological stimuli trigger a sense of generativity. A central component of this attitude is the desire to care for others. For the majority of people, parenthood is perhaps the most obvious and convenient opportunity to fulfill this desire. Erikson believes that another distinguishing feature of adulthood is the emergence of an inborn desire to teach. We become aware of this desire when the event of being physically capable of reproducing is joined with the events of participating in a committed relationship, the establishment of an adult pattern of living, and the assumption of job responsibilities. According to Erikson, by becoming parents we learn that we have the need to be needed by others who depend on our knowledge, protection, and guidance. We become entrusted to teach culturally appropriate behaviors, values, attitudes, skills, and information about the world. By assuming the responsibilities of being primary caregivers to children through their long years of physical and social growth, we concretely express what Erikson believes to be an inborn desire to teach.",
		"Do you think a computer is smarter than people? In the case of chess, it has been proven that a computer can store and handle more bits of information about chess moves than a human brain can.  But being good at chess isn’t a real measure of “intelligence.\" In fact, there are other board games that computers are pretty hopeless at.  For instance, in the complex board game Go, even the most advanced computers can’t beat beginners. The same goes for complex card games like poker, which computers are not good at because they can’t bluff (or even cheat) the way human players do.To play poker or Go well, you need other things like intuition and creativity.",
		"From the chemical point of view magma is an extremely complex system. The chemical composition of magma does not remain constant over time but varies in response to variations in the environment in which it is located. In contact with colder rocks, magma loses heat. This change in temperature causes certain minerals to begin to crystallize, depriving the magma of those chemical components that are involved in the formation of the crystals while at the same time enriching the magma with other components that are not involved in the formation of the crystals. Aside from heat, magma also exchanges chemical components with the surrounding rock, modifying both the composition of the magma and the surrounding rock. Portions of rock can be incorporated into the magma, becoming molten or remaining as solid fragments within it. In response to variations in chemical composition, temperature and most of all pressure, volatile substances contained in the magma like water or carbon dioxide can be released to form gas bubbles, producing great changes in the properties of the magma and in many cases leading to an eruption.",
		"Rome left an enduring legacy in many areas and multiple ways. However, one of its clearest bequests was its influence over the development of law. There is a saying attributed to Goethe according to which Roman law was like a diving duck. It could be swimming on the surface or diving deep in the water, but whether you saw it or not, it was always there. This belief in the persistence of Roman law throughout European history was not unique to Goethe or the nineteenth century in which he lived. It is currently shared by most historians, who usually begin the story of the development of law in Europe with Roman law. Of course, Romans were not the first people to have a normative system, and, like all other societies, they constantly borrowed from neighboring societies, most particularly from the Hellenistic world. It is also clear that Roman law evolved dramatically over time, continuously adapting to new circumstances and challenges.",
		"It is a common assumption that most vagrant birds are ultimately doomed, aside from the rare cases where individuals are able to reorientate and return to their normal ranges. In turn, it is also commonly assumed that vagrancy itself is a relatively unimportant biological phenomenon. This is undoubtedly true for the majority of cases, as the most likely outcome of any given vagrancy event is that the individual will fail to find enough resources, and/or be exposed to inhospitable environmental conditions, and perish. However, there are many lines of evidence to suggest that vagrancy can, on rare occasions, dramatically alter the fate of populations, species or even whole ecosystems. Despite being infrequent, these events can be extremely important when viewed at the timescales over which ecological and evolutionary processes unfold. The most profound consequences of vagrancy relate to the establishment of new breeding sites, new migration routes and wintering locations. Each of these can occur through different mechanisms, and at different frequencies, and they each have their own unique importance.",
		"For centuries, people looked to the oceans as an unlimited source of food supply.Though, 76 percent of the world’s fisheries have recently suffered from thoughtless exploitation and over­fishing. Each year billions of unwanted fish and other animals die from these inefficient, illegal, and destructive fishing practices How can we save such precious resources?  We can do it by consuming seafood in moderation and choosing only seafood that comes from sustainable fisheries.Now several guides are available that let you know what types of seafood you can eat or should avoid due to the declining populations in the wild. Your choice as a consumer could possibly encourage more fisheries to change their practices to make way for healthier oceans.",
		"The ancient Greek historian Aeneas the Tactician suggested conveying a secret message by pricking tiny holes under particular letters in an apparently ordinary page of text. Those letters would spell out a secret message, easily read by the intended receiver. However, any other person who stared at the page would probably be unaware of pinpricks and thus the secret message. Two thousand years later, British letter writers used exactly the same method, not to achieve secrecy but to avoid paying excessive postage costs. Before the establishment of the postage system in the mid­1800s, sending a letter cost about a shilling for every hundred miles, beyond the means of most people. However, newspapers could be posted free of charge, and this provided a loophole for thrifty Victorians. Instead of writing and sending letters, people began to use pinpricks to spell out a message on the front page of a newspaper. They could then send the newspaper through the post without having to pay a penny.",
		"Intuition can be great, but it ought to be hard­earned. Experts, for example, are able to think on their feet because they’ve invested thousands of hours in learning and practice: their intuition has become data­driven. Only then are they able to act quickly in accordance with their internalized expertise and evidence­based experience. Yet most people are not experts, though they often think they are. Most of us, especially when we interact with others on social media, act with expert­like speed and conviction, offering a wide range of opinions on global crises, without the substance of knowledge that supports it. And thanks to AI, which ensures that our messages are delivered to an audience more inclined to believing it, our delusions of expertise can be reinforced by our personal filter bubble. We have an interesting tendency to find people more open­minded, rational, and sensible when they think just like us.",
		"Many behaviors alter or change the environment through physical actions intended to achieve a desired result. For example, a hungry child might walk toward the refrigerator and open it to obtain an apple. The child’s behavior directly changes the environment in order to achieve the ultimate consequence (obtaining an apple). What if, instead of walking over and opening the refrigerator, the child simply says, “I want an apple,” and his mother hands him an apple? In this case, the first effect made is on the behavior of another person. The child has acted indirectly upon the environment, from which the ultimate consequence of his behavior (the apple) emerges. This child engaged in a behavior of producing a certain pattern of sounds that resulted in his mother bringing him an apple. The apple reached the child as a result of a complex series of events that included the behavior of both the speaker and the listener.",
		"You don’t worry because you care; you worry because that is what you have learned to do. Worry is a very creative mental process. The questions you ask in your mind create your worries. If you ask ‘what if’ questions, you set your mind up to worry. You may consistently ask, “What if I lose my job? What if I crash my car? What if criminals attack me?” All these ‘what if’ phrases create ‘movies’ in your mind that constantly repeat different scenarios, which creates a state of worry. Rather, say to yourself, “What would I do if I lost my job? What would I do if I crashed my car?” The movies that are created by these questions don’t trap you into worry. They give you action steps that direct your mind. Create a procedure for different scenarios and make peace with your thinking.",
		"The reality of life on our planet is that productive resources are limited, while the human desire for goods and services is virtually unlimited.Would you like to have some new clothes, a luxury boat, or a vacation in the Swiss Alps?You may dream of driving a brand­new car into the driveway of your oceanfront house.  Most of us would like to have all of these things and many others. However, we are constrained by the scarcity of resources, including a limited availability of time.Because we cannot have as much of everything as we would like, we are forced to choose among alternatives.There is no free lunch: doing one thing makes us sacrifice other opportunities.",
		"Introverted leaders do have to overcome the strong cultural presumption that extroverts are more effective leaders. Although the population splits into almost equal parts between introverts and extroverts, more than 96 percent of managers and executives are extroverted. In a study done in 2006, 65 percent of senior corporate executives viewed introversion as a barrier to leadership. We must reexamine this stereotype, however, as it doesn’t always hold true. Regent University found that a desire to be of service to others and to empower them to grow, which is more common among introverts than extroverts, is a key factor in becoming a leader and retaining leadership. So-called servant leadership, dating back to ancient philosophical literature, adheres to the belief that a company’s goals are best achieved by helping workers or customers achieve their goals. Such leaders do not seek attention but rather want to shine a light on others’ wins and achievements; servant leadership requires humility, but that humility ultimately pays off.",
		"Children are born theorizers. Their minds are never idle and, once they start talking, their mouths aren’t, either. When their use of a word strikes us as odd, we correct them. They learn the meanings of words by trial and error, by hypothesizing a fit between word and object and using the feedback they get from others to refine the abstract category for which the word stands. But of course, those others were once children themselves, and they learned language in the same way. It is obvious then that there is no authority external to the community of language speakers against whose prescriptions all usage could be checked. Rather, words acquire objective meanings because of the “pull” exerted by social pressures to conform to publicly approved usage. Therefore every category, every concept of ours is a work in progress. No two of us learn our language alike, and nobody finishes learning it while he lives.",
		"By the nineteenth century, France had developed a system of precisely defined units of measurement to capture space, time, and more, and had begun to get other nations to adopt the same standards. Just half a century later, in the 1920s, the discoveries of quantum mechanics forever destroyed the dream of comprehensive and perfect measurement. And yet, outside a relatively small circle of physicists, the mindset of humankind’s drive to flawlessly measure continued among engineers and scientists. In the world of business it even expanded, as the precision-oriented sciences of mathematics and statistics began to influence all areas of commerce. However, contrary to the trend of the past several decades, in many new situations that are occurring today, allowing for imprecision― for messiness―may be a positive feature, not a shortcoming. As a tradeoff for relaxing the standards of allowable errors, one can get a hold of much more data. It isn’t just that “more is better than some,” but that, in fact, sometimes “more is greater than better.”",
		"We seek out feel-good experiences, always on the lookout for the next holiday, purchase or culinary experience. This approach to happiness is relatively recent; it depends on our capacity both to pad our lives with material pleasures and to feel that we can control our suffering. Painkillers, as we know them today, are a relatively recent invention and access to material comfort is now within reach of a much larger proportion of the world’s population. These technological and economic advances have had significant cultural implications, leading us to see our negative experiences as a problem and maximizing our positive experiences as the answer. Yet, through this we have forgotten that being happy in life is not just about pleasure. Comfort, contentment and satisfaction have never been the elixir of happiness. Rather, happiness is often found in those moments we are most vulnerable, alone or in pain. Happiness is there, on the edges of these experiences, and when we get a glimpse of that kind of happiness it is powerful, transcendent and compelling.",
		"Whispering galleries are remarkable acoustic spaces found beneath certain domes or curved ceilings. A famous one is located outside a well-known restaurant in New York City’s Grand Central Station. It’s a fun place to take a date: the two of you can exchange romantic words while you’re forty feet apart and separated by a busy passageway. You’ll hear each other clearly, but the passersby won’t hear a word you’re saying. To produce this effect, the two of you should stand at diagonally opposite corners of the space, facing the wall. That puts you each near a focus, a special point at which the sound of your voice gets focused as it reflects off the passageway’s curved walls and ceiling. Ordinarily, the sound waves you produce travel in all directions and bounce off the walls at different times and places, scrambling them so much that they are inaudible when they arrive at the ear of a listener forty feet away. But when you whisper at a focus, the reflected waves all arrive at the same time at the other focus, thus reinforcing one another and allowing your words to be heard.",
		"The brain is a high­energy consumer of glucose, which is its fuel. Although the brain accounts for merely 3 percent of a person’s body weight, it consumes 20 percent of the available fuel. Your brain can’t store fuel, however, so it has to “pay as it goes.” Since your brain is incredibly adaptive, it economizes its fuel resources. Thus, during a period of high stress, it shifts away from the analysis of the nuances of a situation to a singular and fixed focus on the stressful situation at hand. You don’t sit back and speculate about the meaning of life when you are stressed. Instead, you devote all your energy to trying to figure out what action to take. Sometimes, however, this shift from the higher­thinking parts of the brain to the automatic and reflexive parts of the brain can lead you to do something too quickly, without thinking.",
		"Most of the key positions in the keyboard layout on computers today are the result of the design of the keys for the typewriter.The early typewriter characters were positioned at the end of a long piece of metal and struck the paper through a ribbon when the user pressed the key on the keyboard. When the typist typed too fast, the keys would get caught on each other.Therefore, the keyboard design strategy was to position the most frequently used keys as far apart as possible to minimize the possibility that the keys would stick together.That design makes no sense for the computer keyboard since there are no mechanical arms striking anything, only electronic signals.However, the early designers of computers determined that adhering to current keyboard layouts would make typists more comfortable with the computer.The result is a keyboard layout that maximizes finger movement instead of minimizing it.",
		"Much research has been carried out on the causes of engagement, an issue that is important from both a theoretical and practical standpoint: identifying the drivers of work engagement may enable us to manipulate or influence it. The causes of engagement fall into two major camps: situational and personal. The most influential situational causes are job resources, feedback and leadership, the latter, of course, being responsible for job resources and feedback. Indeed, leaders influence engagement by giving their employees honest and constructive feedback on their performance, and by providing them with the necessary resources that enable them to perform their job well. It is, however, noteworthy that although engagement drives job performance, job performance also drives engagement. In other words, when employees are able to do their jobs well—to the point that they match or exceed their own expectations and ambitions—they will engage more, be proud of their achievements, and find work more meaningful.  This is especially evident when people are employed in jobs that align with their values.",
		"To say that the artist must have the cooperation of others for the art work to occur as it finally does does not mean that he cannot work without that cooperation. The art work, after all, need not occur as it does, but can take many other forms, including those which allow it to be done without others’ help. Thus, though poets do depend on printers and publishers, one can produce poetry without them. Russian poets whose work circulates in privately copied typescripts do that, as did Emily Dickinson. In both cases, the poetry does not circulate in conventional print because the artist would not accept the censorship or rewriting imposed by those who would publish the work. The poet either has to reproduce and circulate his work himself or not have it circulated. But he can still write poetry.",
		"Coevolution is the concept that two or more species of organisms can reciprocally influence the evolutionary direction of the other. In other words, organisms affect the evolution of other organisms. Since all organisms are influenced by other organisms, this is a common pattern. For example, grazing animals and the grasses they consume have coevolved. Grasses that are eaten by grazing animals grow from the base of the plant near the ground rather than from the tips of the branches as many plants do. Furthermore, grasses have hard materials in their cell walls that make it difficult for animals to crush the cell walls and digest them. Grazing animals have different kinds of adaptations that overcome these deterrents. Many grazers have teeth that are very long or grow continuously to compensate for the wear associated with grinding hard cell walls. Others, such as cattle, have complicated digestive tracts that allow microorganisms to do most of the work of digestion.",
		"During the Stone Age, our ancestor’s tools were made of flint, wood, and bone.Anyone who has ever tried to make anything with these kinds of tools knows how limiting they are: if you hit a piece of wood it either cracks or snaps.Metals are fundamentally different from these other materials because they can be hammered into shape. Not only that, they get stronger when you hit them; you can harden a blade just by hammering it. And you can reverse the process simply by putting metal in a fire and heating it up, which will cause it to get softer.The first people to discover these properties ten thousand years ago had found a material that was almost as hard as rock but behaved like a plastic and was almost infinitely reusable.In other words, they had discovered the perfect material for tools, and in particular cutting tools like axes and razors.",
		"The fundamental nature of the experimental method is manipulation and control. Scientists manipulate a variable of interest, and see if there’s a difference. At the same time, they attempt to control for the potential effects of all other variables. The importance of controlled experiments in identifying the underlying causes of events cannot be overstated. In the real­uncontrolled­world, variables are often correlated. For example, people who take vitamin supplements may have different eating and exercise habits than people who don’t take vitamins. As a result, if we want to study the health effects of vitamins, we can’t merely observe the real world, since any of these factors (the vitamins, diet, or exercise) may affect health. Rather, we have to create a situation that doesn’t actually occur in the real world. That’s just what scientific experiments do. They try to separate the naturally occurring relationship in the world by manipulating one specific variable at a time, while holding everything else constant.",
		"There is obviously a wide gap between the promises of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 and the real world of human-rights violations. In so far as we sympathize with the victims, we may criticize the UN and its member governments for failing to keep their promises. However, we cannot understand the gap between human-rights ideals and the real world of human-rights violations by sympathy or by legal analysis. Rather, it requires investigation by the various social sciences of the causes of social conflict and political oppression, and of the interaction between national and international politics. The UN introduced the concept of human rights into international law and politics. The field of international politics is, however, dominated by states and other powerful actors (such as multinational corporations) that have priorities other than human rights. It is a leading feature of the human-rights field that the governments of the world proclaim human rights but have a highly variable record of implementing them. We must understand why this is so.",
		"Philosophers have long argued about the process people use to understand one another. Some believe that we are careful theorizers.We come up with hypotheses about how other people will behave, and then test those hypotheses against the evidence we observe minute by minute.In this theory, people come across as rational scientists, constantly weighing evidence and testing explanations.And there’s clear evidence that this sort of hypothesis testing is part of how we understand one another.But these days most of the research supports the idea that we automatically simulate others, and understand what others feel by feeling what they are experiencing, in ourselves.In this view, people aren’t cold theorizers who are making judgments about other creatures.They are unconscious actors who understand by sharing or at least simulating the responses they see in the people around them.",
		"Why do people in the Mediterranean live longer and have a lower incidence of disease? Some people say it’s because of what they eat. Their diet is full of fresh fruits, fish, vegetables, whole grains, and nuts. Individuals in these cultures drink red wine and use great amounts of olive oil. Why is that food pattern healthy? One reason is that they are eating a palette of colors. More and more research is surfacing that shows us the benefits of the thousands of colorful “phytochemicals” (phyto=plant) that exist in foods. These healthful, non‑nutritive compounds in plants provide color and function to the plant and add to the health of the human body. Each color connects to a particular compound that serves a specific function in the body. For example, if you don’t eat purple foods, you are probably missing out on anthocyanins, important brain protection compounds. Similarly, if you avoid green‑colored foods, you may be lacking chlorophyll, a plant antioxidant that guards your cells from damage.",
		"Representational theories of art treat the work of the artist as similar to that of the scientist. Both, so to speak, are involved in describing the external world. But by the nineteenth century, any comparison between the scientist and the artist was bound to make the artist look like a poor relation in terms of making discoveries about the world or holding a mirror up to nature. Here, science clearly had the edge. So, there was a social pressure for art to come up with some vocation that both distinguished it from science and, at the same time, made it equal in stature to science. The notion that art specialized in the expression of the emotions was particularly attractive in this light. It rendered unto science its own―the exploration of the objective world―while saving something comparably important for art to do―to explore the inner world of feeling. If science held the mirror up to nature, art turned a mirror at the self and its experiences.",
		"Electric communication is mainly known in fish. The electric signals are produced in special electric organs. When the signal is discharged the electric organ will be negatively loaded compared to the head and an electric field is created around the fish. A weak electric current is created also in ordinary muscle cells when they contract. In the electric organ the muscle cells are connected in larger chunks, which makes the total current intensity larger than in ordinary muscles. The fish varies the signals by changing the form of the electric field or the frequency of discharging. The system is only working over small distances, about one to two meters.  This is an advantage since the species using the signal system often live in large groups with several other species. If many fish send out signals at the same time, the short range decreases the risk of interference.",
		"For decades, we have been measuring intelligence at the individual level, just as we have been measuring creativity, engagement, and grit. But it turns out we were failing to measure something with far greater impact. As reported in the journal Science, researchers from MIT, Union College, and Carnegie Mellon have finally found a method for systematically measuring the intelligence of a group as opposed to an individual. Just as we evaluate how successful an individual student will be at solving a problem, we are now able to predict how successful a group of people will be at solving a problem or problems. It would be easy to assume that if you put a group of high­IQ people together, naturally they would exhibit a high collective intelligence. But that’s not what happens. Indeed, their research found that a team on which each person was merely average in their individual abilities but possessed a collective intelligence would continually exhibit higher success rates than a team of individual geniuses.",
		"Even an extinct language can be brought back to life, if conditions are right. There must be people who want the language back. Also, there must be written or audio­recorded material of the language in some form.This has happened with an Aboriginal language of South Australia called Kaurna. Its last native speaker died in 1929, but in the 1980s a group of people decided that they wanted their language back. “The language isn’t dead,” the leader of the group said, “it’s only sleeping.” Fortunately, material survived from the nineteenth century, so that a linguist was able to make a fresh description and help the Kaurna people start learning the language again. It’s taught in schools now, and some day, perhaps, some children will start learning it as their mother tongue.",
		"There has been a huge rise in popularity of male grooming products. Men all over the world are spending billions of dollars on everything from cosmetics to plastic surgery. As to the reason for men’s grooming, experts say that men consider their appearance as an important factor for social success. Experts further searched the history of men’s grooming for such cases in various countries. Dying hair blond, for instance, was a common practice among ancient Roman men, as it was believed that blond hair provided a more youthful appearance. Similarly, ancient Egyptian men regularly shaved their body hair and applied various cosmetics to their skin. We could say appearance was important to men in the past and it certainly is to men in the present.",
		"Creativity can have an effect on productivity. Creativity leads some individuals to recognize problems that others do not see, but which may be very difficult. Charles Darwin’s approach to the speciation problem is a good example of this; he chose a very difficult and tangled problem, speciation, which led him into a long period of data collection and deliberation. This choice of problem did not allow for a quick attack or a simple experiment. In such cases creativity may actually decrease productivity (as measured by publication counts) because effort is focused on difficult problems. For others, whose creativity is more focused on methods and technique, creativity may lead to solutions that drastically reduce the work necessary to solve a problem. We can see an example in the development of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which enables us to amplify small pieces of DNA in a short time. This type of creativity might reduce the number of steps or substitute steps that are less likely to fail, thus increasing productivity.",
		"If there is any field that is associated with seeing rather than with hearing, it is science. Scholars who emphasize the visual bias in Western culture even point to science as their favorite example. Because doing research seems impossible without using images, graphs, and diagrams, science is―in their view―a visual endeavor par excellence. Historians and sociologists of science have recently corrected this claim by showing how senses other than seeing, including listening, have been significant in the development of knowledge, notable in the laboratory. They stress that scientific work involves more than visual observation. The introduction of measurement devices that merely seem to require the reading of results and thus seeing has not ruled out the deployment of the scientists’ other senses. On the contrary, scientific work in experimental settings often calls for bodily skills, one of which is listening. The world of science itself, however, still considers listening a less objective entrance into knowledge production than seeing.",
		"Attitudes toward technological progress are shaped by how people’s incomes are affected by it. Economists think about progress in terms of enabling and replacing technologies. The telescope, whose invention allowed astronomers to gaze at the moons of Jupiter, did not displace laborers in large numbers ─instead, it enabled us to perform new and previously unimaginable tasks. This contrasts with the arrival of the power loom, which replaced hand­loom weavers performing existing tasks and therefore prompted opposition as weavers found their incomes threatened. Thus, it stands to reason that when technologies take the form of capital that replaces workers, they are more likely to be resisted. The spread of every technology is a decision, and if some people stand to lose their jobs as a consequence, adoption will not be frictionless. Progress is not inevitable and for some it is not even desirable. Though it is often taken as a given, there is no fundamental reason why technological ingenuity should always be allowed to thrive.",
		"When researchers find that two variables are related, they often automatically leap to the conclusion that those two variables have a cause­and­effect relationship. For example, suppose a researcher found that people who took vitamin C every day reported having fewer colds than people who didn’t. Upon finding these results, she wrote a paper saying vitamin C prevents colds, using this data as evidence. Now, while it may be true that vitamin C does prevent colds, this researcher’s study can’t claim that. That’s because she didn’t control for any other factors that could be related to both vitamin C and colds. For example, people who take vitamin C every day may be more health­conscious overall, washing their hands more often and exercising more. Until you do a controlled experiment, you can’t make a cause­and­effect conclusion based on relationships you find. ",
		"The need for touch may seem like common sense.  However, in the early 1900s, people in Europe believed that touching newborns was not good for them and they thought that it would spread germs and make the babies weak and whiny.  In the orphanages at that time, it was not permitted to cuddle newborn babies. The babies were well fed and cared for, but many of them became ill. Then one doctor suggested that the babies be held several times daily.  The sick babies began to get better gradually. Recent research that has confirmed the importance of touch for babies encourages parents and nurses to touch and stroke premature babies as much as possible.",
		"Clarity is often a difficult thing for a leader to obtain. Concerns of the present tend to seem larger than potentially greater concerns that lie farther away. Some decisions by their nature present great complexity, whose many variables must come together a certain way for the leader to succeed. Compounding the difficulty, now more than ever, is what ergonomists call information overload, where a leader is overrun with inputs―via e-mails, meetings, and phone calls―that only distract and confuse her thinking. Alternatively, the leader’s information might be only fragmentary, which might cause her to fill in the gaps with assumptions―sometimes without recognizing them as such. And the merits of a leader’s most important decisions, by their nature, typically are not clear-cut. Instead those decisions involve a process of assigning weights to competing interests, and then determining, based upon some criterion, which one predominates. The result is one of judgment, of shades of gray; like saying that Beethoven is a better composer than Brahms.",
		"Fireflies don’t just light up their behinds to attract mates, they also glow to tell bats not to eat them. This twist in the tale of the trait that gives fireflies their name was discovered by Jesse Barber and his colleagues. The glow’s warning role benefits both fireflies and bats, because these insects taste disgusting to the mammals. When swallowed, chemicals released by fireflies cause bats to throw them back up. The team placed eight bats in a dark room with three or four fireflies plus three times as many tasty insects, including beetles and moths, for four days. During the first night, all the bats captured at least one firefly. But by the fourth night, most bats had learned to avoid fireflies and catch all the other prey instead. When the team painted fireflies’ light organs dark, a new set of bats took twice as long to learn to avoid them. It had long been thought that firefly bioluminescence mainly acted as a mating signal, but the new finding explains why firefly larvae also glow despite being immature for mating.",
		"The Irish overreliance on potatoes was worsened by certain economic trends in the early 19th century.The development of the British textile industry, for example, made the traditional handicraft sector useless, destroying a key mechanism for achieving food security for the Irish rural poor. A second negative trend was falling real wages and rising rents, which gradually reduced the relative standard of living of wage­dependent Irish. In desperation, many Irish farmers resorted to cultivating wetlands or rocky hillsides. But this unproductive land left such farmers at a chronic risk of starvation. Another sign of Irish poverty was the increased reliance of the poor on the “lumper” variety of potato, a watery, tasteless potato that nonetheless could produce impressive yields even on substandard soil.  Unfortunately this potato proved particularly vulnerable to the potato blight of 1845­52.",
		"In the natural world, if an animal consumes a plant with enough antinutrients to make it feel unwell, it won’t eat that plant again. Intuitively, animals also know to stay away from these plants. Years of evolution and information being passed down created this innate intelligence. This “intuition,” though, is not just seen in animals. Have you ever wondered why most children hate vegetables? Dr. Steven Gundry justifies this as part of our genetic programming, our inner intelligence. Since many vegetables are full of antinutrients, your body tries to keep you away from them while you are still fragile and in development. It does this by making your taste buds perceive these flavors as bad and even disgusting. As you grow and your body becomes stronger enough to tolerate these antinutrients, suddenly they no longer taste as bad as before.",
		"There are several broad differences in the way that liars and truth tellers discuss events. One difference is that liars say less overall than truth tellers. If you are telling the truth, the details of what happened are obvious. If you are lying, it is not easy to conjure up lots of details. Interestingly, truth tellers talk less about their emotions than liars do. That is because when you recall a real memory, you begin to reexperience some of the emotion from that event. As a result, that emotion feels obvious to you (and would be obvious to anyone watching you). If you are lying, though, you don’t really experience that emotion, so you describe it instead. Truth tellers also talk about themselves more than liars, because people telling the truth are more focused on their own memories than liars are (who are also thinking about how their story is being perceived by others).",
		"In the last twenty years or so research on the brain has radically changed the way intelligence is understood. There is now considerable controversy surrounding the notion of general intelligence. Some of our intelligence may indeed be inherited, but our life experience is now thought to have a profound effect upon intelligence. Scientists have suggested that intelligence changes and modifies as one progresses through life. This finding has not yet impacted on schooling in any significant way.  When asked to describe a class they had met for the first time, some teachers immediately divided the children into three groups, the bright, the middle­of­the­road and the “no hopers.” The old idea of innate intelligence has had a major effect on this categorizing and labelling of children. It has contributed to many children growing up with the mistaken idea that they are not intelligent and cannot succeed in education.",
		"The difference in the Moon’s gravitational pull on different parts of our planet effectively creates a “stretching force.” It makes our planet slightly stretched out along the line of sight to the Moon and slightly compressed along a line perpendicular to that. The tidal stretching caused by the Moon’s gravity affects our entire planet, including both land and water, inside and out. However, the rigidity of rock means that land rises and falls with the tides by a much smaller amount than water, which is why we notice only the ocean tides. The stretching also explains why there are generally two high tides (and two low tides) in the ocean each day. Because Earth is stretched much like a rubber band, the oceans bulge out both on the side facing toward the Moon and on the side facing away from the Moon. As Earth rotates, we are carried through both of these tidal bulges each day, so we have high tide when we are in each of the two bulges and low tide at the midpoints in between.",
		"Insurance companies are expected to err on the safe side. They calculate risks thoroughly, carefully picking and choosing the customers they insure. They are boring because their role in the economy is to shield everyone and everything from disastrous loss.  Unlike manufacturing, nothing truly revolutionary ever happens in the insurance industry. For centuries, insurers have charged higher premiums to people in “high­risk categories” such as smokers, male drivers under the age of thirty, and extreme­sports enthusiasts. This type of classification frequently results in biases and outright discrimination against disadvantaged groups.But in the future, real­time data collection will enable insurance companies to charge pay­as­you­drive rates depending on people’s actual behavior on the road, as opposed to generalized stereotypes of certain “at­risk” groups. Bad or high­risk individual drivers will end up paying more for insurance, regardless of whether they are men or women, young or old. The Big Brother connotations are threatening, but many people might agree to the real­time monitoring of their driving behavior if it means lower rates.",
		"Geographic expansion (which placed us in new environments) and cultural innovation both changed the selective pressures humans experienced. The payoff of many traits changed, and so did optimal life strategy. For example, when humans hunted big game 100,000 years ago, they relied on close­in attacks with thrusting spears. Such attacks were highly dangerous and physically demanding, so in those days, hunters had to be heavily muscled and have thick bones. That kind of body had its disadvantages―if nothing else, it required more food―but on the whole, it was the best solution in that situation. But new weapons like the atlatl (a spearthrower) and the bow effectively stored muscle­generated energy, which meant that hunters could kill big game without big biceps and robust skeletons. Once that happened, lightly built people, who were better runners and did not need as much food, became competitively superior. A heavy build was yesterday’s solution: expensive, but no longer necessary.",
		"Almost all the figurative paintings we are familiar with now are in perspective. They present foreshortened figures and objects that diminish as they move away from the focal point of the painting. A painting in perspective represents how the world looks to a person seeing the scene from a particular position in space. This stands in contrast to earlier figurative art, which had been as focused on representing what the artist knew about the objects and the space he or she was painting as on how they looked. These pictures are beautiful in their own right, but they do not represent scenes as we might see them if we were looking at them. They are also less informative as to the layout of the space they represent. The fact that perspective and information about spatial layout go together reveals something important about seeing. Not only do we see the world through an egocentric frame but we also see it in a way that allows us to extract information about distances to, and sizes of, objects relative to us, and relative to one another.",
		"When you are stressed out, you may not even realize all of the ways in which your mind and body are affected. However, you can easily recognize this connection between tension and memory, if you stop and think about a time when your memory failed because you were overly anxious. For example, your boss suddenly asks you for a key fact or number during a big, highly anticipated meeting. You freeze up and can’t remember it even though you knew it well the night before. But if a co-worker asks you the same question while passing in the hall, you easily recall the information and immediately provide the right answer. Reducing stress and tension will help you improve your memory dramatically. Just by maintaining a calm, focused attitude toward whatever you are doing, you will be able to reduce the negative effects of intense anxiety so you can perform at your best.",
		"Adaptation involves changes in a population, with characteristics that are passed from one generation to the next. This is different from acclimation—an individual organism’s changes in response to an altered environment.  For example, if you spend the summer outside, you may acclimate to the sunlight: your skin will increase its concentration of dark pigments that protect you from the sun. This is a temporary change, and you won’t pass the temporary change on to future generations. However, the capacity to produce skin pigments is inherited. For populations living in intensely sunny environments, individuals with a good ability to produce skin pigments are more likely to thrive, or to survive, than people with a poor ability to produce pigments, and that trait becomes increasingly common in subsequent generations. If you look around, you can find countless examples of adaptation. The distinctive long neck of a giraffe, for example, developed as individuals that happened to have longer necks had an advantage in feeding on the leaves of tall trees.",
		"We sometimes solve number problems almost without realizing it. For example, suppose you are conducting a meeting and you want to ensure that everyone there has a copy of the agenda. You can deal with this by labelling each copy of the handout in turn with the initials of each of those present. As long as you do not run out of copies before completing this process, you will know that you have a sufficient number to go around. You have then solved this problem without resorting to arithmetic and without explicit counting. There are numbers at work for us here all the same and they allow precise comparison of one collection with another, even though the members that make up the collections could have entirely different characters, as is the case here, where one set is a collection of people, while the other consists of pieces of paper. What numbers allow us to do is to compare the relative size of one set with another.",
		"Throughout history, people have changed their behavior to avoid taxes. Centuries ago, the Duke of Tuscany imposed a tax on salt. Tuscan bakers responded by eliminating salt in their recipes and giving us the delicious Tuscan bread we enjoy today. If you visit Amsterdam, you will notice that almost all the old houses are narrow and tall. They were constructed that way to minimize property taxes, which were based on the width of a house. Consider another architectural example, the invention of the mansard roof in France. Property taxes were often imposed on the number of rooms in a house and, therefore, rooms on the second or third floor were considered just as ratable as those on the ground floor. But if a mansard roof was constructed on the third floor, those rooms were considered to be part of an attic and not taxed.",
		"On any day of the year, the tropics and the hemisphere that is experiencing its warm season receive much more solar radiation than do the polar regions and the colder hemisphere. Averaged over the course of the year, the tropics and latitudes up to about 40° receive more total heat than they lose by radiation. Latitudes above 40° receive less total heat than they lose by radiation. This inequality produces the necessary conditions for the operation of a huge, global‐scale engine that takes on heat in the tropics and gives it off in the polar regions. Its working fluid is the atmosphere, especially the moisture it contains. Air is heated over the warm earth of the tropics, expands, rises, and flows away both northward and southward at high altitudes, cooling as it goes. It descends and flows toward the equator again from more northerly and southerly latitudes.",
		"Film has no grammar. There are, however, some vaguely defined rules of usage in cinematic language, and the syntax of film―its systematic arrangement―orders these rules and indicates relationships among them. As with written and spoken languages, it is important to remember that the syntax of film is a result of its usage, not a determinant of it. There is nothing preordained about film syntax. Rather, it evolved naturally as certain devices were found in practice to be both workable and useful. Like the syntax of written and spoken language, the syntax of film is an organic development, descriptive rather than prescriptive, and it has changed considerably over the years. “Hollywood Grammar” may sound laughable now, but during the thirties, forties, and early fifties it was an accurate model of the way Hollywood films were constructed.",
		"How can we help students manage cognitive load as they learn to perform complex tasks? One method that has proved effective in research studies is to support some aspects of a complex task while students perform the entire task. For example, Swelter and Cooper demonstrated this with students learning to solve problems in a variety of quantitative fields from statistics to physics. They found that when students were given typical word problems, it was possible for them to solve the problems without actually learning much. This is because the problems themselves were sufficiently demanding that students had no cognitive resources available to learn from what they did. But when students were given “worked­examples” (such as pre­solved problems) placed between problems to solve, studying the worked­examples freed up cognitive resources that allowed students to see the key features of the problem and to analyze the steps and reasons behind problem­solving moves. The researchers found this improved students’ performance on subsequent problem solving. This result, called the worked­example effect, is one example of a process called scaffolding, by which instructors temporarily relieve some of the cognitive load so that students can focus on particular dimensions of learning.",
		"One way of measuring temperature occurs if an object is hot enough to visibly glow, such as a metal poker that has been left in a fire. The color of a glowing object is related to its temperature: as the temperature rises, the object is first red and then orange, and finally it gets white, the “hottest” color. The relation between temperature and the color of a glowing object is useful to astronomers. The color of stars is related to their temperature, and since people cannot as yet travel the great distances to the stars and measure their temperature in a more precise way, astronomers rely on their color. This temperature is of the surface of the star, the part of the star which is emitting the light that can be seen. The interior of the star is at a much higher temperature, though it is concealed. But the information obtained from the color of the star is still useful.",
		"Why Neanderthals became extinct about 40,000 years ago to be replaced by modern humans is debated, but the two most favored theories are deteriorating climate conditions together with competition from the new arrivals. Since the Neanderthals had already become acclimatized to cold conditions for at least 200,000 years in Europe, it may seem counterintuitive that they lost out to the new arrivals, who were not only unaccustomed to cold climate but who came from a subtropical African climate, via the Near East. It appears that the technological superiority of Homo sapiens played a role. The population of the new arrivals increased tenfold as the population of the existing Neanderthals decreased. At least one researcher has speculated that the ability of the new arrivals to produce more advanced clothing involving closely fitting skins was significant. This presumably required sewing hides together, possibly in double layers, and fastening them with buttons or pegs, allowing the wearer to hunt in colder conditions. In contrast, the Neanderthals may have had only a single layer or wrap­around clothing, which did not involve sophisticated tailoring or sewing.",
		"Slang is actually quite difficult for linguists to find out about. You will have your local slang that you use in your school or in your town, and there’s no way I would ever know about it unless you told me what it was.  Indeed, in your area you’ll probably have several different kinds of slang. The slang that kids use in primary school is likely to be different from what is used in secondary school.  If your town has several schools, there are often differences in the kind of slang heard in each school. And there may even be words that are used differently within a single school. I once worked with a group of students in the final year of senior school, who listened out for the slang used in their school. They found that the slang used by first­year students was very different from their own.",
		"Utilitarian ethics argues that all action should be directed toward achieving the greatest total amount of happiness for the largest number of people. Utilitarian ethics assumes that all actions can be evaluated in terms of their moral worth, and so the desirability of an action is determined by its resulting hedonistic consequences. This is a consequentialist creed, assuming that the moral value and desirability of an action can be determined from its likely outcomes. Jeremy Bentham suggested that the value of hedonistic outcomes can be quantitatively assessed, so that the value of consequent pleasure can be derived by multiplying its intensity and its duration. In contrast, the other major advocate of utilitarianism, John Stuart Mill, argued for a more qualitative approach, assuming that there can be different subjective levels of pleasure. Higher­quality pleasures are more desirable than lower­quality pleasures. Less sophisticated creatures (like pigs!) have an easier access to the simpler pleasures, but more sophisticated creatures like humans have the capacity to access higher pleasures and should be motivated to seek those.",
		"Any negotiation is bounded in terms of time allocated to it, and time constraints are especially important when it comes to constitutional negotiations. Constitutions are typically, though not always, adopted in moments of high political drama, perhaps even violent crisis. Often there are upstream constraints that limit the amount of time available to drafters－deadlines that are exogenously fixed and cannot be evaded. These constraints may be helpful to facilitate agreement, as they put pressure on parties to come to agreement. But they also bound the negotiation and prevent the parties from spelling out a complete set of arrangements, and so the constitutional bargain will of necessity be incomplete. Negotiators may focus only on the largest, most salient issues, leaving more minor ones unresolved. Time pressures contribute to the introduction of structural mistakes in the constitutional text, seeding pitfalls for the immediate post­constitution­making period.",
		"The holy grail of the first wave of creativity research was a personality test to measure general creativity ability, in the same way that IQ measured general intelligence. A person’s creativity score should tell us his or her creative potential in any field of endeavor, just like an IQ score is not limited to physics, math, or literature. But by the 1970s, psychologists realized there was no such thing as a general “creativity quotient.” Creative people aren’t creative in a general, universal way; they’re creative in a specific sphere of activity, a particular domain.  We don’t expect a creative scientist to also be a gifted painter. A creative violinist may not be a creative conductor, and a creative conductor may not be very good at composing new works. Psychologists now know that creativity is domain specific.",
		"Flipped Learning allows for a variety of learning modes. Educators often physically rearrange their learning spaces to support either group work or independent study. They create flexible spaces in which students choose when and where they learn. Furthermore, educators who flip their classes are flexible in their expectations of student timelines for learning and in their assessments of student learning.  In the traditional teacher­centered model, the teacher is the primary source of information. By contrast, the Flipped Learning model shifts instruction to a learner­centered approach, where in­class time is spent exploring topics in greater depth. As a result, students are actively involved in knowledge construction as they participate in and evaluate their learning in a personally meaningful manner.",
		"Wind direction is usually measured through the use of a simple vane. This is simply a paddle of some sort mounted on a spindle; when it catches the wind, it turns so that the wind passes by without obstruction. The direction is recorded, but if you ever have a chance to watch a wind vane on a breezy day, you will notice that there is a lot of variation in the direction of wind flow―a lot! Sometimes the wind can blow from virtually every direction within a minute or two. In order to make some sense of this, an average wind direction over an hour is sometimes calculated, or sometimes the direction that the wind blew from the most during the hour is recorded. Either way, it is a generalization, and it’s important to remember that there can be a lot of variation in the data. It’s also important to remember that the data recorded at a weather station give an indication of conditions prevailing in an area but will not be exactly the same as the conditions at a landscape some distance from the weather station.",
		"In the early stages of modern science, scientists communicated their creative ideas largely by publishing books. This modus operandi is illustrated not only by Newton’s Principia, but also by Copernicus’ On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres, Kepler’s The Harmonies of the World, and Galileo’s Dialogues Concerning the Two New Sciences. With the advent of scientific periodicals, such as the Transactions of the Royal Society of London, books gradually yielded ground to the technical journal article as the chief form of scientific communication.  Of course, books were not abandoned altogether, as Darwin’s Origin of Species shows. Even so, it eventually became possible for scientists to establish a reputation for their creative contributions without publishing a single book­length treatment of their ideas. For instance, the revolutionary ideas that earned Einstein his Nobel Prize―concerning the special theory of relativity and the photoelectric effect―appeared as papers in the Annalen der Physik. His status as one of the greatest scientists of all time does not depend on the publication of a single book.",
		"The shift from analog to digital technology significantly influenced how music was produced. First and foremost, the digitization of sounds―that is, their conversion into numbers― enabled music makers to undo what was done. One could, in other words, twist and bend sounds toward something new without sacrificing the original version.  This “undo” ability made mistakes considerably less momentous, sparking the creative process and encouraging a generally more experimental mindset. In addition, digitally converted sounds could be manipulated simply by programming digital messages rather than using physical tools, simplifying the editing process significantly. For example, while editing once involved razor blades to physically cut and splice audiotapes, it now involved the cursor and mouse-click of the computer-based sequencer program, which was obviously less time consuming. Because the manipulation of digitally converted sounds meant the reprogramming of binary information, editing operations could be performed with millisecond precision. This microlevel access at once made it easier to conceal any traces of manipulations (such as joining tracks in silent spots) and introduced new possibilities for manipulating sounds in audible and experimental ways.",
		"Reading resembles driving on the road. You learn not to speed in the cities because it’s dangerous. You also learn that driving slowly on the highway is as dangerous as racing in the cities. Reading operates in the same way. It is harmful to use the same reading speed to handle different types of books. In reading, crashes happen when your reading speed is not appropriate for the type of book you’re reading. When you experience a reading crash, you feel sleepy after a short time, get lost in the big picture, or cannot link together the information. To avoid such symptoms, you need to consider the type and density of the book. Different types of books demand different gears and speeds. Applying the right gear for the right type of book helps keep you safe on your reading trip.",
		"Bundle pricing is packaging together two or more products, usually complementary ones, to be sold for a single price, which is usually considerably less than the sum of the prices of the individual products. Bundle pricing facilitates customer satisfaction and, when slow­moving products are bundled with products with higher turnover, can help a company stimulate sales and increase revenues. Selling products as a package rather than individually also may result in cost savings, so bundle pricing is commonly used for banking and travel services, computers, and automobiles with option packages. Some organizations, however, are unbundling in favor of a more itemized approach sometimes called à la carte pricing. This provides customers with the opportunity to pick and choose the products they want without having to purchase bundles that may not be the right mix for their purposes. Furthermore, with the help of the Internet, comparison shopping has become more convenient than ever, allowing customers to price items and create their own mixes. Nevertheless, bundle pricing continues to appeal to customers who prefer the convenience of a package.",
		"A supply schedule refers to the ability of a business to change their production rates to meet the demand of consumers. Some businesses are able to increase their production level quickly in order to meet increased demand. However, sporting clubs have a fixed, or inflexible (inelastic) production capacity. They have what is known as a fixed supply schedule. It is worth noting that this is not the case for sales of clothing, equipment, memberships and memorabilia. But clubs and teams can only play a certain number of times during their season.  If fans and members are unable to get into a venue, that revenue is lost forever. Although sport clubs and leagues may have a fixed supply schedule, it is possible to increase the number of consumers who watch. For example, the supply of a sport product can be increased by providing more seats, changing the venue, extending the playing season or even through new television, radio or Internet distribution.",
		"Acknowledging the making of artworks does not require a detailed, technical knowledge of, say, how painters mix different kinds of paint, or how an image editing tool works. All that is required is a general sense of a significant difference between working with paints and working with an imaging application. This sense might involve a basic familiarity with paints and paintbrushes as well as a basic familiarity with how we use computers, perhaps including how we use consumer imaging apps. In the case of specialists such as art critics, a deeper familiarity with materials and techniques is often useful in reaching an informed judgement about a work. This is because every kind of artistic material or tool comes with its own challenges and affordances for artistic creation. Critics are often interested in the ways artists exploit different kinds of materials and tools for particular artistic effect. They are also interested in the success of an artist’s attempt―embodied in the artwork itself―to push the limits of what can be achieved with certain materials and tools.",
		"In primitive agricultural systems, the difference in productivity between male and female agricultural labor is roughly proportional to the difference in physical strength. As agriculture becomes less dependent upon human muscular power, the difference in labor productivity between the two genders might be expected to narrow. However, this is far from being so. It is usually the men who learn to operate new types of equipment while women continue to work with old hand tools. With the introduction of improved agricultural equipment, there is less need for male muscular strength. Nevertheless, the productivity gap tends to widen because men dominate the use of the new equipment and modern agricultural methods. Thus, in the course of agricultural development, women’s labor productivity remains unchanged compared to men’s.",
		"In the classical period of European music, much musical material was de facto considered common property. When Antonio Vivaldi presented in Venice his opera Rosmira fedele, the score was actually a pastiche in which, among his own ideas, musicologists later identified ideas by George Frederic Handel, Giovanni Battista Pergolesi and Johann Adolph Hasse, among others. As far as recycling of segments of music initially written for other occasions into new pieces is concerned, it needs to be observed how today composers are discouraged from doing so for a number of reasons. A practical one is that each new piece is sure to remain available, in score or as an audio file. In the 18th century, on the contrary, once the particular occasion for performing a new piece was over, it became almost impossible to ever hear it again. Under such circumstances, recycling previously composed music was the only way to make it more durable. And if new pieces also contained ideas from other composers, that would re-enforce European musical traditions by increasing the circulation of melodies and harmonic patterns people loved to hear.",
		"Often time, or lack of time, plays an important role in the purchase of everyday products. Milica Milosavljevic and his coworkers conducted an experiment looking at the relationship between visual salience and the decision to purchase. They showed subjects 15 different food items on fMRI, such as those we find in a candy vending machine at the train station, that is, bars, chips, fruity items, etc. These were rated by the subjects on a scale of 1–15 according to “favorite snack” to “don’t like at all.” They were then presented in varying brightness and time, with subjects always having to make a choice between two products. The result was that we don’t always buy what we like best, but when things have to happen quickly, we tend to go for the product that catches our eye the most. If we are also distracted because we are talking to someone, on the phone, or our thoughts are elsewhere at the moment, our actual preference for a product falls further into the background and visual conspicuousness comes to the fore. Colors play an important role in this.",
		"Brightness of sounds means much energy in higher frequencies, which can be calculated from the sounds easily. A violin has many more overtones compared to a flute and sounds brighter. An oboe is brighter than a classical guitar, and a crash cymbal brighter than a double bass. This is obvious, and indeed people like brightness. One reason is that it makes sound subjectively louder, which is part of the loudness war in modern electronic music, and in the classical music of the 19th century. All sound engineers know that if they play back a track to a musician that just has recorded this track and add some higher frequencies, the musician will immediately like the track much better. But this is a short-lived effect, and in the long run, people find such sounds too bright. So it is wise not to play back such a track with too much brightness, as it normally takes quite some time to convince the musician that less brightness serves his music better in the end.",
		"The era of unicellular life lasted for about three and half billion years, dominating most of the Earth’s history. But around half a billion years ago, during the Cambrian explosion, a diversity of multicellular life including major animal groups emerged in short period. Similarly, calculus was the Cambrian explosion for mathematics. Once it arrived, an amazing diversity of mathematical fields began to evolve. Their lineage is visible in their calculus-based names, in adjectives like differential and integral and analytic, as in differential geometry, integral equations, and analytic number theory. These advanced branches of mathematics are like the many branches and species of multicellular life. In this analogy, the microbes of mathematics are the earliest topics: numbers, shapes, and word problems. Like unicellular organisms, they dominated the mathematical scene for most of its history. But after the Cambrian explosion of calculus three hundred and fifty years ago, new mathematical life forms began to flourish, and they altered the landscape around them.",
		"If we look at contemporary British ‘culture’ we will probably quickly conclude that sport is an important part of the culture. In other words, it is something that many people in the society share and value. In addition, we would also probably conclude that the most ‘important’ sport within British culture is football. We would ‘know’ this from the evidence that on a daily basis there is a significant amount of ‘cultural’ activity all focused on football in terms of the amount of people who play it, watch it, read about it and talk about it. However, within British society not everybody would see football as ‘their’ game. It could be argued from looking at their ‘cultural’ activities and habits, that people from a middle­class background seem to prefer rugby over football, or that more women play netball than football. Equally, if you went to the USA and were talking about ‘football’, most people would assume you were talking about American football rather than soccer. From this we can conclude that different cultures produce different ways of understanding, or evaluating, human activities such as sport.",
		"Scientific discoveries are being brought to fruition at a faster rate than ever before. For example, in 1836, a machine was invented that mowed, threshed, and tied straw into bundles and poured grain into sacks. The machine was based on technology that even then was twenty years old, but it was not until 1930 that such a machine actually was marketed. The first English patent for a typewriter was issued in 1714, but another 150 years passed before typewriters were commercially available. Today, such delays between ideas and application are almost unthinkable. It is not that we are more eager or more ambitious than our ancestors but that we have, over time, invented all sorts of social devices to hasten the process. Thus, we find that the time between the first and second stages of the innovative cycle― between idea and application―has been cut radically.",
		"Most of us have problems that have been posed to us (e.g., assignments from our supervisors). But we also recognize problems on our own (e.g., the need for additional parking space in the city where you work). After identifying the existence of a problem, we must define its scope and goals. The problem of parking space is often seen as a need for more parking lots or parking garages. However, in order to solve this problem creatively, it may be useful to redefine it as a problem of too many vehicles requiring a space to sit in during the workday. In that case, you may decide to organize a carpool among people who use downtown parking lots and institute a daytime local taxi service using these privately owned vehicles. Thus, you solve the problem not as you originally posed it but as you later reconceived it.",
		"Scientists who have observed plants growing in the dark have found that they are vastly different in appearance, form, and function from those grown in the light. This is true even when the plants in the different light conditions are genetically identical and are grown under identical conditions of temperature, water, and nutrient level. Seedlings grown in the dark limit the amount of energy going to organs that do not function at full capacity in the dark, like cotyledons and roots, and instead initiate elongation of the seedling stem to propel the plant out of darkness. In full light, seedlings reduce the amount of energy they allocate to stem elongation. The energy is directed to expanding their leaves and developing extensive root systems. This is a good example of phenotypic plasticity. The seedling adapts to distinct environmental conditions by modifying its form and the underlying metabolic and biochemical processes.",
		"As particular practices are repeated over time and become more widely shared, the values that they embody are reinforced and reproduced and we speak of them as becoming ‘institutionalized’. In some cases, this institutionalization has a formal face to it, with rules and protocols written down, and specialized roles created to ensure that procedures are followed correctly. The main institutions of state― parliament, courts, police and so on―along with certain of the professions, exhibit this formal character. Other social institutions, perhaps the majority, are not like this; science is an example. Although scientists are trained in the substantive content of their discipline, they are not formally instructed in ‘how to be a good scientist’. Instead, much like the young child learning how to play ‘nicely’, the apprentice scientist gains his or her understanding of the moral values inherent in the role by absorption from their colleagues―socialization. We think that these values, along with the values that inform many of the professions, are under threat, just as the value of the professions themselves is under threat.",
		"In most organizations, the employee’s immediate supervisor evaluates the employee’s performance. This is because the supervisor is responsible for the employee’s performance, providing supervision, handing out assignments, and developing the employee. A problem, however, is that supervisors often work in locations apart from their employees and therefore are not able to observe their subordinates’ performance. Should supervisors rate employees on performance dimensions they cannot observe? To eliminate this dilemma, more and more organizations are implementing assessments referred to as 360-degree evaluations. Employees are rated not only by their supervisors but by coworkers, clients or citizens, professionals in other agencies with whom they work, and subordinates. The reason for this approach is that often coworkers and clients or citizens have a greater opportunity to observe an employee’s performance and are in a better position to evaluate many performance dimensions.",
		"Interest in ideology in children’s literature arises from a belief that children’s literary texts are culturally formative, and of massive importance educationally, intellectually, and socially. Perhaps more than any other texts, they reflect society as it wishes to be, as it wishes to be seen, and as it unconsciously reveals itself to be, at least to writers. Clearly, literature is not the only socialising agent in the life of children, even among the media. It is possible to argue, for example, that, today, the influence of books is vastly overshadowed by that of television. There is, however, a considerable degree of interaction between the two media. Many so­called children’s literary classics are televised, and the resultant new book editions strongly suggest that viewing can encourage subsequent reading. Similarly, some television series for children are published in book form.",
		"The role that sleep plays in evolution is still under study. One possibility is that it is an advantageous adaptive state of decreased metabolism for an animal when there are no more pressing activities.  This seems true for deeper states of inactivity such as hibernation during the winter when there are few food supplies, and a high metabolic cost to maintaining adequate temperature.  It may be true in daily situations as well, for instance for a prey species to avoid predators after dark.  On the other hand, the apparent universality of sleep, and the observation that mammals such as cetaceans have developed such highly complex mechanisms to preserve sleep on at least one side of the brain at a time, suggests that sleep additionally provides some vital service(s) for the organism. This is particularly true since one aspect of sleep is decreased responsiveness to the environment. If sleep is universal even when this potential price must be paid, the implication may be that it has important functions that cannot be obtained just by quiet, wakeful resting.",
		"When trees grow together, nutrients and water can be optimally divided among them all so that each tree can grow into the best tree it can be. If you “help” individual trees by getting rid of their supposed competition, the remaining trees are bereft. They send messages out to their neighbors unsuccessfully, because nothing remains but stumps. Every tree now grows on its own, giving rise to great differences in productivity. Some individuals photosynthesize like mad until sugar positively bubbles along their trunk. As a result, they are fit and grow better, but they aren’t particularly long-lived. This is because a tree can be only as strong as the forest that surrounds it. And there are now a lot of losers in the forest. Weaker members, who would once have been supported by the stronger ones, suddenly fall behind. Whether the reason for their decline is their location and lack of nutrients, a passing sickness, or genetic makeup, they now fall prey to insects and fungi.",
		"The birth of a child in a family is often the reason why people begin to take up or rediscover photography. In many ways, photographing a child is little different from photographing any other person. What makes it different, however, is the relative height between a young child and an adult. Using the camera at your own head height works well for photographing adults, but for children the camera will be tilted downward. You are looking down on the child, literally and metaphorically, and the resulting picture can make the child look smaller and less significant than most parents would like. It is possible to obtain more natural-looking portraits when the camera shoots from the same level as the child’s eyeline instead of being tilted. For an eight year old, this might mean sitting down when shooting; and for a crawling baby, the best approach may be to lie on the floor.",
		"The United Nations asks that all companies remove their satellites from orbit within 25 years after the end of their mission. This is tricky to enforce, though, because satellites can (and often do) fail. To tackle this problem, several companies around the world have come up with novel solutions. These include removing dead satellites from orbit and dragging them back into the atmosphere, where they will burn up. Ways we could do this include using a harpoon to grab a satellite, catching it in a huge net, using magnets to grab it, or even firing lasers to heat up the satellite, increasing its atmospheric drag so that it falls out of orbit. However, these methods are only useful for large satellites orbiting Earth. There isn’t really a way for us to pick up smaller pieces of debris such as bits of paint and metal. We just have to wait for them to naturally re­enter Earth’s atmosphere.",
		"There are different kinds of knowledge. Some is domain-specific knowledge that relates to a particular task or subject. For example, knowing that the shortstop plays between second and third base is specific to the domain of baseball. Some knowledge, on the other hand, is general―it applies to many different situations. For example, general knowledge about how to read or write or use a computer is useful both in and out of school.  Of course, there is no absolute line between general and domain-specific knowledge. When you were first learning to read, you may have studied specific facts about the sounds of letters. At that time, knowledge about letter sounds was specific to the domain of reading. But now you can use both knowledge about sounds and the ability to read in more general ways.",
		"Why does the skin on the extremities wrinkle after a bath? And why only the extremities? Despite its appearance, your skin isn’t shrinking after your bath. Actually, it is expanding. The skin on the fingers, palms, toes, and soles wrinkles only after it is soaked with water. The stratum corneum—the thick, dead, rough layer of the skin that protects us from the environment and that makes the skin on our hands and feet tougher and thicker than that on our stomachs or faces—expands when it soaks up water. This expansion causes the wrinkling effect. Actually, it does, but there is more room for the moisture to be absorbed in these less densely packed areas before it shows. So why doesn’t the skin on other parts of the body also wrinkle when soaked? One doctor we contacted said that soldiers whose feet are submerged in wet boots for a long period will exhibit wrinkling all over the covered area.",
		"Language, and the word “animal,” deceives us. The word “animal” categorizes all non-human animals and distances humans from other animals. Seeing all other animals as one group in contrast to humans reinforces anthropocentrism, which contributes to the legitimization of practices in which other animals are used for human benefit. Jacques Derrida argues that instead of one line between Man on the one side and Animal on the other, there is a multiple and heterogeneous border; beyond the edge of the “so-called human,” we find a heterogeneous plurality of the living. To account for this multitude, using the word “animot” has been proposed. In speech it refers to the plural, the multiplicity of animals, which is necessary because there is no one “animal.” The “mot” in “animot” refers to the act of naming and the risks involved in drawing a distinction between human and animal by the human. It reminds us of the fact that it is a word for animals, not a reference to an existing group of animals.",
		"Risk often arises from uncertainty about how to approach a problem or situation. One way to avoid such risk is to contract with a party who is experienced and knows how to do it. For example, to minimize the financial risk associated with the capital cost of tooling and equipment for production of a large, complex system, a manufacturer might subcontract the production of the system’s major components to suppliers familiar with those components. This relieves the manufacturer of the financial risk associated with the tooling and equipment to produce these components. However, transfer of one kind of risk often means inheriting another kind. For example, subcontracting work for the components puts the manufacturer in the position of relying on outsiders, which increases the risks associated with quality control, scheduling, and the performance of the end‑item system. But these risks often can be reduced through careful management of the suppliers.",
		"Babylonian astronomers created detailed records of celestial movements in the heavens, using the resulting tables to sieve out irregularities and, with them, the favour of the gods. This was the seed of what we now call the scientific method―a demonstration that accurate observations of the world could be used to forecast its future. The importance of measurement in this sort of cosmic comprehension did not develop smoothly over the centuries. Indeed, in the Middle Ages in Europe, calculating by hand and eye was sometimes seen as producing a rather shabby sort of knowledge, inferior to that of abstract thought. The suspicion was due to the influence of ancient Greeks in the era’s scholasticism, particularly Plato and Aristotle, who stressed that the material world was one of unceasing change and instability. They emphasized that reality was best understood by reference to immaterial qualities, be they Platonic forms or Aristotelian causes. It would take the revelations of the scientific revolution to fully displace these instincts, with observations of the night sky once again proving decisive.",
		"Whenever you perform a specific action (say, throwing a ball) your brain fires off in a very specific pattern. Interestingly, whenever you imagine yourself performing this same action, your brain fires off in almost the same pattern. This is why mental rehearsal is such a prominent technique in sports training: the brain doesn’t draw a strict distinction between the real and the imagined. Here’s the best bit: whenever you hear a story about a person performing this same action (throwing a ball) your brain will fire off in almost the same pattern. This doesn’t happen when you encounter this action in isolation (‘The man threw the ball’). But as soon as it’s embedded within a narrative your brain will respond largely as though you were performing the action. This means we do not simply listen to stories―we experience stories.",
		"If you apply all your extra money to paying off debt without saving for the things that are guaranteed to happen, you will feel like you’ve failed when something does happen. You will end up going further into debt. Let’s use an example of an unexpected auto repair bill of $500. If you don’t save for this, you’ll end up with another debt to pay off. You’ll feel frustrated that you have been working so hard to pay things off and yet you just added more debt to your list. On the other hand, if you are saving for auto repairs and pay down your debt a little slower, you will feel proud that you planned for the auto repair. You will have cash to pay for it, and you are still paying down your debt uninterrupted and on schedule. Instead of frustration and disappointment from the unexpected auto repair, you feel proud and excited.",
		"Ransom Olds, the father of the Oldsmobile, could not produce his “horseless carriages” fast enough. In 1901 he had an idea to speed up the manufacturing process—instead of building one car at a time, he created the assembly line. The acceleration in production was unheard‑of—from an output of 425 automobiles in 1901 to an impressive 2,500 cars the following year. While other competitors were in awe of this incredible volume, Henry Ford dared to ask, “Can we do even better?” He was, in fact, able to improve upon Olds’s clever idea by introducing conveyor belts to the assembly line. As a result, Ford’s production went through the roof. Instead of taking a day and a half to manufacture a Model T, as in the past, he was now able to spit them out at a rate of one car every ninety minutes.  The moral of the story is that good progress is often the herald of great progress.",
		"The linguistic resources we choose to use do not come to us as empty forms ready to be filled with our personal intentions; rather, they come to us with meanings already embedded within them. These meanings, however, are not derived from some universal, logical set of principles; rather, as with their shapes, they are built up over time from their past uses in particular contexts by particular groups of participants in the accomplishment of particular goals that, in turn, are shaped by myriad cultural, historical and institutional forces. The linguistic resources we choose to use at particular communicative moments come to these moments with their conventionalized histories of meaning. It is their conventionality that binds us to some degree to particular ways of realizing our collective history. However, while our resources come with histories of meanings, how they come to mean at a particular communicative moment is always open to negotiation. Thus, in our individual uses of our linguistic resources we accomplish two actions simultaneously. We create their typical—historical—contexts of use and at the same time we position ourselves in relation to these contexts.",
		"The earliest humans had access to only a very limited number of materials, those that occur naturally: stone, wood, clay, skins, and so on. With time, they discovered techniques for producing materials that had properties superior to those of the natural ones; these new materials included pottery and various metals. Furthermore, it was discovered that the properties of a material could be altered by heat treatments and by the addition of other substances. At this point, materials utilization was totally a selection process that involved deciding from a given, rather limited set of materials, the one best suited for an application based on its characteristics. It was not until relatively recent times that scientists came to understand the relationships between the structural elements of materials and their properties. This knowledge, acquired over approximately the past 100 years, has empowered them to fashion, to a large degree, the characteristics of materials. Thus, tens of thousands of different materials have evolved with rather specialized characteristics that meet the needs of our modern and complex society, including metals, plastics, glasses, and fibers.",
		"A dramatic example of how culture can influence our biological processes was provided by anthropologist Clyde Kluckhohn, who spent much of his career in the American Southwest studying the Navajo culture. Kluckhohn tells of a non­Navajo woman he knew in Arizona who took a somewhat perverse pleasure in causing a cultural response to food. At luncheon parties she often served sandwiches filled with a light meat that resembled tuna or chicken but had a distinctive taste. Only after everyone had finished lunch would the hostess inform her guests that what they had just eaten was neither tuna salad nor chicken salad but rather rattlesnake salad. Invariably, someone would vomit upon learning what they had eaten.  Here, then, is an excellent example of how the biological process of digestion was influenced by a cultural idea. Not only was the process influenced, it was reversed: the culturally based idea that rattlesnake meat is a disgusting thing to eat triggered a violent reversal of the normal digestive process.",
		"The growing complexity of the social dynamics determining food choices makes the job of marketers and advertisers increasingly more difficult. In the past, mass production allowed for accessibility and affordability of products, as well as their wide distribution, and was accepted as a sign of progress. Nowadays it is increasingly replaced by the fragmentation of consumers among smaller and smaller segments that are supposed to reflect personal preferences. Everybody feels different and special and expects products serving his or her inclinations. In reality, these supposedly individual preferences end up overlapping with emerging, temporary, always changing, almost tribal formations solidifying around cultural sensibilities, social identifications, political sensibilities, and dietary and health concerns. Personal stories connect with larger narratives to generate new identities. These consumer communities go beyond national boundaries, feeding on global and widely shared repositories of ideas, images, and practices.",
		"Most beliefs—but not all—are open to tests of verification. This means that beliefs can be tested to see if they are correct or false. Beliefs can be verified or falsified with objective criteria external to the person.  There are people who believe the Earth is flat and not a sphere. Because we have objective evidence that the Earth is in fact a sphere, the flat Earth belief can be shown to be false. Also, the belief that it will rain tomorrow can be tested for truth by waiting until tomorrow and seeing whether it rains or not. However, some types of beliefs cannot be tested for truth because we cannot get external evidence in our lifetimes (such as a belief that the Earth will stop spinning on its axis by the year 9999 or that there is life on a planet 100­million light­years away). Also, meta­physical beliefs (such as the existence and nature of a god) present considerable challenges in generating evidence that everyone is willing to use as a truth criterion.",
		"Going beyond very simple algorithms, some AI­based tools hold out the promise of supporting better causal and probabilistic reasoning in complex domains. Humans have a natural ability to build causal models of the world— that is, to explain why things happen—that AI systems still largely lack. For example, while a doctor can explain to a patient why a treatment works, referring to the changes it causes in the body, a modern machine­learning system could only tell you that patients who are given this treatment tend, on average, to get better. However, human reasoning is still notoriously prone to confusion and error when causal questions become sufficiently complex, such as when it comes to assessing the impact of policy interventions across society. In these cases, supporting human reasoning with more structured AI­based tools may be helpful. Researchers have been exploring the use of Bayesian Networks—an AI technology that can be used to map out the causal relationships between events, and to represent degrees of uncertainty around different areas—for decision support, such as to enable more accurate risk assessment. These may be particularly useful for assessing the threat of novel or rare threats, where little historical data is available, such as the risk of terrorist attacks and new ecological disasters.",
		"Everyone automatically categorizes and generalizes all the time. Unconsciously. It is not a question of being prejudiced or enlightened. Categories are absolutely necessary for us to function. They give structure to our thoughts.  Imagine if we saw every item and every scenario as truly unique―we would not even have a language to describe the world around us. But the necessary and useful instinct to generalize can distort our world view. It can make us mistakenly group together things, or people, or countries that are actually very different. It can make us assume everything or everyone in one category is similar. And, maybe, most unfortunate of all, it can make us jump to conclusions about a whole category based on a few, or even just one, unusual example.",
		"The world can be a different and better place if, while you are here, you give of yourself. This concept became clear to Azim one day when he was watching television at an airport terminal while waiting for a flight. A priest was sharing a story about newborn twins, one of whom was ill. The twins were in separate incubators, as per hospital rules. A nurse on the floor repeatedly suggested that the twins be kept together in one incubator. The doctors finally agreed to try this. When the twins were brought into contact with each other, the healthy twin immediately put his arms around his sick brother. This instinctive exchange gradually helped the sick twin to recover and regain his health. The babies’ family and the doctors witnessed the intangible force of love and the incredible power of giving.",
		"Government warnings and stark statistics about mercury­contaminated fish have become so routine that we barely take note. I have to ask: why have these warnings been aimed at getting people to cease eating fish, rather than at getting the industries to stop putting mercury into our environment? Finally in February 2009, near­global consensus was reached: more than 140 countries convened by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) unanimously agreed to create an international mercury treaty. They also urged immediate action through a voluntary Global Mercury Partnership while the treaty is being finalized. Getting mercury out of our production processes will be hard work and it will cost money, for sure. But investments in eliminating mercury are investments well spent. UNEP estimates that every kilogram of mercury taken out of the environment can lead to up to $12,500 worth of social, environmental, and human health benefits.",
		"Water molecules circulate through the atmosphere as a result of evaporation. As water molecules rise high up in the atmosphere, they may split up into their constituent chemical elements, hydrogen and oxygen, under the influence of sunlight. Whereas the much heavier oxygen either remains in the atmosphere or is captured on the Earth’s surface, the hydrogen tends to escape into space, because it is so light that Earth’s gravity cannot retain it. As long as there was little or no free oxygen in the atmosphere that could capture hydrogen before it escaped into the cosmos, this process would have continued unhindered. However, after all the available materials on the Earth’s surface, mostly iron, had combined with the free oxygen, it began to appear in the atmosphere in sizable quantities. As soon as this happened, the free oxygen would have captured most of the free hydrogen by forming water molecules again, thus slowing down the loss of hydrogen. Over the course of time, this process would have helped to retain water on Earth, while it also contributed to the emergence of oxygen in the atmosphere.",
		"It is vitally important that wherever we go and whatever we do the body temperature is maintained at the temperature at which our enzymes work best. It is not the temperature at the surface of the body which matters. It is the temperature deep inside the body which must be kept stable. At only a few degrees above or below normal body temperature our enzymes cannot function properly. If this goes on for any length of time the reactions in our cells cannot continue and we die. All sorts of things can affect internal body temperature, including heat generated in the muscles during exercise, fevers caused by disease, and the external temperature. We can control our temperature in lots of ways: we can change our clothing, the way we behave and how active we are. But we also have an internal control mechanism: when we get too hot we start to sweat.",
		"Liquids are destructive. Foams feel soft because they are easily compressed; if you jump on to a foam mattress, you’ll feel it give beneath you. Liquids don’t do this; instead they flow. You see this in a river, or when you turn on a tap, or if you use a spoon to stir your coffee. When you jump off a diving board and hit a body of water, the water has to flow away from you. But the flowing takes time, and if your speed of impact is too great, the water won’t be able to flow away fast enough, and so it pushes back at you. It’s that force that stings your skin as you belly-flop into a pool, and makes falling into water from a great height like landing on concrete. The incompressibility of water is also why waves can have such deadly power, and in the case of tsunamis, why they can destroy buildings and cities, tossing cars around easily.",
		"A meaningful level of complexity in our history consists of culture: information stored in nerve and brain cells or in human records of various kinds. The species that has developed this capacity the most is, of course, humankind. In terms of total body weight, our species currently makes up about 0.005 per cent of all planetary biomass. If all life combined were only a paint chip, all human beings today would jointly amount to no more than a tiny colony of bacteria sitting on that flake. Yet through their combined efforts humans have learned to control a considerable portion of the terrestrial biomass, today perhaps as much as between 25 and 40 per cent of it. In other words, thanks to its culture this tiny colony of microorganisms residing on a paint chip has gained control over a considerable portion of that flake. To understand how human societies operate, it is therefore not sufficient to only look at their DNA, their molecular mechanisms and the influences from the outside world. We also need to study the cultural information that humans have been using for shaping their own lives as well as considerable portions of the rest of nature.",
		"The evolutionary history of a species or a disease is like any other kind of history. There is no experiment, in the usual sense, that we can do now to decide how long ago our ancestors first started to use fires for cooking or other purposes and what subsequent evolutionary effects that change may have had. History can be investigated only by examining the records it has left. Charred bones or even carbon deposits from an ancient campfire can be informative documents to people who know how to read them. Likewise, the chemical structure of proteins and DNA may be read to reveal relationships among now strikingly different organisms. Until a time machine is invented, we will not be able to go back and watch the evolution of major traits, but we can nonetheless reconstruct prehistoric events by the records they left in fossils, carbon traces, structures, and behavioral tendencies, as well as protein and DNA structures. Even when we cannot reconstruct the history of a trait, we can often still be confident that it was shaped by natural selection.",
		"In the late twentieth century, researchers sought to measure how fast and how far news, rumours or innovations moved. More recent research has shown that ideas―even emotional states and conditions―can be transmitted through a social network. The evidence of this kind of contagion is clear: ‘Students with studious roommates become more studious. Diners sitting next to heavy eaters eat more food.’ However, according to Christakis and Fowler, we cannot transmit ideas and behaviours much beyond our friends’ friends’ friends (in other words, across just three degrees of separation). This is because the transmission and reception of an idea or behaviour requires a stronger connection than the relaying of a letter or the communication that a certain employment opportunity exists. Merely knowing people is not the same as being able to influence them to study more or over-eat. Imitation is indeed the sincerest form of flattery, even when it is unconscious.",
		"Emotion plays an essential role in all our pursuits― including our pursuit of happiness. It is nearly impossible for us to imagine a life without emotion.  Think of an emotionless robot that, other than the capacity for emotions, has exactly the same physical and cognitive characteristics as humans. The robot thinks and behaves in the same way that humans do. It can discuss deep philosophical issues and follow complex logic; it can dig tunnels and build skyscrapers. Yet, although the robot is sophisticated, it lacks all motivation to act. This is because even the most basic desires are dependent on emotions―the one thing this robot lacks.",
		"Many of the ritualized displays performed by animals look so bizarre to us that we wonder how they came about. Most of the various forms of signaling that are used by different species of animals have not arisen afresh in each separate species. As one species evolves into another, particular forms of signaling may be passed on, owing to the effects of both genes and learning or experience. Some signals have significance across many species, and so remain much the same over generations and in a number of species. But many signals, as they are passed from generation to generation by whatever means, go through changes that make them either more elaborate or simply different. If we examine closely related species, we can often see slight variations in a particular display and we can piece together an explanation for the spread of the display across species. Some very elaborate displays may have begun as simpler versions of the same behavioral pattern that became more elaborate as they developed and were passed on from generation to generation.",
		"Favorite websites sometimes greet users like old friends. Online bookstores welcome their customers by name and suggest new books they might like to read. Real estate sites tell their visitors about new properties that have come on the market. These tricks are made possible by cookies, small files that an Internet server stores inside individuals’ web browsers so it can remember them. Therefore, cookies can greatly benefit individuals. For example, cookies save users the chore of having to enter names and addresses into e­commerce websites every time they make a purchase. However, concerns have been raised that cookies, which can track what people do online, may be violating privacy by helping companies or government agencies accumulate personal information. Security is another concern: Cookies make shared computers far less secure and offer hackers many ways to break into systems.",
		"Some resources, decisions, or activities are important (highly valuable on average) while others are pivotal (small changes make a big difference). Consider how two components of a car relate to a consumer’s purchase decision: tires and interior design. Which adds more value on average? The tires. They are essential to the car’s ability to move, and they impact both safety and performance. Yet tires generally do not influence purchase decisions because safety standards guarantee that all tires will be very safe and reliable. Differences in interior features―optimal sound system, portable technology docks, number and location of cup holders― likely have far more effect on the consumer’s buying decision. In terms of the overall value of an automobile, you can’t drive without tires, but you can drive without cup holders and a portable technology dock. Interior features, however, clearly have a greater impact on the purchase decision. In our language, the tires are important, but the interior design is pivotal.",
		"In everyday life, we tend to see any collection of people as a group. However, social psychologists use this term more precisely. In particular, they define a group as two or more people who interact with, and exert mutual influences on, each other. It is this sense of mutual interaction or inter-dependence for a common purpose which distinguishes the members of a group from a mere aggregation of individuals. For example, as Kenneth Hodge observed, a collection of people who happen to go for a swim after work on the same day each week does not, strictly speaking, constitute a group because these swimmers do not interact with each other in a structured manner. By contrast, a squad of young competitive swimmers who train every morning before going to school is a group because they not only share a common objective (training for competition) but also interact with each other in formal ways (e.g., by warming up together beforehand). It is this sense of people coming together to achieve a common objective that defines a “team”.",
		"Carole Ames, dean of the college of education at Michigan State University, points out that it isn’t “quantitative changes in behavior” (such as requiring students to spend more hours in front of books or worksheets) that help children to learn better. Rather, it’s “qualitative changes in the ways students view themselves in relation to the task, engage in the process of learning, and then respond to the learning activities and situation.” In turn, these attitudes and responses on the part of students emerge from the way teachers think about learning and, as a result, the ways they’ve organized their classrooms. If the goal is to figure out how best to cover a set curriculum—to fill students with facts—then it might seem appropriate to try to maximize time on task, such as by assigning homework. But that’s unlikely to have a positive effect on the critical variables that Ames identifies. Perhaps it makes sense to see education as being less about how much the teacher covers and more about what the students can be helped to discover. More time won’t do a thing to bring about that shift.",
		"In the West, an individual composer writes the music long before it is performed. The patterns and melodies we hear are pre­planned and intended. Some African tribal music, however, results from collaboration by the players on the spur of the moment. The patterns heard, whether they are the silences when all players rest on a beat or the accented beats when all play together, are not planned but serendipitous. When an overall silence appears on beats 4 and 13, it is not because each musician is thinking, “On beats 4 and 13, I will rest.” Rather, it occurs randomly as the patterns of all the players converge upon a simultaneous rest. The musicians are probably as surprised as their listeners to hear the silences at beats 4 and 13. Surely that surprise is one of the joys tribal musicians experience in making their music.",
		"Each new wave of technology is intended to enhance user convenience, as well as improve security, but sometimes these do not necessarily go hand-in-hand. For example, the transition from magnetic stripe to embedded chip slightly slowed down transactions, sometimes frustrating customers in a hurry. Make a service too burdensome, and the potential customer will go elsewhere. This obstacle applies at several levels. Passwords, double-key identification, and biometrics such as fingerprint-, iris-, and voice recognition are all ways of keeping the account details hidden from potential fraudsters, of keeping your data dark. But they all inevitably add a burden to the use of the account. On top of the hurdles introduced in accessing his or her money, if a suspected fraud is detected, the account holder has to deal with the phone call asking if he or she made the suspicious transactions. This is all useful at some level―indeed, it can be reassuring knowing that your bank is keeping alert to protect you―but it becomes tiresome if too many such calls are received.",
		"It is important to remember that computers can only carry out instructions that humans give them. Computers can process data accurately at far greater speeds than people can, yet they are limited in many respects―most importantly, they lack common sense. However, combining the strengths of these machines with human strengths creates synergy. Synergy occurs when combined resources produce output that exceeds the sum of the outputs of the same resources employed separately. A computer works quickly and accurately; humans work relatively slowly and make mistakes. A computer cannot make independent decisions, however, or formulate steps for solving problems, unless programmed to do so by humans. Even with sophisticated artificial intelligence, which enables the computer to learn and then implement what it learns, the initial programming must be done by humans. Thus, a human‒ computer combination allows the results of human thought to be translated into efficient processing of large amounts of data.",
		"Simply maintaining yields at current levels often requires new cultivars and management methods, since pests and diseases continue to evolve, and aspects of the chemical, physical, and social environment can change over several decades. In the 1960s, many people considered pesticides to be mainly beneficial to mankind. Developing new, broadly effective, and persistent pesticides often was considered to be the best way to control pests on crop plants. Since that time, it has become apparent that broadly effective pesticides can have harmful effects on beneficial insects, which can negate their effects in controlling pests, and that persistent pesticides can damage non-target organisms in the ecosystem, such as birds and people. Very high costs are involved in following all of the procedures needed to gain government approval for new pesticides. Also, it has become difficult for companies to develop new pesticides, even those that can have major beneficial effects and few negative effects. Consequently, more consideration is being given to other ways to manage pests, such as incorporating greater resistance to pests into cultivars by breeding and using other biological control methods.",
		"For hundreds of thousands of years our hunter‒gatherer ancestors could survive only by constantly communicating with one another through nonverbal cues. Developed over so much time, before the invention of language, that is how the human face became so expressive, and gestures so elaborate. We have a continual desire to communicate our feelings and yet at the same time the need to conceal them for proper social functioning. With these counterforces battling inside us, we cannot completely control what we communicate. Our real feelings continually leak out in the form of gestures, tones of voice, facial expressions, and posture. We are not trained, however, to pay attention to people’s nonverbal cues. By sheer habit, we fixate on the words people say, while also thinking about what we’ll say next. What this means is that we are using only a small percentage of the potential social skills we all possess.",
		"The dynamics of collective detection have an interesting feature. Which cue(s) do individuals use as evidence of predator attack? In some cases, when an individual detects a predator, its best response is to seek shelter. Departure from the group may signal danger to nonvigilant animals and cause what appears to be a coordinated flushing of prey from the area. Studies on dark-eyed juncos (a type of bird) support the view that nonvigilant animals attend to departures of individual group mates but that the departure of multiple individuals causes a greater escape response in the nonvigilant individuals. If one group member departs, it might have done so for a number of reasons that have little to do with predation threat. If nonvigilant animals escaped each time a single member left the group, they would frequently respond when there was no predator (a false alarm). This makes sense from the perspective of information reliability. On the other hand, when several individuals depart the group at the same time, a true threat is much more likely to be present.",
		"In 1996, as construction workers cleared a site in downtown Athens for the foundations of a new Museum of Modern Art, they found traces of a large structure sitting on the bedrock. A building had occupied this same spot some two-and-a-half thousand years earlier, when it was part of a wooded sanctuary outside the original city walls, on the banks of the River Ilissos. The excavation uncovered the remains of a gymnasium, a wrestling arena, changing rooms and baths. This had been a place for athletics and exercise, where the young men of Athens had trained to become soldiers and citizens. But it was more than just a centre for physical improvement. The archaeologists soon realised that they had found one of the most significant sites in all of western European intellectual culture, a site referred to continually by historys greatest philosophers: the Lyceum of Aristotle. (  ) It was the worlds first university.",
		"The liberalization of capital markets, where funds for investment can be borrowed, has been an important contributor to the pace of globalization. Since the 1970s there has been a trend towards a freer flow of capital across borders.  Current economic theory suggests that this should aid development. Developing countries have limited domestic savings with which to invest in growth, and liberalization allows them to tap into a global pool of funds.  A global capital market also allows investors greater scope to manage and spread their risks. However, some say that a freer flow of capital has raised the risk of financial instability. The East Asian crisis of the late 1990s came in the wake of this kind of liberalization.  Without a strong financial system and a sound regulatory environment, capital market globalization can sow the seeds of instability in economies rather than growth.",
		"The boundary between uniquely human creativity and machine capabilities continues to change. Returning to the game of chess, back in 1956, thirteen­year­old child prodigy Bobby Fischer made a pair of remarkably creative moves against grandmaster Donald Byrne. First he sacrificed his knight, seemingly for no gain, and then exposed his queen to capture. On the surface, these moves seemed insane, but several moves later, Fischer used these moves to win the game. His creativity was praised at the time as the mark of genius. Yet today if you program that same position into an ordinary chess program, it will immediately suggest the exact moves that Fischer made. It’s not because the computer has memorized the Fischer­Byrne game, but rather because it searches far enough ahead to see that these moves really do pay off.",
		"Of all the medical achievements of the 1960s, the most widely known was the first heart transplant, performed by the South African surgeon Christiaan Barnard in 1967. The patient’s death 18 days later did not weaken the spirits of those who welcomed a new era of medicine. The ability to perform heart transplants was linked to the development of respirators, which had been introduced to hospitals in the 1950s. Respirators could save many lives, but not all those whose hearts kept beating ever recovered any other significant functions. In some cases, their brains had ceased to function altogether. The realization that such patients could be a source of organs for transplantation led to the setting up of the Harvard Brain Death Committee, and to its recommendation that the absence of all “discernible central nervous system activity” should be “a new criterion for death”. The recommendation has since been adopted, with some modifications, almost everywhere.",
		"Two major kinds of age­related structural changes occur in the eye. One is a decrease in the amount of light that passes through the eye, resulting in the need for more light to do tasks such as reading. As you might suspect, this change is one reason why older adults do not see as well in the dark, which may account in part for their reluctance to go places at night. One possible logical response to the need for more light would be to increase illumination levels in general. However, this solution does not work in all situations because we also become increasingly sensitive to glare. In addition, our ability to adjust to changes in illumination, called adaptation, declines. Going from outside into a darkened movie theater involves dark adaptation; going back outside involves light adaptation. Research indicates that the time it takes for both types of adaptation increases with age.",
		"By acting on either natural or artificial resources, through techniques, we alter them in various ways. Thus we create artifacts, which form an important aspect of technologies. A clay pot is an example of a material artifact, which, although transformed by human activity, is not all that far removed from its natural state. A plastic cup, a contact lens, and a computer chip, on the other hand, are examples of artifacts that are far removed from the original states of the natural resources needed to create them. Artifacts can serve as resources in other technological processes. This is one of the important interaction effects within the technological system. In other words, each new technology increases the stock of available tools and resources that can be employed by other technologies to produce new artifacts.",
		"You may be wondering why people prefer to prioritize internal disposition over external situations when seeking causes to explain behaviour. One answer is simplicity. Thinking of an internal cause for a person’s behaviour is easy—the strict teacher is a stubborn person, the devoted parents just love their kids. In contrast, situational explanations can be complex.  Perhaps the teacher appears stubborn because she’s seen the consequences of not trying hard in generations of students and wants to develop self‑discipline in them.  Perhaps the parents who’re boasting of the achievements of their children are anxious about their failures, and conscious of the cost of their school fees. These situational factors require knowledge, insight, and time to think through. Whereas, jumping to a dispositional attribution is far easier.",
		"A child bounces up to you holding her school work; perhaps she’s your daughter, cousin, or neighbour.  She proudly shows you a big red A at the bottom of her test paper. How do you praise her? For decades, people have been told that praise is vital for happy and healthy children and that the most important job in raising a child is nurturing her self‑esteem. Recently, however, some researchers found that how people are praised is very important. They discovered that if you say “What a very clever girl you are!” to the child showing you an A, you may cause her more harm than good. For your children to succeed and be happy, you need to convince them that success comes from effort, not from some talent that they’re born with or without.",
		"Framing matters in many domains. When credit cards started to become popular forms of payment in the 1970s, some retail merchants wanted to charge different prices to their cash and credit card customers. To prevent this, credit card companies adopted rules that forbade their retailers from charging different prices to cash and credit customers. However, when a bill was introduced in Congress to outlaw such rules, the credit card lobby turned its attention to language. Its preference was that if a company charged different prices to cash and credit customers, the credit price should be considered the “normal” (default) price and the cash price a discount― rather than the alternative of making the cash price the usual price and charging a surcharge to credit card customers. The credit card companies had a good intuitive understanding of what psychologists would come to call “framing.” The idea is that choices depend, in part, on the way in which problems are stated.",
		"Tap your finger on the surface of a wooden table or desk, and observe the loudness of the sound you hear. Then, place your ear flat on top of the table or desk. With your finger about one foot away from your ear, tap the table top and observe the loudness of the sound you hear again. The volume of the sound you hear with your ear on the desk is much louder than with it off the desk. Sound waves are capable of traveling through many solid materials as well as through air. Solids, like wood for example, transfer the sound waves much better than air typically does because the molecules in a solid substance are much closer and more tightly packed together than they are in air. This allows the solids to carry the waves more easily and efficiently, resulting in a louder sound. The density of the air itself also plays a determining factor in the loudness of sound waves passing through it.",
		"Power and knowledge, as well as ignorance, are interconnected in a productive and constitutive relationship. Rulers know that power cannot be executed without knowledge—mortality tables, tax data, and the like are crucial to running an effective public administration—and conquerors have understood that information is essential for dominating a territory. Since the twentieth century, Western societies have defined themselves as knowledge societies, where knowledge is essential for social organization and productivity. At the same time, the lack of knowledge proved to be important for stabilizing political and social order. For instance, secrets were essential to creating legitimacy in the early modern period, when individuals believed the world was created and ruled by divine power. By concealing the circumstances of their decisions, rulers cultivated a special aura that set them apart from ordinary people and made them seem more like unknowable gods. The complementary relationship between knowledge and ignorance is perhaps most exposed in transitional societies seeking to first disrupt and then stabilize social and political order.",
		"Ore deposits represent work that nature does for us. For instance, Earth’s crust contains an average of about 55 ppm (parts per million) of copper, whereas copper ore deposits must contain about 5,000 ppm (0.5%) copper before we can mine them. Thus, geologic processes need to concentrate the average copper content of the crust by about 100 times to make a copper ore deposit that we can use. We then use industrial processes to convert copper ore into pure copper metal, an increase of about 200 times. By a fortunate coincidence, elements and materials that we use in large amounts need less natural concentration than those that we use in small amounts. Thus, we are likely to have larger deposits of mineral commodities that we use in large amounts. As long as energy costs remain high, the relation between work that we can afford to do and work that we expect nature to do will control the lower limit of natural concentrations that we can exploit, and this puts very real limits on our global mineral resources.",
		"Car-sharing is now a familiar concept, but creative companies are making it possible for their clients to share ownership and access to just about everything, such as villas, handbags and even diamond necklaces. According to a Portuguese saying, “You should never have a yacht; you should have a friend with a yacht.” By joining a yacht sharing service, members can live the Portuguese dream by sharing a yacht with up to seven other people. In describing the service, a recent newspaper article warned consumers that sharing the yacht means “there is no guarantee you will always be able to use it when you want.” This apparent limitation is precisely what helps consumers make it a treat. Limiting your access to everything from sandwiches to luxury cars helps to reset your cheerometer. That is, knowing you can’t have access to something all the time may help you appreciate it more when you do.",
		"The problem of amino acid deficiency is not unique to the modern world by any means. Preindustrial humanity probably dealt with protein and amino acid insufficiency on a regular basis. Sure, large hunted animals such as mammoths provided protein and amino acids aplenty. However, living off big game in the era before refrigeration meant humans had to endure alternating periods of feast and famine. Droughts, forest fires, superstorms, and ice ages led to long stretches of difficult conditions, and starvation was a constant threat. The human inability to synthesize such basic things as amino acids certainly worsened those crises and made surviving on whatever was available that much harder. During a famine, it’s not the lack of calories that is the ultimate cause of death; it’s the lack of proteins and the essential amino acids they provide.",
		"Charisma is eminently learnable and teachable, and in many ways, it follows one of Newton’s famed laws of motion: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.  That is to say that all of charisma and human interaction is a set of signals and cues that lead to other signals and cues, and there is a science to deciphering which signals and cues work the most in your favor. In other words, charisma can often be simplified as a checklist of what to do at what time. However, it will require brief forays out of your comfort zone. Even though there may be a logically easy set of procedures to follow, it’s still an emotional battle to change your habits and introduce new, uncomfortable behaviors that you are not used to.I like to say that it’s just a matter of using muscles that have long been dormant. It will take some time to warm them up, but it’s only through practice and action that you will achieve your desired goal.",
		"In the US, regional styles of speech have always been associated with regional styles of building: the Midwestern farmhouse, the Southern plantation mansion, and the Cape Cod cottage all have their equivalent in spoken dialect. These buildings may be old and genuine, or they may be recent reproductions, the equivalent of an assumed rather than a native accent. As James Kunstler says, “half-baked versions of Scarlett O’Hara’s Tara now stand replicated in countless suburban subdivisions around the United States.\" In some cities and towns, especially where tourism is an important part of the economy, zoning codes may make a sort of artificial authenticity compulsory. Houses in the historic district of Key West, Florida, for example, whether new or remodeled, must be built of wood in a traditional style, and there are only a few permissible colors of paint, white being preferred. From the street these houses may look like the simple sea captains’ mansions they imitate. Inside, however, where zoning does not reach, they often contain modern lighting and state-of-the-art kitchens and bathrooms.",
		"It can be helpful to read your own essay aloud to hear how it sounds, and it can sometimes be even more beneficial to hear someone else read it. Either reading will help you to hear things that you otherwise might not notice when editing silently. If you feel uncomfortable having someone read to you, however, or if you simply don’t have someone you can ask to do it, you can have your computer read your essay to you. Granted, it’s not quite the same thing, and the computer is not going to tell you when something doesn’t “sound right.” The computer also won’t stumble over things that are awkward—it will just plow right on through. But hearing the computer read your writing is a very different experience from reading it yourself. If you have never tried it, you might find that you notice areas for revision, editing, and proofreading that you didn’t notice before.",
		"Open international online access is understood using the metaphor “flat earth.” It represents a world where information moves across the globe as easily as a hockey puck seems to slide across an ice rink’s flat surface. This framework, however, can be misleading―especially if we extend the metaphor. As anyone who has crossed an ice rink can confirm, just because the surface of the rink appears flat and open does not necessarily mean that surface is smooth or even. Rather, such surfaces tend to be covered by a wide array of dips and cracks and bumps that create a certain degree of pull or drag or friction on any object moving across it. In much the same way, an array of technological, political, economic, cultural, and linguistic factors can exist and create a similar kind of pull or drag or friction. They affect how smoothly or directly information can move from point to point in global cyberspace. Thus, while the earth might appear to be increasingly flat from the perspective of international online communication, it is far from frictionless.",
		"Hubert Cecil Booth is often credited with inventing the first powered mobile vacuum cleaner. In fact, he only claimed to be the first to coin the term “vacuum cleaner” for devices of this nature, which may explain why he is so credited. As we all know, the term “vacuum” is an inappropriate name, because there exists no vacuum in a vacuum cleaner. Rather, it is the air moving through a small hole into a closed container, as a result of air being blown out of the container by a fan on the inside. But I suppose a “rapid air movement in a closed container to create suction” cleaner would not sound as scientific or be as handy a name. Anyway, we are stuck with it historically, and it is hard to find any references to “vacuum” prior to Booth. Interestingly, Booth himself did not use the term “vacuum” when he filed a provisional specification describing in general terms his intended invention.",
		"In physics, the principle of relativity requires that all equations describing the laws of physics have the same form regardless of inertial frames of reference. The formulas should appear identical to any two observers and to the same observer in a different time and space. Attitudes and values, however, are subjective to begin with, and therefore they are easily altered to fit our ever­changing circumstances and goals. Thus, the same task can be viewed as boring one moment and engaging the next. Divorce, unemployment, and cancer can seem devastating to one person but be perceived as an opportunity for growth by another person, depending on whether or not the person is married, employed, and healthy. It is not only beliefs, attitudes, and values that are subjective. Our brains comfortably change our perceptions of the physical world to suit our needs. We will never see the same event and stimuli in exactly the same way at different times.",
		"You are in a train, standing at a station next to another train. Suddenly you seem to start moving. But then you realize that you aren’t actually moving at all. It is the second train that is moving in the opposite direction. The illusion of relative movement works the other way, too. You think the other train has moved, only to discover that it is your own train that is moving. It can be hard to tell the difference between apparent movement and real movement. It’s easy if your train starts with a jolt, of course, but not if your train moves very smoothly. When your train overtakes a slightly slower train, you can sometimes fool yourself into thinking your train is still and the other train is moving slowly backwards.",
		"You’re probably already starting to see the tremendous value of network analysis for businesspeople. In the business world, information is money: a tip about anything from a cheap supplier to a competitor’s marketing campaign to an under­the­table merger discussion can inform strategic decisions that might yield millions of dollars in profits. You might catch it on TV or in the newspaper, but that’s information everyone knows. The most profitable information likely comes through network connections that provide “inside” information. And it isn’t just information that travels through network connections―it’s influence as well. If you have a connection at another company, you can possibly ask your connection to push that company to do business with yours, to avoid a competitor, or to hold off on the launch of a product. So clearly, any businessperson wants to increase their personal network.",
		"Moringa is a plant that ranges in height from five to twelve meters with an open, umbrella shaped crown, straight trunk. Native to a tropical climate, this leafy tree can survive almost anywhere in the world. Clusters of white flowers are produced from this tree, which then develop into long narrow seed pods. The fruits(pods) are initially light green, slim and tender, eventually becoming dark green, firm and up to 120 cm long, depending on the variety. Moringa cures malnutrition, contains over­the­top quantities of a host of vitamins and minerals. The dried powdered leaves were found to contain seventeen times the calcium of milk, nine times the protein of yogurt, and twenty­five times the iron in spinach.",
		"Short­horned lizards are small, flat, round lizards that have short, stubby horns. They are found in the deserts and semi­arid environments of North and Central America. During hot weather, they are most active during the morning hours and less active in the afternoon. Short­horned lizards prefer soft, sandy soils, near rocks where they can blend in with the background. They can quickly burrow into loose soil to hide. Their color varies from red­brown to yellow­grey, depending upon their surroundings, since their color provides them with camouflage. Their underside is white or light gray, without spots. When threatened, they are capable of blowing up their bodies up to twice their normal size. And if this proves insufficient, they shoot blood from their eyes to confuse their predators. The blood can travel a distance of up to three feet.",
		"In 2004, an eighteen­year­old competitive swimmer, Brian Boyle, had to be brought back to life eight times after a dump truck slammed into his car on his way home from swim practice. The force of the horrific crash damaged every major organ in his body. Doctors predicted he would not survive, let alone walk again. But, miraculously, Brian clawed his way back to the living and gradually recovered. In 2007, Brian Boyle staged what many consider to be one of the greatest comebacks in sports history when he crossed the finish line at the Hawaii Ironman just three years after leaving the Intensive Care Unit. In 2009, he published his first book, Iron Heart, and he was presented the Spokesperson of the Year Award from the American Red Cross for his contributions. In 2010, he graduated Cum Laude from St. Mary’s College of Maryland, and also made his very first blood donation at the hospital that brought him back to life. Brian now dedicates his life to competing in triathlons and giving back to the donors who saved him.",
		"From your brain’s perspective, your body is just another source of sensory input. Sensations from your heart and lungs, your metabolism, your changing temperature, and so on, are like ambiguous blobs. These purely physical sensations inside your body have no objective psychological meaning. Once your concepts enter the picture, however, those sensations may take on additional meaning. If you feel an ache in your stomach while sitting at the dinner table, you might experience it as hunger. If flu season is just around the corner, you might experience that same ache as nausea. If you are a judge in a courtroom, you might experience the ache as a gut feeling that the defendant cannot be trusted. In a given moment, in a given context, your brain uses concepts to give meaning to internal sensations as well as to external sensations from the world, all simultaneously. From an aching stomach, your brain constructs an instance of hunger, nausea, or mistrust.",
		"Several animal species help other injured animals survive. Dolphins need to reach the surface of the water to breathe. If a dolphin is wounded so severely that it cannot swim to the surface by itself, other dolphins group themselves under it, pushing it upward to the air. If necessary, they will keep doing this for several hours. The same kind of thing happens among elephants. A fallen elephant is likely to have difficulty breathing because of its own weight, or it may overheat in the sun. Many elephant experts have reported that when an elephant falls down, other members of the group try to raise it to its feet.",
		"I’ll bet that if you’re in the habit of buying the morning paper, you skip the one directly on top of the pile. Instead, you lift up the top newspaper and pull out the one directly underneath it. Did you know that consciously or not, 72 percent of people do the same? Why? Because we imagine that the second one from the top hasn’t been handled by countless fingertips and is therefore somehow cleaner than the one above it. Ironically, though, after scanning the headlines, many of that same 72 percent of consumers replace that paper right where they found it, under the top one. So they all end up thumbing through the same newspaper that has been touched over and over.",
		"It’s true that before puberty, kids don’t gain the same muscle from lifting weights that a teen or adult would, but Dr. Avery Faigenbaum, a noted youth exercise specialist, points to studies in which children as young as six have benefited from strength training and says that, on average, kids show a 30 to 40 percent strength gain when they start lifting for the first time. Muscles aren’t the only goal, of course; various studies have also shown that kids who weight‒train have healthier bone density, body composition, and even resistance to injury. The risk of injury is, of course, one reason parents worry about kids and weights, but as long as the little bodybuilders are properly supervised to prevent overtraining and possible injury, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the President’s Council on Fitness say the rewards outweigh the risks.",
		"Across the developing world today, the “mobile health” revolution―mobile phones used as tools for healthcare―is responsible for a number of improvements. Mobile phones are now used to connect patients to doctors, to monitor drug distribution, and to share basic health information that isn’t available locally. Mobile phones are tools to send reminders about medication and appointments to patients. The central problems of health sectors in poor places―clinics without enough staff, patients in remote places, too few medications or inefficient distribution of them, and misinformation about vaccines and disease prevention―will all find at least partial solutions through connectivity.",
		"When you skip breakfast, you are like a car trying to run without fuel. Experts say that a nutritious breakfast is the brain’s fuel. A brain that is fully fueled concentrates better and solves problems faster. Some students say that getting a few extra minutes of sleep is more important than eating a bowl of oatmeal, but they’re wrong. Of course, sleeping is important, but going to bed a half­hour earlier would be better than sleeping late and skipping breakfast. For students who want to do well in school, breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Give your brain the fuel it needs to run well. To think more clearly and faster, eat a good breakfast.",
		"Have you been abroad? Do you travel a lot? Then you know what I’m talking about. Wherever you go on this globe, you can get along with English. Either most people speak it anyhow, or there is at least somebody around who can communicate in this language. But then, you realize that mostly there’s something you may find odd about the way English is used there. If you are abroad, English is likely to be somewhat different from the way you speak it. Well, if you stay there, wherever that is, for a while, you’ll get used to this. And if you stay there even longer, you may even pick up some of these features and begin to sound like the locals. What this example teaches us is:English is no longer just “one language.”",
		"Science fiction involves much more than shiny robots and fantastical spaceships. In fact, many of the most outlandish pieces of science fiction have their basis in scientific facts. Because a great deal of science fiction is rooted in science, it can be used to bring literature out of the English classroom and into the science classroom. Not only does science fiction help students see scientific principles in action, but it also builds their critical thinking and creative skills. As students read a science fiction text, they must connect the text with the scientific principles they have learned. Students can read a science fiction text and a non­fiction text covering similar ideas and compare and contrast the two. Students can also build their creative skills by seeing scientific principles used in a different way, possibly creating science fiction stories of their own or imagining new ways to apply the knowledge and skills they have learned.",
		"Storing medications correctly is very important because many drugs will become ineffective if they are not stored properly. The bathroom medicine cabinet is not a good place to keep medicine because the room’s moisture and heat speed up the chemical breakdown of drugs. Storing medication in the refrigerator is also not a good idea because of the moisture inside the unit. Some easily spoiled drugs do require refrigeration, but these should be labeled as needing to be kept in the refrigerator. Light and air can also affect drugs, but dark bottles and air-tight caps can keep these effects to a minimum. A closet is probably your best bet for storage of your medications, as long as you keep them out of the reach of children.",
		"Hydroelectric power is a clean and renewable power source. However, there are a few things about dams that are important to know. To build a hydroelectric dam, a large area must be flooded behind the dam. Whole communities sometimes have to be moved to another place. Entire forests can be drowned. The water released from the dam can be colder than usual and this can affect the ecosystems in the rivers downstream. It can also wash away riverbanks and destroy life on the river bottoms. The worst effect of dams has been observed on salmon that have to travel upstream to lay their eggs. If blocked by a dam, the salmon life cycle cannot be completed.",
		"When you face a severe source of stress, you may fight back, reacting immediately. While this served your ancestors well when they were attacked by a wild animal, it is less helpful today unless you are attacked physically. Technology makes it much easier to worsen a situation with a quick response. I know I have been guilty of responding too quickly to people, on email in particular, in a harsh tone that only made things worse. The more something causes your heart to race, the more important it is to step back before speaking or typing a single word. This will give you time to think things through and find a way to deal with the other person in a healthier manner.",
		"One day after the space shuttle Challenger exploded, Ulric Neisser asked a class of 106 students to write down exactly where they were when they heard the news. Two and a half years later, he asked them the same question. In that second interview, 25 percent of the students gave completely different accounts of where they were. Half had significant errors in their answers and less than 10 percent remembered with any real accuracy. Results such as these are part of the reason people make mistakes on the witness stand when they are asked months later to describe a crime they witnessed. Between 1989 and 2007, 201 prisoners in the United States were proven innocent on the basis of DNA evidence. Seventy­five percent of those prisoners had been declared guilty on the basis of mistaken eyewitness accounts.",
		"One might wonder whether there is any reason to be concerned about overconfidence in students. After all, confidence is often considered a positive trait. Indeed, research suggests that students who are confident about their ability to succeed in school tend to perform better on academic tests than those with less confidence. That said, negative consequences also stem from being too confident in the classroom. Students who are overconfident about their ability to succeed in college end up feeling more disconnected and disillusioned than those with more modest expectations. Overconfidence can also leave students with mistaken impressions that they are fully prepared for tests and no longer need to study. Students who have relatively accurate perceptions regarding their progress in learning tend to use more effective study habits and perform better on tests than do those with more error-prone views of their knowledge.",
		"Noise in the classroom has negative effects on communication patterns and the ability to pay attention. Thus, it is not surprising that constant exposure to noise is related to children’s academic achievement, particularly in its negative effects on reading and learning to read. Some researchers found that, when preschool classrooms were changed to reduce noise levels, the children spoke to each other more often and in more complete sentences, and their performance on prereading tests improved. Research with older children suggests similar findings. On reading and math tests, elementary and high school students in noisy schools or classrooms consistently perform below those in quieter settings.",
		"Have you ever wondered why a dog doesn’t fall over when he changes directions while running? When a dog is running and has to turn quickly, he throws the front part of his body in the direction he wants to go. His back then bends, but his hind part will still continue in the original direction. Naturally, this turning movement might result in the dog’s hind part swinging wide. And this could greatly slow his rate of movement or even cause the dog to fall over as he tries to make a high-speed turn. However, the dog’s tail helps to prevent this. Throwing his tail in the same direction that his body is turning serves to reduce the tendency to spin off course.",
		"Shopping for new gadgets, clothes, or just random junk can turn into a hobby in itself. If you’d rather save your money, try finding pleasure in creating things rather than buying things. We get the same kind of satisfaction from making things that we do from buying things. If you draw something you’re proud of or write something you enjoy, you’ve now got a new thing in your life that makes you happy. Buying a new gadget might give you a similar rush, but it’s also probably more temporary. Of course, our recommendation can cost money, too. However, when you can’t spend money, you can always learn more about your craft online or practice with what you already have. Even if you end up spending money making things yourself, you’re at least building a skill rather than a collection of stuff that’s quickly decreasing in value.",
		"Sometimes, we are fascinated when our assumptions are turned inside out and around. The artist Pablo Picasso, for example, used Cubism as a way to help us see the world differently. In his famous work Three Musicians, he used abstract forms to shape the players in such an unexpected way that when you first see this artwork, you assume that nothing makes sense. Yet when you look at the painting a second time, the figures come together. Picasso’s work challenges your assumptions about how space and objects are used. His artwork helps you see the world differently and reminds you there are alternative ways of using shape, objects, and colors. The reward for this is the intrinsic pleasure you get by looking at this work.",
		"Storyteller Syd Lieberman suggests that it is the story in history that provides the nail to hang facts on. Students remember historical facts when they are tied to a story. According to a report, a high school in Boulder, Colorado, is currently experimenting with a study of presentation of historical material. Storytellers present material in dramatic context to the students, and group discussion follows. Students are encouraged to read further. In contrast, another group of students is involved in traditional research/report techniques. The study indicates that the material presented by the storytellers has much more interest and personal impact than that gained via the traditional method.",
		"Human beings are driven by a natural desire to form and maintain interpersonal relationships. From this perspective, people seek relationships with others to fill a fundamental need, and this need underlies many emotions, actions, and decisions throughout life. Probably, the need to belong is a product of human beings’ evolutionary history as a social species. Human beings have long depended on the cooperation of others for the supply of food, protection from predators, and the acquisition of essential knowledge. Without the formation and maintenance of social bonds, early human beings probably would not have been able to cope with or adapt to their physical environments. Thus, seeking closeness and meaningful relationships has long been vital for human survival.",
		"Fast fashion refers to trendy clothes designed, created, and sold to consumers as quickly as possible at extremely low prices. Fast fashion items may not cost you much at the cash register, but they come with a serious price: tens of millions of people in developing countries, some just children, work long hours in dangerous conditions to make them, in the kinds of factories often labeled sweatshops. Most garment workers are paid barely enough to survive. Fast fashion also hurts the environment. Garments are manufactured using toxic chemicals and then transported around the globe, making the fashion industry the world’s second­largest polluter, after the oil industry. And millions of tons of discarded clothing piles up in landfills each year.",
		"When we read a number, we are more influenced by the leftmost digit than by the rightmost, since that is the order in which we read, and process, them. The number 799 feels significantly less than 800 because we see the former as 7-something and the latter as 8-something, whereas 798 feels pretty much like 799. Since the nineteenth century, shopkeepers have taken advantage of this trick by choosing prices ending in a 9, to give the impression that a product is cheaper than it is. Surveys show that around a third to two-thirds of all retail prices now end in a 9. Though we are all experienced shoppers, we are still fooled. In 2008, researchers at the University of Southern Brittany monitored a local pizza restaurant that was serving five types of pizza at €8.00 each. When one of the pizzas was reduced in price to €7.99, its share of sales rose from a third of the total to a half.",
		"While some sand is formed in oceans from things like shells and rocks, most sand is made up of tiny bits of rock that came all the way from the mountains! But that trip can take thousands of years. Glaciers, wind, and flowing water help move the rocky bits along, with the tiny travelers getting smaller and smaller as they go. If they’re lucky, a river may give them a lift all the way to the coast. There, they can spend the rest of their years on the beach as sand.",
		"If you’ve ever seen a tree stump, you probably noticed that the top of the stump had a series of rings. These rings can tell us how old the tree is, and what the weather was like during each year of the tree’s life. Because trees are sensitive to local climate conditions, such as rain and temperature, they give scientists some information about that area’s local climate in the past. For example, tree rings usually grow wider in warm, wet years and are thinner in years when it is cold and dry. If the tree has experienced stressful conditions, such as a drought, the tree might hardly grow at all during that time. Very old trees in particular can offer clues about what the climate was like long before measurements were recorded.",
		"Social relationships benefit from people giving each other compliments now and again because people like to be liked and like to receive compliments. In that respect, social lies such as making deceptive but flattering comments (“I like your new haircut.”) may benefit mutual relations. Social lies are told for psychological reasons and serve both self­interest and the interest of others. They serve self­interest because liars may gain satisfaction when they notice that their lies please other people, or because they realize that by telling such lies they avoid an awkward situation or discussion. They serve the interest of others because hearing the truth all the time (“You look much older now than you did a few years ago.”) could damage a person’s confidence and self­esteem.",
		"You can say that information sits in one brain until it is communicated to another, unchanged in the conversation. That’s true of sheer information, like your phone number or the place you left your keys. But it’s not true of knowledge. Knowledge relies on judgements, which you discover and polish in conversation with other people or with yourself. Therefore you don’t learn the details of your thinking until speaking or writing it out in detail and looking back critically at the result. “Is what I just said foolish, or is what I just wrote a deep truth?” In the speaking or writing, you uncover your bad ideas, often embarrassing ones, and good ideas too, sometimes fame-making ones. Thinking requires its expression.",
		"Although individual preferences vary, touch (both what we touch with our fingers and the way things feel as they come in contact with our skin) is an important aspect of many products. Consumers like some products because of their feel. Some consumers buy skin creams and baby products for their soothing effect on the skin. In fact, consumers who have a high need for touch tend to like products that provide this opportunity. When considering products with material properties, such as clothing or carpeting, consumers like goods they can touch in stores more than products they only see and read about online or in catalogs.",
		"Like anything else involving effort, compassion takes practice. We have to work at getting into the habit of standing with others in their time of need. Sometimes offering help is a simple matter that does not take us far out of our way―remembering to speak a kind word to someone who is down, or spending an occasional Saturday morning volunteering for a favorite cause. At other times, helping involves some real sacrifice. “A bone to the dog is not charity,” Jack London observed. “Charity is the bone shared with the dog, when you are just as hungry as the dog.” If we practice taking the many small opportunities to help others, we’ll be in shape to act when those times requiring real, hard sacrifice come along.",
		"Animals as well as humans engage in play activities. In animals, play has long been seen as a way of learning and practicing skills and behaviors that are necessary for future survival. In children, too, play has important functions during development. From its earliest beginnings in infancy, play is a way in which children learn about the world and their place in it. Children’s play serves as a training ground for developing physical abilities―skills like walking, running, and jumping that are necessary for everyday living. Play also allows children to try out and learn social behaviors and to acquire values and personality traits that will be important in adulthood. For example, they learn how to compete and cooperate with others, how to lead and follow, how to make decisions, and so on.",
		"The use of renewable sources of energy to produce electricity has increasingly been encouraged as a way to harmonize the need to secure electricity supply with environmental protection objectives. But the use of renewable sources also comes with its own consequences, which require consideration. Renewable sources of energy include a variety of sources such as hydropower and ocean-based technologies. Additionally, solar, wind, geothermal and biomass renewable sources also have their own impact on the environment. Hydropower dams, for example, have an impact on aquatic ecosystems and, more recently, have been identified as significant sources of greenhouse emissions. Wind, solar, and biomass also cause negative environmental impacts, such as visual pollution, intensive land occupation and negative effects on bird populations.",
		"When two people are involved in an honest and open conversation, there is a back and forth flow of information. It is a smooth exchange. Since each one is drawing on their past personal experiences, the pace of the exchange is as fast as memory. When one person lies, their responses will come more slowly because the brain needs more time to process the details of a new invention than to recall stored facts. As they say, “Timing is everything.” You will notice the time lag when you are having a conversation with someone who is making things up as they go. Don’t forget that the other person may be reading your body language as well, and if you seem to be disbelieving their story, they will have to pause to process that information, too.",
		"Curiosity makes us much more likely to view a tough problem as an interesting challenge to take on. A stressful meeting with our boss becomes an opportunity to learn. A nervous first date becomes an exciting night out with a new person. A colander becomes a hat. In general, curiosity motivates us to view stressful situations as challenges rather than threats, to talk about difficulties more openly, and to try new approaches to solving problems. In fact, curiosity is associated with a less defensive reaction to stress and, as a result, less aggression when we respond to irritation.",
		"Vegetarian eating is moving into the mainstream as more and more young adults say no to meat, poultry, and fish. According to the American Dietetic Association, “approximately planned vegetarian diets are healthful, are nutritionally adequate, and provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.” But health concerns are not the only reason that young adults give for changing their diets. Some make the choice out of concern for animal rights. When faced with the statistics that show the majority of animals raised as food live in confinement, many teens give up meat to protest those conditions. Others turn to vegetarianism to support the environment. Meat production uses vast amounts of water, land, grain, and energy and creates problems with animal waste and resulting pollution.",
		"We used to think that the brain never changed, but according to the neuroscientist Richard Davidson, we now know that this is not true―specific brain circuits grow stronger through regular practice. He explains, “Well-being is fundamentally no different than learning to play the cello. If one practices the skills of well-being, one will get better at it.” What this means is that you can actually train your brain to become more grateful, relaxed, or confident, by repeating experiences that evoke gratitude, relaxation, or confidence. Your brain is shaped by the thoughts you repeat. The more neurons fire as they are activated by repeated thoughts and activities, the faster they develop into neural pathways, which cause lasting changes in the brain. Or in the words of Donald Hebb, “Neurons that fire together wire together.” This is such an encouraging premise: bottom line―we can intentionally create the habits for the brain to be happier.",
		"The whole of human society operates on knowing the future weather. For example, farmers in India know when the monsoon rains will come next year and so they know when to plant the crops. Farmers in Indonesia know there are two monsoon rains each year, so next year they can have two harvests. This is based on their knowledge of the past, as the monsoons have always come at about the same time each year in living memory. But the need to predict goes deeper than this; it influences every part of our lives. Our houses, roads, railways, airports, offices, and so on are all designed for the local climate. For example, in England all the houses have central heating, as the outside temperature is usually below 20°C, but no air­conditioning, as temperatures rarely go beyond 26°C, while in Australia the opposite is true: most houses have air­conditioning but rarely central heating.",
		"Every day, children explore and construct relationships among objects. Frequently, these relationships focus on how much or how many of something exists. Thus, children count ―“One cookie, two shoes, three candles on the birthday cake, four children in the sandbox.” Children compare― “Which has more? Which has fewer? Will there be enough?” Children calculate―“How many will fit? Now, I have five. I need one more.” In all of these instances, children are developing a notion of quantity. Children reveal and investigate mathematical concepts through their own activities or experiences, such as figuring out how many crackers to take at snack time or sorting shells into piles.",
		"For creatures like us, evolution smiled upon those with a strong need to belong. Survival and reproduction are the criteria of success by natural selection, and forming relationships with other people can be useful for both survival and reproduction. Groups can share resources, care for sick members, scare off predators, fight together against enemies, divide tasks so as to improve efficiency, and contribute to survival in many other ways. In particular, if an individual and a group want the same resource, the group will generally prevail, so competition for resources would especially favor a need to belong. Belongingness will likewise promote reproduction, such as by bringing potential mates into contact with each other, and in particular by keeping parents together to care for their children, who are much more likely to survive if they have more than one caregiver.",
		"The most remarkable and unbelievable consequence of melting ice and rising seas is that together they are a kind of time machine, so real that they are altering the duration of our day. It works like this: As the glaciers melt and the seas rise, gravity forces more water toward the equator. This changes the shape of the Earth ever so slightly, making it fatter around the middle, which in turns slows the rotation of the planet similarly to the way a ballet dancer slows her spin by spreading out her arms. The slowdown isn’t much, just a few thousandths of a second each year, but like the barely noticeable jump of rising seas every year, it adds up. When dinosaurs lived on the Earth, a day lasted only about twenty-three hours.",
		"As the social and economic situation of countries got better, wage levels and working conditions improved. Gradually people were given more time off. At the same time, forms of transport improved and it became faster and cheaper to get to places. England’s industrial revolution led to many of these changes. Railways, in the nineteenth century, opened up now famous seaside resorts such as Blackpool and Brighton. With the railways came many large hotels. In Canada, for example, the new coast­to­coast railway system made possible the building of such famous hotels as Banff Springs and Chateau Lake Louise in the Rockies. Later, the arrival of air transport opened up more of the world and led to tourism growth.",
		"We tend to believe that we possess a host of socially desirable characteristics, and that we are free of most of those that are socially undesirable. For example, a large majority of the general public thinks that they are more intelligent, more fair­minded, less prejudiced, and more skilled behind the wheel of an automobile than the average person. This phenomenon is so reliable and ubiquitous that it has come to be known as the “Lake Wobegon effect,” after Garrison Keillor’s fictional community where “the women are strong, the men are good­looking, and all the children are above average.” A survey of one million high school seniors found that 70% thought they were above average in leadership ability, and only 2% thought they were below average. In terms of ability to get along with others, all students thought they were above average, 60% thought they were in the top 10%, and 25% thought they were in the top 1%!",
		"The interaction of workers from different cultural backgrounds with the host population might increase productivity due to positive externalities like knowledge spillovers. This is only an advantage up to a certain degree. When the variety of backgrounds is too large, fractionalization may cause excessive transaction costs for communication, which may lower productivity. Diversity not only impacts the labour market, but may also affect the quality of life in a location. A tolerant native population may value a multicultural city or region because of an increase in the range of available goods and services. On the other hand, diversity could be perceived as an unattractive feature if natives perceive it as a distortion of what they consider to be their national identity. They might even discriminate against other ethnic groups and they might fear that social conflicts between different foreign nationalities are imported into their own neighbourhood.",
		"Nearly everything has to go through your mouth to get to the rest of you, from food and air to bacteria and viruses. A healthy mouth can help your body get what it needs and prevent it from harm―with adequate space for air to travel to your lungs, and healthy teeth and gums that prevent harmful microorganisms from entering your bloodstream. From the moment you are created, oral health affects every aspect of your life. What happens in the mouth is usually just the tip of the iceberg and a reflection of what is happening in other parts of the body. Poor oral health can be a cause of a disease that affects the entire body. The microorganisms in an unhealthy mouth can enter the bloodstream and travel anywhere in the body, posing serious health risks.",
		"Crop rotation is the process in which farmers change the crops they grow in their fields in a special order. For example, if a farmer has three fields, he or she may grow carrots in the first field, green beans in the second, and tomatoes in the third. The next year, green beans will be in the first field, tomatoes in the second field, and carrots will be in the third. In year three, the crops will rotate again. By the fourth year, the crops will go back to their original order. Each crop enriches the soil for the next crop. This type of farming is sustainable because the soil stays healthy.",
		"Sports involve your brain as much as your body: you have to understand plays, see the field and know your next move, block out the crowd, and concentrate on your performance. You also need to control anxiety and negative thoughts. It takes practice to develop these mental skills, which is no different from the development of physical skills. Dr. Alan Goldberg, a sports psychologist, says that most performance problems that athletes struggle with are not a result of inadequate coaching or a lack of physical skills or technical ability. When the heat of competition is turned up, the individual performer or team that falls apart most often does so because of mental factors like poor concentration, negativity, lack of confidence, or an inability to let go of mistakes.",
		"Many cities are finding that artificial wetlands provide a low­cost way to filter and treat outflowing sewage. Arcata, California, for instance, needed an expensive sewer plant upgrade. Instead, the city transformed a 65 hectare garbage dump into a series of ponds and marshes that serve as a simple, low­cost, waste treatment facility. Arcata saved millions of dollars and improved its environment simultaneously. The marsh is a home for wildlife and has become a prized recreation area for the city. Eventually, the purified water from the artificial wetlands flows into Humboldt Bay, where marine life flourishes. Constructed marshes allow industrial cooling water to become clean before entering streams or other surface water bodies. All these created wetlands can be useful to both humans and wildlife.",
		"You’re buying a used car, moving into a new apartment, or determining which doctor should treat your cancer. These are times when you need to get directly to the core of an issue. “Asking general questions gets you little valuable information, and may even yield misleading responses,” says Julia Minson, a scholar at the University of Pennsylvania. The best way is to ask probing questions that suppose there are problems. Let’s say someone is selling a used music player. An example of a general question is “What can you tell me about it?” A positive­assumption question is “There aren’t any problems with it, right?” But a negative­assumption question such as “What problems have you had with it?” will get the most honest response.",
		"You probably know that you can’t tickle yourself. Although you might be able to tickle a total stranger, your brain also strongly discourages you from doing something so socially awkward. These facts offer insight into tickling’s evolutionary purpose, says Robert R. Provine, the author of the book Laughter: A Scientific Investigation. Tickling, he says, is partly a mechanism for social bonding between close companions and helps strengthen relationships between family members and friends. Laughter in response to tickling kicks in during the first few months of life. “It’s one of the first forms of communication between babies and their caregivers,” Provine says. The face­to­face activity also opens the door for other interactions.",
		"There is an important difference between having an ideal and making a rule to live by. The ideal may be a perfect and flawless standard that one would be proud to attain. Such an ideal provides you with a guide, but it should not be a daily standard. Making the ideal into a rule is digging oneself a trap. If you constantly fall into the trap, you feel so bad about yourself that it becomes increasingly hard to keep going. The rule needs to be clear, and to direct you toward the ideal if that is what you want, but it also needs to be realistic, if it is not to undermine your self-esteem. That is why it makes more sense to do the best you can―rather than aim for perfection.",
		"Emotions usually get a bad reputation. They are often seen as something to be regulated or managed. People even think emotions are harmful if they get out of control. However, all emotions have a point. They played an important part in our evolutionary history and helped us survive. For example, by seeing disgust on someone’s face when presented with moldy food, we were able to avoid eating something dangerous. By communicating happiness, we were able to develop beneficial social interactions. Even anger was an important emotion to our ancestors, motivating us to seek food when we were hungry, to fight off predators and to compete for scarce resources.",
		"No Stone Age ten­year­old would have been living on tender foods like modern potato chips, hamburgers, and pasta. Their meals would have required far more chewing than is ever demanded of a modern child. Insufficient use of jaw muscles in the early years of modern life may result in their underdevelopment and in weaker and smaller bone structure. The growth of human teeth requires a jaw structure of a certain size and shape, one that might not be produced if usage during development is inadequate. Crowded and misplaced incisors and imperfect wisdom teeth may be diseases of civilization. Perhaps many dental problems would be prevented if more biting were encouraged for children.",
		"Popular prejudice offers a black­and­white picture of the brain versus body paradigm. We are often told that exercise develops the body while reading, writing, and thinking are meant to develop the brain. This is a flawed perception. While mental activities such as reading, writing, solving mathematical problems, doing crosswords or participating in seminars are primarily concerned with the brain, they are also relevant to the body and have an impact on it. The emotions and sensory reactions created by these activities have an influence, however subtle, through chemical signals, on the body and its health.",

		"Drinking water can contribute to good health, and schools are in a unique position to promote healthy dietary behaviors, including drinking sufficient water. More than 95% of children and adolescents are enrolled in schools, and students typically spend at least 6 hours at school each day. Ensuring that students have access to safe, free drinking water throughout the school environment gives them a healthy substitute for sugar­sweetened beverages. Access to clean and free water helps to increase students’ overall water consumption, maintain hydration, and reduce unhealthy calories intake. Adequate hydration may improve cognitive function among children and adolescents, which is important for learning.",
		"The first humans who figured out how to write things down around 5,000 years ago were in essence trying to increase the capacity of their hippocampus, part of the brain’s memory system. They effectively extended the natural limits of human memory by preserving some of their memories on clay tablets and cave walls, and later, papyrus and parchment. Later, we developed other mechanisms― such as calendars, filing cabinets, computers, and smartphones―to help us organize and store the information we’ve written down. When our computer or smartphone starts to run slowly, we might buy a larger memory card. That memory is both a metaphor and a physical reality. We are off­loading a great deal of the processing that our neurons would normally do to an external device that then becomes an extension of our own brains, a neural enhancer.",
		"The extraordinary expansion of food production by aquafarming has come with high costs to the environment and human health. As with industrialized agriculture, most commercial aquafarming relies on high energy and chemical inputs, including antibiotics and artificial feeds made from the wastes of poultry processing. Such production practices tend to concentrate toxins in farmed fish, creating a potential health threat to consumers. The discharge from fish farms, which can be equivalent to the sewage from a small city, can pollute nearby natural aquatic ecosystems. Around the tropics, especially tropical Asia, the expansion of commercial shrimp farms is contributing to the loss of highly biodiverse coastal mangrove forests.",
		"Advertising experts have learned that the commercials that we remember will hook us into a story. Think about some of the most memorable and effective advertisements of all time, whether in the form of a printed page or 30­second spot on television. They involved an impressive storyline. Apple Computer’s classic “Think Different” campaign is widely considered the best ad of all time because it so dramatically told a powerful story. Coca Cola’s “Mean Joe Green” commercial is another example of a story, in which a little boy meets his hero. The goal in all these scenarios is to move people, emotionally and personally, creating a close association with the product that is positive and familiar.",
		"In some sense, tea played a life­changing role for herdsmen and hunters after it spread to China’s grasslands and pasture lands. It is often said that people make a living according to given circumstances. On high mountains and grasslands in the northwest part of China, a large quantity of cattle, sheep, camels, and horses are raised. The milk and meat provide people with much fat and protein but few vitamins. Tea, therefore, supplements the basic needs of the nomadic tribes, whose diet lacks vegetables. Therefore, the herdsmen from the Qinghai­Tibet Plateau, the Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia autonomous regions follow the tea culture system in which they drink tea with milk. And they make milky tea the most precious thing for the people in the northwest part of China.",
		"The cultural ideas spread by empire were seldom the exclusive creation of the ruling elite. Since the imperial vision tends to be universal and inclusive, it was relatively easy for imperial elites to adopt ideas, norms, and traditions from wherever they found them, rather than to stick to a single rigid tradition. While some emperors sought to purify their cultures and return to what they viewed as their roots, for the most part empires have produced hybrid civilizations that absorbed much from their subject peoples. The imperial culture of Rome was Greek almost as much as Roman. Imperial Mongol culture was a Chinese copycat. In the imperial United States, an American president of Kenyan blood can eat Italian pizza while watching his favorite film, Lawrence of Arabia, a British epic about the Arab rebellion against the Turks.",
		"Poetry sharpens our senses and makes us more keenly and fully aware of life. Imagine, for a moment, that you are trying to describe one of your friends. You could say the friend is tall, has blue eyes, a mole on the left cheek, or a red nose. But that would only describe the outside of this person. It wouldn’t tell people what your friend is really like―the habits, feelings, all the little peculiarities that make this person what he or she is and different from everyone else. You would find it very difficult indeed to describe the inside of your friend, even though you feel you know such a great friend through and through. Now good poetry does describe life in that way; it tells us about its inside as well as its outside, and thus it helps you to know and love the world as intimately as you know and love a friend.",
		"The word sin itself is an interesting concept. It’s actually a term from archery, and it means “to miss the mark.” When we commit the “sin” of failing to take care of our bodies through proper nutrition, exercise, and rest, we’re missing the mark of what life is all about. Businesspeople will tell you that the individual who is in the best physical shape often wins in negotiations, because he has the physical stamina to see the deal through. One of the reasons world­class golfers are head and shoulders above the other golfers of their era is that they are in so much better shape than the others are. They work out not just on the practice range but in the weight room, which means that they have the strength and stamina to win not just the physical game but the mental game in order to close out their opponents in major tournaments.",
		"How can we access the nutrients we need with less impact on the environment? The most significant component of agriculture that contributes to climate change is livestock. Globally, beef cattle and milk cattle have the most significant impact in terms of greenhouse gas emissions(GHGEs), and are responsible for 41% of the world’s CO emissions and 2 20% of the total global GHGEs. The atmospheric increases in GHGEs caused by the transport, land clearance, methane emissions, and grain cultivation associated with the livestock industry are the main drivers behind increases in global temperatures. In contrast to conventional livestock, insects as “minilivestock” are low-GHGE emitters, use minimal land, can be fed on food waste rather than cultivated grain, and can be farmed anywhere thus potentially also avoiding GHGEs caused by long distance transportation. If we increased insect consumption and decreased meat consumption worldwide, the global warming potential of the food system would be significantly reduced.",
		"Many parents who have experienced personal hardship desire a better life for their children. To want to spare children from having to go through unpleasant experiences is a noble aim, and it naturally stems from love and concern for the child. What these parents don’t realize, however, is that while in the short term they may be making the lives of their children more pleasant, in the long term they may be preventing their children from acquiring self­confidence, mental strength, and important interpersonal skills. Samuel Smiles, a nineteenth­century English author, wrote, “It is doubtful whether any heavier curse could be forced on man than the complete gratification of all his wishes without effort on his part, leaving nothing for his hopes, desires, or struggles.” For healthy development, the child needs to deal with some failure, struggle through some difficult periods, and experience some painful emotions.",
		"The trio of freeze, flight, and fight are fairly universal behavioral defensive reactions in mammals and other vertebrate species. But some species have other options available, such as playing dead, which is also called tonic immobility. Like freezing, this behavior can help prevent attack, but whereas in freezing muscles are contracted and poised to be used in fight or flight, in tonic immobility the muscles of the body are relaxed. Another such response is defensive burying: Rodents will use their paws and head to shovel dirt toward an aversive stimulus. Other behavioral options include making loud noises, retreating into a shell, rolling into a tight ball, choosing to live in a predator-free area such as underground, or relying on safety in numbers by living in a group.",
		"The public growth of the Internet began in the 1990s, as increasing numbers of computers came into homes and workplaces. The first online newspaper was published in the US and the Chicago­based Tribunewas among the first titles to put its content online, in 1991. As the decade progressed, software developments made the task of creating online content quicker and cheaper—between 1995 and 1998, the number of US dailies on the web grew from 175 to 750. Newspapers in the UK followed the same pattern: in 1994, the Sunday Timesbecame the UK’s first newspaper to have an online edition and a few months later the Daily Telegraph launched the Electronic Telegraph, Europe’s first online daily.",
		"The development of writing was pioneered not by gossips, storytellers, or poets, but by accountants. The earliest writing system has its roots in the Neolithic period, when humans first began to switch from hunting and gathering to a settled lifestyle based on agriculture. This shift began around 9500 B.C. in a region known as the Fertile Crescent, which stretches from modern‑day Egypt, up to southeastern Turkey, and down again to the border between Iraq and Iran. Writing seems to have evolved in this region from the custom of using small clay pieces to account for transactions involving agricultural goods such as grain, sheep, and cattle. The first written documents, which come from the Mesopotamian city of Uruk and date back to around 3400 B.C., record amounts of bread, payment of taxes, and other transactions using simple symbols and marks on clay tablets.",
		"Although we don’t know the full neurological effects of digital technologies on young children’s development, we do know that all screen time is not created equal. For example, reading an e­book, videoconferencing with grandma, or showing your child a picture you just took of them is not the same as the passive, television­watching screen time that concerns many parents and educators. So, rather than focusing on how much children are interacting with screens, parents and educators are turning their focus instead to what children are interacting with and who is talking with them about their experiences. Though parents may be tempted to hand a child a screen and walk away, guiding children’s media experiences helps them build important 21st Century skills, such as critical thinking and media literacy.",
		"It turns out that the secret behind our recently extended life span is not due to genetics or natural selection, but rather to the relentless improvements made to our overall standard of living. From a medical and public health perspective, these developments were nothing less than game changing. For example, major diseases such as smallpox, polio, and measles have been eradicated by mass vaccination. At the same time, better living standards achieved through improvements in education, housing, nutrition, and sanitation systems have substantially reduced malnutrition and infections, preventing many unnecessary deaths among children. Furthermore, technologies designed to improve health have become available to the masses, whether via refrigeration to prevent spoilage or systemized garbage collection, which in and of itself eliminated many common sources of disease. These impressive shifts have not only dramatically affected the ways in which civilizations eat, but also determined how civilizations will live and die.",
		"The practice of medicine has meant the average age to which people in all nations may expect to live is higher than it has been in recorded history, and there is a better opportunity than ever for an individual to survive serious disorders such as cancers, brain tumors and heart diseases. However, longer life spans mean more people, worsening food and housing supply difficulties. In addition, medical services are still not well distributed, and accessibility remains a problem in many parts of the world. Improvements in medical technology shift the balance of population (to the young at first, and then to the old). They also tie up money and resources in facilities and trained people, costing more money, and affecting what can be spent on other things.",
		"In this world, being smart or competent isn’t enough. People sometimes don’t recognize talent when they see it. Their vision is clouded by the first impression we give and that can lose us the job we want, or the relationship we want. The way we present ourselves can speak more eloquently of the skills we bring to the table, if we actively cultivate that presentation. Nobody likes to be crossed off the list before being given the opportunity to show others who they are. Being able to tell your story from the moment you meet other people is a skill that must be actively cultivated, in order to send the message that you’re someone to be considered and the right person for the position. For that reason, it’s important that we all learn how to say the appropriate things in the right way and to present ourselves in a way that appeals to other people― tailoring a great first impression.",
		"The original idea of a patent, remember, was not to reward inventors with monopoly profits, but to encourage them to share their inventions. A certain amount of intellectual property law is plainly necessary to achieve this. But it has gone too far. Most patents are now as much about defending monopoly and discouraging rivals as about sharing ideas. And that disrupts innovation. Many firms use patents as barriers to entry, suing upstart innovators who trespass on their intellectual property even on the way to some other goal. In the years before World War I, aircraft makers tied each other up in patent lawsuits and slowed down innovation until the US government stepped in. Much the same has happened with smartphones and biotechnology today. New entrants have to fight their way through “patent thickets” if they are to build on existing technologies to make new ones.",
		"Our world today is comparatively harmless. We don’t have to be careful every moment that a tiger is behind us. We do not have to worry about starving. Our dangers today are, for example, high blood pressure or diabetes. To be clear, we have a Stone Age brain that lives in a modern world. Because of this, many situations are considered a threat by our brains, although they are harmless to our survival. In the past, danger meant we either had to flee or fight. If we have an appointment but are stuck in a traffic jam, that does not really threaten our lives. However, our brain considers this a danger. That is the point. There is no danger, but our brain rates it as such. If we have an unpleasant conversation with our partner, it does not threaten our lives, and we do not have to flee or fight. The danger is an illusion. Our Stone Age brain sees a mortal danger that is not there.",
		"In addition to the varied forms that recreation may take, it also meets a wide range of individual needs and interests. Many participants take part in recreation as a form of relaxation and release from work pressures or other tensions. Often they may be passive spectators of entertainment provided by television, movies, or other forms of electronic amusement. However, other significant play motivations are based on the need to express creativity, discover hidden talents, or pursue excellence in varied forms of personal expression. For some participants, active, competitive recreation may offer a channel for releasing hostility and aggression or for struggling against others or the environment in adventurous, high­risk activities. Others enjoy recreation that is highly social and provides the opportunity for making new friends or cooperating with others in group settings.",
		"A child whose behavior is out of control improves when clear limits on their behavior are set and enforced. However, parents must agree on where a limit will be set and how it will be enforced. The limit and the consequence of breaking the limit must be clearly presented to the child. Enforcement of the limit should be consistent and firm. Too many limits are difficult to learn and may spoil the normal development of autonomy. The limit must be reasonable in terms of the child’s age, temperament, and developmental level. To be effective, both parents (and other adults in the home) must enforce limits. Otherwise, children may effectively split the parents and seek to test the limits with the more indulgent parent. In all situations, to be effective, punishment must be brief and linked directly to a behavior.",
		"It has long been held that the capacity for laughter is a peculiarly human characteristic. The witty Lucian of Samosata (2nd century A.D.) noted that the way to distinguish a man from a donkey is that one laughs and the other does not. In all societies humor is important not only in individual communication but also as a molding force of social groups, reinforcing their norms and regulating behavior. “Each particular time, each era, in fact each moment, has its own condition and themes for laughter...... because of the major preoccupations, concerns, interests, activities, relations, and mode prevailing at the time.” The ultimate goal of anyone who studies another culture, such as ancient Greece, is to understand the people themselves who were more than the sum total of monuments, historical incidents, or social groupings. One way to approach this goal directly is to study the culture’s humor. As Goethe aptly observed: “Men show their characters in nothing more clearly than in what they think laughable.”",
		"I was brought up to believe that if I get lost in a large forest, I will sooner or later end up where I started. Without knowing it, people who are lost will always walk in a circle. In the book Finding Your Way Without Map or Compass, author Harold Gatty confirms that this is true. We tend to walk in circles for several reasons. The most important is that virtually no human has two legs of the exact same length. One leg is always slightly longer than the other, and this causes us to turn without even noticing it. In addition, if you are hiking with a backpack on, the weight of that backpack will inevitably throw you off balance. Our dominant hand factors into the mix too. If you are right-handed, you will have a tendency to turn toward the right. And when you meet an obstacle, you will subconsciously decide to pass it on the right side.",
		"Before the modern scientific era, creativity was attributed to a superhuman force; all novel ideas originated with the gods. After all, how could a person create something that did not exist before the divine act of creation? In fact, the Latin meaning of the verb “inspire” is “to breathe into,” reflecting the belief that creative inspiration was similar to the moment in creation when God first breathed life into man. Plato argued that the poet was possessed by divine inspiration, and Plotin wrote that art could only be beautiful if it descended from God. The artist’s job was not to imitate nature but rather to reveal the sacred and transcendent qualities of nature. Art could only be a pale imitation of the perfection of the world of ideas. Greek artists did not blindly imitate what they saw in reality; instead they tried to represent the pure, true forms underlying reality, resulting in a sort of compromise between abstraction and accuracy.",
		"Creativity is a step further on from imagination. Imagination can be an entirely private process of internal consciousness. You might be lying motionless on your bed in a fever of imagination and no one would ever know. Private imaginings may have no outcomes in the world at all. Creativity does. Being creative involves doing something. It would be odd to describe as creative someone who never did anything. To call somebody creative suggests they are actively producing something in a deliberate way. People are not creative in the abstract; they are creative in something: in mathematics, in engineering, in writing, in music, in business, in whatever. Creativity involves putting your imagination to work. In a sense, creativity is applied imagination.",
		"Many marine species including oysters, marsh grasses, and fish were deliberately introduced for food or for erosion control, with little knowledge of the impacts they could have. Fish and shellfish have been intentionally introduced all over the world for aquaculture, providing food and jobs, but they can escape and become a threat to native species, ecosystem function, or livelihoods. Atlantic salmon are reared in ocean net­pens in Washington State and British Columbia. Many escape each year, and they have been recovered in both saltwater and freshwater in Washington State, British Columbia, and Alaska. Recreational fishing can also spread invasive species. Bait worms from Maine are popular throughout the country. They are commonly packed in seaweed which contains many other organisms. If the seaweed is discarded, it or the organisms on it can colonize new areas. Fishing boots, recreational boats, and trailers can pick up organisms at one location and move them elsewhere.",
		"Shutter speed refers to the speed of a camera shutter. In behavior profiling, it refers to the speed of the eyelid. When we blink, we reveal more than just blink rate. Changes in the speed of the eyelid can indicate important information; shutter speed is a measurement of fear. Think of an animal that has a reputation for being fearful. A Chihuahua might come to mind. In mammals, because of evolution, our eyelids will speed up to minimize the amount of time that we can’t see an approaching predator. The greater the degree of fear an animal is experiencing, the more the animal is concerned with an approaching predator. In an attempt to keep the eyes open as much as possible, the eyelids involuntarily speed up. Speed, when it comes to behavior, almost always equals fear. In humans, if we experience fear about something, our eyelids will do the same thing as the Chihuahua; they will close and open more quickly.",
		"Individual human beings differ from one another physically in a multitude of visible and invisible ways. If races—as most people define them—are real biological entities, then people of African ancestry would share a wide variety of traits while people of European ancestry would share a wide variety of different traits. But once we add traits that are less visible than skin coloration, hair texture, and the like, we find that the people we identify as “the same race” are less and less like one another and more and more like people we identify as “different races.” Add to this point that the physical features used to identify a person as a representative of some race (e.g. skin coloration) are continuously variable, so that one cannot say where “brown skin” becomes “white skin.” Although the physical differences themselves are real, the way we use physical differences to classify people into discrete races is a cultural construction.",
		"In the movie Groundhog Day, a weatherman played by Bill Murray is forced to re­live a single day over and over again. Confronted with this seemingly endless loop, he eventually rebels against living through the same day the same way twice. He learns French, becomes a great pianist, befriends his neighbors, helps the poor. Why do we cheer him on? Because we don’t want perfect predictability, even if what’s on repeat is appealing. Surprise engages us. It allows us to escape autopilot. It keeps us awake to our experience. In fact, the neurotransmitter systems involved in reward are tied to the level of surprise: rewards delivered at regular, predictable times yield a lot less activity in the brain than the same rewards delivered at random unpredictable times. Surprise gratifies.",
		"We have already seen that learning is much more efficient when done at regular intervals: rather than cramming an entire lesson into one day, we are better off spreading out the learning. The reason is simple: every night, our brain consolidates what it has learned during the day. This is one of the most important neuroscience discoveries of the last thirty years: sleep is not just a period of inactivity or a garbage collection of the waste products that the brain accumulated while we were awake. Quite the contrary: while we sleep, our brain remains active; it runs a specific algorithm that replays the important events it recorded during the previous day and gradually transfers them into a more efficient compartment of our memory.",
		"Native Americans often sang and danced in preparation for launching an attack. The emotional and neurochemical excitement that resulted from this preparatory singing gave them stamina to carry out their attacks. What may have begun as an unconscious, uncontrolled act—rushing their victims with singing and beating drums in a frenzy—could have become a strategy as the victors saw firsthand the effect their actions had on those they were attacking. Although war dances risk warning an enemy of an upcoming attack, the arousal and synchronizing benefits for the attackers may compensate for the loss of surprise. Humans who sang, danced, and marched may have enjoyed a strong advantage on the battlefield as well as intimidated enemies who witnessed such a spectacle. Nineteenth-and twentieth-century Germans feared no one more than the Scots—the bagpipes and drums were disturbing in their sheer loudness and visual spectacle.",
		"What consequences of eating too many grapes and other sweet fruit could there possibly be for our brains? A few large studies have helped to shed some light. In one, higher fruit intake in older, cognitively healthy adults was linked with less volume in the hippocampus. This finding was unusual, since people who eat more fruit usually display the benefits associated with a healthy diet. In this study, however, the researchers isolated various components of the subjects’ diets and found that fruit didn’t seem to be doing their memory centers any favors. Another study from the Mayo Clinic saw a similar inverse relationship between fruit intake and volume of the cortex, the large outer layer of the brain. Researchers in the latter study noted that excessive consumption of high‑sugar fruit (such as mangoes, bananas, and pineapples) may cause metabolic and cognitive problems as much as processed carbs do.",
		"Education must focus on the trunk of the tree of knowledge, revealing the ways in which the branches, twigs, and leaves all emerge from a common core. Tools for thinking stem from this core, providing a common language with which practitioners in different fields may share their experience of the process of innovation and discover links between their creative activities. When the same terms are employed across the curriculum, students begin to link different subjects and classes. If they practice abstracting in writing class, if they work on abstracting in painting or drawing class, and if, in all cases, they call it abstracting, they begin to understand how to think beyond disciplinary boundaries. They see how to transform their thoughts from one mode of conception and expression to another. Linking the disciplines comes naturally when the terms and tools are presented as part of a universal imagination.",
		"If cooking is as central to human identity, biology, and culture as the biological anthropologist Richard Wrangham suggests, it stands to reason that the decline of cooking in our time would have serious consequences for modern life, and so it has. Are they all bad? Not at all. The outsourcing of much of the work of cooking to corporations has relieved women of what has traditionally been their exclusive responsibility for feeding the family, making it easier for them to work outside the home and have careers. It has headed off many of the domestic conflicts that such a large shift in gender roles and family dynamics was bound to spark. It has relieved other pressures in the household, including longer workdays and overscheduled children, and saved us time that we can now invest in other pursuits. It has also allowed us to diversify our diets substantially, making it possible even for people with no cooking skills and little money to enjoy a whole different cuisine. All that’s required is a microwave.",
		"Sylvan Goldman invented the shopping cart and introduced it in his stores in 1937. It was an excellent device that would make it easy for shoppers to buy as much as they wanted without getting tired or seeking others’ help. But Goldman discovered that in spite of his repeated advertisements and explanations, he could not persuade his shoppers to use the wheeled carts. Men were reluctant because they thought they would appear weak if they pushed such carts instead of carrying their shopping. Women wouldn’t touch them because the carts reminded them of baby carriages. It was only a few elderly shoppers who used them. That made the carts even less attractive to the majority of the shoppers. Then Goldman hit upon an idea. He hired several models, men and women, of different ages and asked them to wheel the carts in the store and shop. A young woman employee standing near the entrance told the regular shoppers, ‘Look, everyone is using the carts. Why don’t you?’ That was the turning point. A few shills disguised as regular shoppers easily accomplished what logic, explanations, and advertisements failed to do. Within a few weeks shoppers readily accepted those carts.",
		"Empathy is frequently listed as one of the most desired skills in an employer or employee, although without specifying exactly what is meant by empathy. Some businesses stress cognitive empathy, emphasizing the need for leaders to understand the perspective of employees and customers when negotiating deals and making decisions. Others stress affective empathy and empathic concern, emphasizing the ability of leaders to gain trust from employees and customers by treating them with real concern and compassion. When some consultants argue that successful companies foster empathy, what that translates to is that companies should conduct good market research. In other words, an “empathic” company understands the needs and wants of its customers and seeks to fulfill those needs and wants. When some people speak of design with empathy, what that translates to is that companies should take into account the specific needs of different populations —the blind, the deaf, the elderly, non­English speakers, the color­blind, and so on—when designing products.",
		"Our essentially subtropical body isn’t well suited to life in the Arctic because we don’t have the fur of polar bears or the thick, insulating fat of sea mammals. But we can make fur clothing, shelters to contain warmth, and weapons with which to hunt and defend ourselves. These items are good examples of cultural adaptation, which show how culture is used to survive the natural world. Keep in mind, though, that people must also survive the cultural world they inhabit, and that is just as important. For example, if you don’t greet your neighbors the right way, you may cause bad feelings; in the same way, your grandfather may not appreciate your elaborate, back-slapping handshake the way your buddy does. So although culture does help you survive the natural world, it also tells you how to survive the cultural world of social interactions.",
		"When our minds are at ease, we’re more likely to direct the spotlight of attention inward, toward the stream of remote associations coming from the right hemisphere of our brains. In contrast, when we are diligently focused, our attention tends to be directed outward, toward the details of the problems we’re trying to solve. While this pattern of attention is necessary when solving problems analytically, it actually prevents us from detecting the connections that lead to creative insights. “That’s why so many insights happen during warm showers,” Subhra Bhattacharya, a well-known psychologist, says. “For many people, it’s the most relaxing part of the day.” It’s not until we’re being massaged by warm water, unable to check our e-mail, that we’re finally able to hear the quiet voices in the backs of our heads telling us about the insight.",
		"Recently, researchers have suggested that the purpose of laughter is not just to communicate that one is in a playful state, but to actually induce this state in others as well. According to this view, the peculiar sounds of laughter have a direct effect on the listener, inducing positive emotional arousal that mirrors the emotional state of the laugher, perhaps by activating certain specialized brain circuits. In this way, laughter may serve an important biosocial function of coupling together the positive emotions of members of a group and thereby coordinating their activities. This would explain why laughter is so infectious; when we hear someone laughing, it is almost impossible not to feel cheerful and begin laughing too.",
		"People’s preferences affect decisions about consumption and trade. Not only is there variation in preference across people, but there also is variation based on how much has already been consumed. For example, you might get a lot of pleasure from drinking a cup of coffee in the morning, and be willing to trade $3 for that coffee. But, after finishing that first cup of coffee, the second cup of coffee might not be quite as valuable to you. At some point, you will have had so much coffee that you’re not willing to part with $3 to get another cup. Economists often use the generic term “utility” to refer to the pleasure, value, or usefulness of something that is consumed or experienced. In this example, then, you are making a decision about whether the utility of another cup of coffee is greater than the utility of having $3 to spend on something else.",
		"Textiles and clothing have functions that go beyond just protecting the body. Dress and textiles alike are used as a means of nonverbal communication. Obvious examples would be the use of uniforms to communicate a particular social role and the modern white wedding dress Western cultures use to mark this rite of passage. Both types of clothing communicate important information nonverbally to the onlooker. The female wearing the white dress is about to be married and change her status and role in society. The person in the uniform has some specialized function in society, such as police officer, nurse, or soldier. Therefore, it can be said that clothing visually communicates information about group membership and functions as an identity marker.",
		"There are a variety of currents in the oceans, and because they move and mix the water they will influence various aspects of the environment. One especially important environmental impact of currents is that they can move nutrients from deep water to the surface, where these nutrients can be used by plants, in the photosynthetic process, to produce organic matter. Currents can also disperse waste products, eggs, larvae, and adult life­forms. Some fish lay their eggs in or near a current, which may then carry the eggs and young into an environment favorable for growth. By mixing ocean water, currents keep water­temperature changes to a minimum. Turbulence caused by currents adds oxygen to the water―oxygen that fish need.",
		"Soil erosion is not new. What is new is the rate of erosion. New soil forms when the weathering of rock exceeds losses from erosion. Throughout most of the earth’s geological history, the result was a gradual, long­term buildup of soil that could support vegetation. The vegetation in turn reduced erosion and facilitated the accumulation of topsoil. At some recent point in history, this relationship was reversed—with soil losses from wind and water erosion exceeding new soil formation. The world now is losing soil at a rate of billions of tons per year, and this is reducing the earth’s productivity. In many countries, the loss of soil is decreasing the productivity of the land.",
		"Researcher Jack Greenberg studied how employees from various career sectors perceived their performance evaluation. He found that, regardless of the industry, it was incredibly important for employees to feel that they were active participants in the evaluation process. The employees were more likely to feel that the process was fair when supervisors requested their input prior to an evaluation and used it during the process, when there was two­way communication during the evaluation interviews, and when the employees had the chance to challenge the evaluation. In other words, if the employees were involved in their evaluation, they felt it was fairer.",
		"Unlike books and paintings, music speaks to us through a re-creator, a musician who makes the printed music sound. A composition, even a familiar one, can be a new experience each time it’s performed. It is the job of the performer to bring life to the printed symbols laid out by a composer. Just how loud is a chord marked ? How fast is a section labeled allegro? No matter how many specific indications of rhythm, dynamics, or accent appear on a page, much is left to the performer. Like that of an actor, his or her interpretation is full of subtle timings and inflections. Performers project to an audience a mixture of their own feelings and the composer’s intentions. Critics sometimes say about a particularly convincing interpretation that a performer is ‘identified’ with a work and its composer. That’s how close the relationship can be.",
		"Tourism is important for more than just vacationing. Tourism allows people from different places and cultures to come together, and then tourists and host communities learn about each other’s differences and similarities. They also learn new tastes and ways of thinking, which may lead to a better understanding between hosts and tourists. Another positive effect of tourism is the aid it provides for the survival of a society’s culture, especially the culture’s art forms. The opportunity to sell native artworks to tourists or perform folk dances for them may encourage local artists to preserve traditional art forms. For example, Fijians have developed their palm mat and shell jewelry crafts into profitable tourist businesses. They also earn additional income by performing folk dances and fire walking.",
		"Having positive relationships with peers can lead directly to resources and information that help students learn. By virtue of the fact that they are socially accepted, it is reasonable to assume that students who get along with their peers will also have access to peer resources that can promote the development of social and academic competencies. These resources can take the form of information and advice, modeled behavior, or specific experiences that facilitate learning. Teachers play the central pedagogical function of transmitting knowledge and training students in academic subject areas. However, students provide each other with valuable resources necessary to accomplish academic tasks. Students frequently clarify and interpret their teacher’s instructions concerning what they should be doing and how they should do it, provide mutual assistance in the form of volunteering substantive information and answering questions, and share various supplies such as pencils and paper.",
		"A business incubator is, quite simply, a building that is divided into units of space, which are then leased to early‒stage small businesses. The result is a collection of offices and small warehouses filled with businesses that have one thing in common: they are businesses in the early stages of development. Each of the businesses has problems and needs that are similar, and each is in need of a variety of help, ranging from technical assistance to shared business opportunities to a simple pat on the back. Business incubators are not intended to provide permanent homes to their client businesses but rather to provide them with a temporary nurturing environment, until such time as the business is financially healthy. Upon reaching more predictable profitability, the incubated business can then be expected to “graduate” and move on to a typical office or warehouse building.",
		"Do you have the emotional state of mind to become a leader? People pay close attention to a leader’s subtle expressions of emotion through body language and facial expression. Some emotions such as enthusiasm can quickly become contagious. Others, such as depression or discouragement, can drag down the entire organization. Leaders with positive emotional states of mind are like human magnets. People naturally gravitate to them and want to follow them. Such leaders inspire enthusiasm in their organizations and attract the best people to work for them. Conversely, leaders who emit negative emotional states of mind, who are irritable and bossy, repel people and have few followers.",
		"The human species and human culture evolved through interaction with the entire communities of animals and plants. Of the two great influences that make humans what they are, heredity and environment, environment is undoubtedly the more powerful. After all, heredity itself encodes the results of millions of years of environmental influences on the human genome. Even genetic mutations are, to some extent, caused by environmental factors. Evolution is largely the result of natural selection that takes place because humans, during their history of development as a species, have been part of biotic communities in which their interactions with other species of animals and plants have decided whether or not they survived and reproduced.",
		"Tradition is a critical element that cannot be ignored in the creation of architecture. Tradition is the essential element that allows a new work to connect with people on an emotional and intellectual level. The recollection of the familiar is one aspect of design that produces pleasure. This feeling of pleasure or satisfaction exists because we enjoy a sense of security among things that we know and understand. References to a previous tradition are a common component of most major architectural movements. While these movements utilized new technologies and building materials, or invented new building forms, each evoked an emotional response having its roots in an earlier tradition.",
		"Work was once seen as human penance for evil beginnings in the Garden of Eden. Over the years, as socioeconomic classes arose in society in the Middle Ages, work began to be seen as the curse of the poor. The wealthy in society did all they could to avoid labor, perhaps except for war, which was seen as noble. Eventually enlightened philosophers such as St. Thomas Aquinas and his contemporaries taught that work was important, especially if we used our surplus to help others. Their teachings influenced reformers such as Martin Luther, who explained that work was virtuous if we had integrity and were honest in our dealings with our fellow men. Later, as America and Canada expanded into new territories, work in contemporary society was described as a privilege of the free. Then, as we entered the 1900s, Henry Ford and other industrialists convinced us that work led to progress for our society and our families.",
		"When we hear a story, we look for beliefs that are being commented upon. Any story has many possible beliefs inherent in it. But how does someone listening to a story find those beliefs? We find them by looking through the beliefs we already have. We are not as concerned with what we are hearing as we are with finding what we already know that is relevant. Picture it in this way. As understanders, we have a list of beliefs, indexed by subject area. When a new story appears, we attempt to find a belief of ours that relates to it. When we do, we find a story attached to that belief and compare the story in our memory to the one we are processing. Our understanding of the new story becomes, at that point, a function of the old story. Once we find a belief and connected story, we need no further processing; that is, the search for other beliefs stops.",
		"Customers often focus on product specifications, giving interviewers detailed instructions on particular design characteristics: size, weight, color, shape, look, or feel. Razor users may request “a wider handle” or “a lighter weight” or “a shiny look.” By accepting this input from customers, companies assume that the customer knows the best solution ―which is often not the case. A wider handle, for example, may have been requested to prevent the razor from slipping out of the user’s hand while shaving. Although a wider handle may be helpful in solving the problem, a better option might be a regular­size handle with a ribbed, rubberized grip. Although this type of feedback may be appropriate in certain situations, accepting specifications as customer inputs inherently prevents engineers and designers from using their creative skills to devise breakthrough products and services.",
		"From an evolutionary perspective, fear has contributed to both fostering and limiting change, and to preserving the species. We are programmed to be afraid. It is a survival need, as is stability, which is another force of nature that can limit the capacity to change. Stable patterns are necessary lest we live in chaos; however, they make it difficult to abandon entrenched behaviors, even those that are no longer useful, constructive, or health creating. And fear can keep you from changing when you don’t want to risk a step into unknown territory; for example, some people choose not to leave an unfulfilling job or a failing relationship because they fear the unknown more than the known. On the other hand, fear can also motivate change in order to avoid something you’re afraid of, such as dying young―as one of your parents might have.",
		"Not just information but also people may move between societies, taking their knowledge and cultural practices with them. Like war, migration is an ancient phenomenon and very common throughout history. Although it is often regarded with suspicion, immigration tends to confer benefits on the host group. In recent history, countries with the highest net inward migration have also had the highest growth rates, the two factors clearly being linked in harmony. The complaint that immigrants take people’s jobs is, like similar complaints about technology, based on an erroneously static view of the world. In fact, immigrants increase the size of the market and thus create jobs. Furthermore, they arrive as already productive adults having never been dependent on the host country. They also tend to be motivated and intelligent individuals with a talent for the creation of economic organization.",
		"Deposits of oil lie under the frozen ground, or tundra, of Alaska. Scientists and engineers have the technology needed to get this oil out of the ground and move it across the state through pipelines. Some people support drilling for Alaska’s oil and moving it over the land in pipes. Other people fear that digging into the tundra will be harmful to the environment. They also fear that above­ground pipelines and spilled oil may harm the plants and animals in the region. People who are opposed to drilling in Alaska don’t want to take the benefits of having more oil with the potential bad effects on the environment. Other people feel that this tradeoff is worth the benefits it will give to the community, or to the country as a whole. Still others say new technology should be developed to reduce the dangers to the environment before drilling is allowed.",
		"One of the reasons for difficulty in achieving one’s optimal weight is poor nutrient timing. When you eat is almost as important as what you eat, because the same nutrients have different effects on the body when consumed at different times. The body’s energy needs change throughout the day. It’s important to concentrate your food intake during those times when your body’s energy needs are greatest and not to consume more calories than your body needs to meet its immediate energy needs at any time. When you consume calories at times of peak energy need, most of them are used to fuel your muscles and nervous system, to synthesize muscle tissue, and to replenish muscle fuel stores. When you consume more calories than you need at any time, those excess calories will be stored as body fat.",
		"It is a strategic and tactical mistake to give an offensive position away to those who will use it to attack, criticize, and blame. Since opponents will undoubtedly attack, criticize, and blame, anyway, the advantages of being proactive, airing one’s own “dirty laundry,” and “telling on oneself” are too significant to ignore. Chief among these advantages is the ability to control the first messages and how a story is first framed. That leaves others having to respond to you instead of the other way around. This approach is appropriately termed “stealing thunder.” When an organization steals thunder, it breaks the news about its own crisis before the crisis is discovered by the media or other interested parties. In experimental research by Arpan and Roskos-Ewoldsen, stealing thunder in a crisis situation, as opposed to allowing the information to be first disclosed by another party, resulted in substantially higher credibility ratings. As significant, the authors found that “credibility ratings associated with stealing thunder directly predicted perceptions of the crisis as less severe.”",
		"In the drama of the theater, suspense follows a predictable recipe. Suspense occurs when well­liked main characters struggle to overcome obstacles and cope triumphantly with threats and dangers to their well­being. Such events occasion hopes and fears in the audience―hopes for positive outcomes and fears of negative outcomes to the liked persons. Suspense thrives on hopes and fears. Seeing the hero battle obstacles and overcome crises engages the viewer in an emotional struggle in which the drama’s storyline and its conclusion events carry an emotional impact that would otherwise be missing. For instance, we feel little curiosity upon watching a Pony Express rider deliver mail at the next outpost, but we feel great curiosity via suspense if that same rider is a Western hero who loses his horse to a hostile environment, overcomes rattlesnake bites, outsmarts evil­minded outlaws, and otherwise fights his way triumphantly to the next outpost.",
		"Some psychologists believe that insight is the result of a restructuring of a problem after a period of non-progress where the person is believed to be too focused on past experience and get stuck. A new manner to represent the problem is suddenly discovered, leading to a different path to a solution heretofore unpredicted. It has been claimed that no specific knowledge, or experience is required to attain insight in the problem situation. As a matter of fact, one should break away from experience and let the mind wander freely. Nevertheless, experimental studies have shown that insight is actually the result of ordinary analytical thinking. The restructuring of a problem can be caused by unsuccessful attempts in solving the problem, leading to new information being brought in while the person is thinking. The new information can contribute to a completely different perspective in finding a solution, thus producing the Aha! Experience.",
		"Birds, as a whole group, are more sensitive to changes in their environment than other animals, so when they start falling off perches we should all be troubled. They are in the forward­most trench of nature’s resistance against the relentless attrition of environmental degradation. Our birds are nature’s early warning system and the scientists are telling us that if we don’t start acting on their distress signals, it won’t be long before the rest of the animal world is overrun as well. The populations of many species are declining rapidly because habitats are being destroyed or undermined, food sources are disappearing and, tricked by the increasingly weird and unstable weather, the birds’ migration and breeding patterns are changing. In short, birds are confused and under stress. Just because you can hear your robins, goldfinches, and sparrows chirping away happily in the garden every morning, don’t be fooled into thinking that all is well in ‘birdworld’.",
		"During the last two decades many developing countries have joined the global tourism market as part of globalization processes and the fall of the Iron Curtain. These countries had suffered from negative public and media image which made it challenging for them to compete over tourists with countries with strong and familiar brands. In this global era, a problematic image is a major obstacle in attracting tourists, high­quality residents and investors. However, in the case of destinations suffering from prolonged image crises, it seems almost unrealistic to expect any target audience to visit a destination and “put aside” these long­lasting negative images and stereotypes, just because of an advertising campaign or other promotional effort. Tackling prolonged negative place images is crucial for developing tourism in Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, Eastern Europe and Asia. Although these destinations differ greatly, in the eyes of many potential tourists they all suffer from weak place images, negative stereotypes and problematic perceptions.",
		"Some city planning experts called for legislation against texting while walking that would be followed by a deep change of norms. This recommendation is based on the assumption that this change is welcomed, but laws banning texting while walking failed in Toronto, Arkansas, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey and New York. Meanwhile, high-tech firms are developing technological solutions to the problem, offering a transparent screen that allows pedestrians to see what is going on in front of them while texting. Another direction for adaptation to the problem was provided by city councils via better urban planning and interventions to generate awareness. Some towns and college campuses have put ‘look up’ signs in dangerous stairwells and intersections. Hong Kong added announcements in its subway system recommending that passengers look around; New York City reduced speeds for cars, and San Francisco fosters pedestrian-only corridors.",
		"The term “biological control” has been used, at times, in a broad context to cover a full spectrum of biological organisms and biologically based products. This has been spectacularly successful in many instances, with a number of pest problems permanently resolved by importation and successful establishment of natural enemies. These importation successes have been limited largely to certain types of ecosystems and/or pest situations such as introduced pests in perennial ecosystems. On the other hand, this approach has met with limited success for major pests of row crops or other ephemeral systems. In these situations, the problem is often not the lack of effective natural enemies but management practices and a lack of concerted research on factors that determine the success or failure of importation attempts in the specific agro-ecosystem setting. Thus, importation programs, to date, are largely a matter of trial and error based on experience of the individual specialists involved.",
		"1950s critics separated themselves from the masses by rejecting the ‘natural’ enjoyment afforded by products of mass culture through judgments based on a refined sense of realism. For example, in most critics championing Douglas Sirk’s films’ social critique, self-reflexivity, and, in particular, distancing effects, there is still a refusal of the ‘vulgar’ enjoyments suspected of soap operas. This refusal again functions to divorce the critic from an image of a mindless, pleasure-seeking crowd he or she has actually manufactured in order to definitively secure the righteous logic of ‘good’ taste. It also pushes negative notions of female taste and subjectivity. Critiques of mass culture seem always to bring to mind a disrespectful image of the feminine to represent the depths of the corruption of the people. The process of taste-making operated, then, to create hierarchical differences between the aesthete and the masses through the construction of aesthetic positions contrary to the perceived tasteless pleasures of the crowd.",
		"Considering the multitude of ways people benefit from insects, it is curious that insects continue to suffer from such an unfavorable reputation. Ironically, while many of us perceive insects as harmful pests―dangerous, ugly, and disease­ridden―in reality, without the service of pollination which they provide humankind might cease to exist. The promotion of negative stereotypes of insects can be largely traced to failure by Europeans to appreciate or understand the customs of the lands they colonized and their misperception that the way of life of most indigenous populations they encountered was barbaric. Many people’s dislike for insects stems from a similar classist attitude that associates insects with indigenous people who lack the means to buy or grow alternate sources of food. Again this prejudice stems largely from Western cultures. In contrast, cultures of many Eastern nations such as Japan and China consider various species of insects to be great delicacies.",
		"In the “good old days,” you earned positive feedback slowly through good deeds or other accomplishments. With the advent of social media, our children become impatient for an immediate answer or “Like” within minutes of sending that urgent piece of information out, as a text to one person, a group, the hundreds of “friends” they’ve amassed, or the entire world. “I just have to check again to see if anyone has responded, yet.” Every positive response gives a small drop of dopamine right into the brain’s reward center. Even more powerfully, neuroimaging studies reveal that the anticipation of a reward is more stimulating than its actual receipt. Plus, the reward from each response is not enough to be totally satisfying, leaving you still hungry for more― another feature of addictive behavior. Thus, the dopamine reward of the instant feedback contributes to the time spent on social media.",
		"Good architecture and good engineering are both arts requiring science―but they are aimed at different purposes. Art is difficult to define but is an ability to make something of more than ordinary significance. Science is a branch of knowledge which is systematic, testable, and objective― science is what we know. When architecture and engineering get artificially separated, the outcomes may not be as they should be. For example, a developer investing in a new building might appoint an architect to develop a scheme proposal to meet the needs of the client. If that is done without the involvement of properly qualified engineers then, later, when the project gets underway, there will inevitably be practical problems. In the worst building projects architects specify structural forms that may simply be unbuildable or unnecessarily expensive to build. It follows that in the best building projects architects and engineers work together right from the start. Good structural design can provide a huge amount of savings in the cost of construction.",
		"In the twelfth to thirteenth centuries there appeared the first manuals teaching “table manners” to the offspring of aristocrats. It was a genre that subsequently had a great success in the early modern period with The Courtier by Baldassare Castiglione, The Galateo by Monsignor Della Casa, and many others produced in different European countries. In a variety of ways and meanings, these are all instruments intended to define or distinguish who is in from who is out, separating the participants from the ostracized. It is for this reason that manuals of “good manners” addressed to the aristocracy always have a negative reference to the peasant who behaves badly, who “doesn’t know” what the rules are, and for this reason is excluded from the lordly table. Food etiquette had become a sign of social barriers and of the impossibility of breaking them down.",
		"An object at rest tends to stay at rest. To change is to learn something new, to think differently, to act differently, and to move in a new direction. Great ideas, great people, and great projects have fallen victim to resistance to change. Resistance to change means people are working hard to protect the status quo. When people who resist are ignored or pushed aside, they become formidable opposition. In order to succeed at change, resistance and the people who resist should be viewed differently. Here’s why: Resistance is a natural part of the change process and exists in many forms. People resist for different reasons and in different ways. To master change, you must first understand the personal, structural, and physiological reasons people resist. When you understand resistance, you can learn to expect it and even use it to your advantage. Understanding and managing resistance is critical when you are promoting change.",
		"Libraries are becoming increasingly interested in the services they are providing for their users. This is an important focus―especially as more and more information becomes available electronically. However, the traditional strengths of libraries have always been their collections. This is true still today―especially in research libraries. Also, collection makeup is the hardest thing to change quickly. For example, if a library has a long tradition of heavily collecting materials published in Mexico, then even if that library stops purchasing all Mexican imprints, its Mexican collection will still be large and impressive for several years to come unless they start withdrawing books. Likewise, if a library has not collected much in a subject, and then decides to start collecting heavily in that area it will take several years for the collection to be large enough and rich enough to be considered an important research tool.",
		"Sometimes social learning is direct. I want to know how to solve a problem with my computer, and the help­desk adviser tells me where to find the crucial command in the menu; I want to know how to operate my wireless speaker set, and my daughter shows me the right command. Most of the recent, expanding experimental literature focuses on such cases of pure instruction, or pure demonstration, for example, in testing the reliability of transmission chains under various conditions. Many studies of social learning in children focus on the fidelity with which information flows from one child to another in diffusion chains. But the most consequential cases of social learning in humans have not depended on pure demonstration or instruction. Rather, most social learning is hybrid learning: agents acquire skills through socially guided trial and error and socially guided practice. Children do get advice, instruction, and other informational head starts from others, but they get this support while engaged in exploratory learning in their environment.",
		"Inspiration is a funny thing. It’s powerful enough to move mountains. When it strikes, it carries an author forward like the rushing torrents of a flooded river. And yet, if you wait for it, nothing happens. The irony is that so much is actually created―mountains moved, sagas written, grand murals painted―by those who might not even describe themselves as particularly inspired. Instead, they show up every day and put their hands on the keyboard, their pen to paper, and they move their stories forward, bit by bit, word by word, perhaps not even recognizing that inspiration is striking in hundreds of tiny, microscopic ways as they push through another sentence, another page, another chapter. “I write when the spirit moves me, and the spirit moves me every day,” said William Faulkner. This is the principle way writers finish 50,000 words of a novel each year during National Novel Writing Month―by showing up―and it applies to being creative the rest of the year as well.",
		"Problem framing amounts to defining what problem you are proposing to solve. This is a critical activity because the frame you choose strongly influences your understanding of the problem, thereby conditioning your approach to solving it. For an illustration, consider Thibodeau and Broditsky’s series of experiments in which they asked people for ways to reduce crime in a community. They found that the respondents’ suggestions changed significantly depending on whether the metaphor used to describe crime was as a virus or as a beast. People presented with a metaphor comparing crime to a virus invading their city emphasized prevention and addressing the root causes of the problem, such as eliminating poverty and improving education. On the other hand, people presented with the beast metaphor focused on remediations: increasing the size of the police force and prisons.",
		"Pet owners sometimes tire of their animals or become overwhelmed by caring for a large number of pets or a difficult pet. Rather than face the stress of turning the pet in to a shelter, owners drive pets far from their home range and abandon them. Some people believe the animal has a better chance to survive roaming free than at a shelter, a false belief formed to salve the pet abandoner’s conscience. Releasing your pet, whether a cat, rabbit, or bearded dragon, is not the answer. Typically, people report roaming dogs for pickup by animal control authorities, who take the dog to the local shelter. Cats and exotic or unusual animals, unless confined to a small area, are not usually discovered or reported. Released pets not captured and sheltered suffer from weather, wild predators, and a lack of adequate food. Some pets die a difficult death. Other released pets survive and breed successfully. In these cases, the survivor pets become an invasive species and the environment suffers.",
		"Conventional wisdom in the West, influenced by philosophers from Plato to Descartes, credits individuals and especially geniuses with creativity and originality. Social and cultural influences and causes are minimized, ignored, or eliminated from consideration at all. Thoughts, original and conventional, are identified with individuals, and the special things that individuals are and do are traced to their genes and their brains. The “trick” here is to recognize that individual humans are social constructions themselves, embodying and reflecting the variety of social and cultural influences they have been exposed to during their lives. Our individuality is not denied, but it is viewed as a product of specific social and cultural experiences. The brain itself is a social thing, influenced structurally and at the level of its connectivities by social environments. The “individual” is a legal, religious, and political fiction just as the “I” is a grammatical illusion.",
		"The principle of humane treatment exerts an important constraint on the administration of criminal justice, a state­run process which has the potential to do very great harm to anybody who becomes caught up in its snares. Suspects and the accused are the ones most obviously in jeopardy. Procedural rules contribute to suspects’ humane treatment by providing them with legal advice and assistance to prepare and present their cases in court. Rules of evidence perform a similar function by affording accused persons fair opportunity to answer the charges against them, whilst at the same time respecting their right to remain silent if they choose to keep their counsel and put the prosecution to proof. These and other rules of criminal evidence and procedure treat the accused as thinking, feeling, human subjects of official concern and respect, who are entitled to be given the opportunity to play an active part in procedures with a direct and possibly catastrophic impact on their welfare.",
		"Despite excellent training, actors inevitably experience the visceral life of their characters, even if it is for brief moments during a performance. Self­perceptions are altered during the course of a performance, and even more so during long performance seasons. For many actors, they experience greater empathy and social cognition for their character, which may intensify identity boundary blurring. As well, actors tend to employ more dissociative processes, which increase potential character boundary blurring. Actors also experience more unresolved mourning for past trauma and loss experiences because they continually draw from these experiences when portraying characters. Adding to this tendency to merge with the creative work, audience members also confuse the character’s personality with the actor’s personality. Audience attribution errors may increase distress in the actor, including fearing that their personality identity is not stable.",
		"Early astronomers saw and learned more from eclipses and other forms of shadow than from direct observation. In Galileo’s time, the empiricist’s insistence on direct observation as the only legitimate way of knowing limited what could be learned about the cosmos, and the medievalist allowance for extraperceptual insights had nothing to contribute to what we would consider scientific inquiry. Galileo’s breakthroughs came in part from his understanding of how to use shadows to extend his powers of observation. At the time he trained his telescope on Venus, it was believed the planet shone with its own light and moved in an orbit independent of the sun. Galileo saw that the planet was in partial shadow as it went through its phases, and thus had to be a dark body. He also realized from the logic of the shadow that Venus orbited the sun, since all phases from new to full could be observed from earth. The end of the Ptolemaic system came quickly thereafter, a shadow thus shedding light on the ordering of the cosmos.",
		"Children can move effortlessly between play and absorption in a story, as if both are forms of the same activity. The taking of roles in a narratively structured game of pirates is not very different than the taking of roles in identifying with characters as one watches a movie. It might be thought that, as they grow towards adolescence, people give up childhood play, but this is not so. Instead, the bases and interests of this activity change and develop to playing and watching sports, to the fiction of plays, novels, and movies, and nowadays to video games. In fiction, one can enter possible worlds. When we experience emotions in such worlds, this is not a sign that we are being incoherent or regressed. It derives from trying out metaphorical transformations of our selves in new ways, in new worlds, in ways that can be moving and important to us.",
		"More recently there have been attempts to argue that unpaid work is work because ‘it is an activity that combines labour with raw materials to produce goods and services with enhanced economic value’. Economists such as Duncan Ironmonger have attempted to impute a dollar value on volunteering to enable its ‘economic’ value to be counted. Yet despite this, unpaid work and volunteering still remain outside the defined economic framework of our capitalist system because capitalism has competition and financial reward as its cornerstones and volunteering does not. Having said that, it has been estimated that volunteering contributes about $42 billion a year to the Australian economy. Although attempts to quantify and qualify the financial importance of volunteering in supporting our economic structures and enhancing our social capital continue to be made, it is slow going. And while volunteering remains outside the GDP, its true value and importance is neglected. Governments continue to pay lip service to the importance of volunteering but ultimately deny it official recognition.",
		"In Kant’s view, geometrical shapes are too perfect to induce an aesthetic experience. Insofar as they agree with the underlying concept or idea―thus possessing the precision that the ancient Greeks sought and celebrated―geometrical shapes can be grasped, but they do not give rise to emotion, and, most importantly, they do not move the imagination to free and new (mental) lengths. Forms or phenomena, on the contrary, that possess a degree of immeasurability, or that do not appear constrained, stimulate the human imagination― hence their ability to induce a sublime aesthetic experience. The pleasure associated with experiencing immeasurable objects―indefinable or formless objects―can be defined as enjoying one’s own emotional and mental activity. Namely, the pleasure consists of being challenged and struggling to understand and decode the phenomenon present to view. Furthermore, part of the pleasure comes from having one’s comfort zone (momentarily) violated.",
		"The most enduring lessons have to be learnt from the seismic response of ground and the built environment in the largest natural laboratory, i.e., the earth, from damage observations in all earthquakes, whether inter­ or intra­plate. Complete protection of all life and the entire built environment in all earthquakes is still a distant dream. However, efforts are on to have a built environment in which loss of life is minimized, and lifelines and infrastructure continue to function during and after an earthquake disaster. Construction activities in seismically prone and hazardous areas that are vulnerable to different damaging effects of earthquakes are best avoided. Most of the time such situations are unavoidable; in that case appropriate strengthening measures are required. Structures should be preferably made on firm ground. For construction in soft soil, the ground should be strengthened, and the foundations should be sufficiently deep, wide, and strong. Subsequently, application of appropriate interventions regarding earthquake­resistant design of structures goes a long way in saving human lives.",
		"Skills‑based approaches to teaching critical thinking now have a long history and literature, but what has become clear through more than 25 years of work on critical thinking theory and pedagogy is that teaching students a set of thinking skills does not seem to be enough. Students may learn to write an adequate article critique in one class, but fail to use those skills in another. They may learn how to evaluate research methodology in other students’ research designs, but completely miss the flaws in their own. They may learn to recognize thinking biases in the classroom, but still use badly flawed reasoning in their own decision making. Too often students think our courses are either about memorizing a great deal of material, or about learning the rules for and playing one more idiosyncratic academic game. Students regularly fail to understand what we are trying to teach them or they fail to transfer and generalize thinking skills across contexts and classes.",
		"By the start of the 16th century, the Renaissance movement had given birth to the Protestant Reformation and an era of profound religious change. The art of this period reflected the disruption caused by this shift. Appropriately named the Baroque, meaning irregular or distorted, European painting in the 16th century largely focused on capturing motion, drama, action, and powerful emotion. Painters employed the strong visual tools of dramatic composition, intense contrast of light and dark, and emotionally provocative subject matter to stir up feelings of disruption. Religious subjects were often portrayed in this era through new dramatic visual language, a contrast to the reverential portrayal of religious figures in earlier traditions. In order to capture the social disruption surrounding Christianity and the Roman Catholic Church, many artists abandoned old standards of visual perfection from the Classical and Renaissance periods in their portrayal of religious figures.",
		"Considerable work by cultural psychologists and anthropologists has shown that there are indeed large and sometimes surprising differences in the words and concepts that different cultures have for describing emotions, as well as in the social circumstances that draw out the expression of particular emotions. However, those data do not actually show that different cultures have different emotions, if we think of emotions as central, neurally implemented states. As for, say, color vision, they just say that, despite the same internal processing architecture, how we interpret, categorize, and name emotions varies according to culture and that we learn in a particular culture the social context in which it is appropriate to express emotions. However, the emotional states themselves are likely to be quite invariant across cultures. In a sense, we can think of a basic, culturally universal emotion set that is shaped by evolution and implemented in the brain, but the links between such emotional states and stimuli, behavior, and other cognitive states are plastic and can be modified by learning in a specific cultural context.",
		"Environmental learning occurs when farmers base decisions on observations of “payoff” information. They may observe their own or neighbors’ farms, but it is the empirical results they are using as a guide, not the neighbors themselves. They are looking at farming activities as experiments and assessing such factors as relative advantage, compatibility with existing resources, difficulty of use, and “trialability”―how well can it be experimented with. But that criterion of “trialability” turns out to be a real problem; it’s true that farmers are always experimenting, but working farms are very flawed laboratories. Farmers cannot set up the controlled conditions of professional test plots in research facilities. Farmers also often confront complex and difficult-to-observe phenomena that would be hard to manage even if they could run controlled experiments. Moreover farmers can rarely acquire payoff information on more than a few of the production methods they might use, which makes the criterion of “relative advantage” hard to measure.",
		"Most of us make our career choices when we are about eighteen. At eighteen, you have limited experience, very limited skills and most of what you know comes from your parents, your environment and the structured school system you have gone through. You are usually slightly better at some skills because you have spent a bit more time on them. Maybe someone in your environment was good at something and passionate enough to get you interested in spending more time in that area. It is also possible that you might have a specific physical feature—such as being tall— that might make you better at certain activities, such as playing basketball. In any case, most people make a decision regarding their career and direction in life based on their limited experiences and biases in their childhood and teenage years. This decision will come to dominate their life for many years to come. No wonder so many get it wrong! It is easier to get it wrong than to get it right, because statistically, there are more wrong ways than right ways.",
		"Whenever possible, we should take measures to re­socialize the information we think about. The continual patter we carry on in our heads is in fact a kind of internalized conversation. Likewise, many of the written forms we encounter at school and at work—from exams and evaluations, to profiles and case studies, to essays and proposals—are really social exchanges (questions, stories, arguments) put on paper and addressed to some imagined listener or interlocutor. There are significant advantages to turning such interactions at a remove back into actual social encounters. Research demonstrates that the brain processes the “same” information differently, and often more effectively, when other human beings are involved—whether we’re imitating them, debating them, exchanging stories with them, synchronizing and cooperating with them, teaching or being taught by them. We are inherently social creatures, and our thinking benefits from bringing other people into our train of thought.",
		"Facing large-scale, long-term change can seem overwhelming. Problems like global contagion or economic inequality are so complex that it can be hard to believe any intervention might make a difference. Working through fears of what could be depends on connecting with the abstract. Linking issues like climate change, for example, with the realities of our own neighborhoods, jobs, and relationships, translates conceptual ideas into concrete emotions. Thinking of how the beaches we love might disappear, how more frequent floods might destroy our homes, or how we might have to move to flee mounting wildfire risk, evokes feelings like anger, sadness, or guilt― feelings that inspire us to act. A recent study found that when people feel personally affected by potential climatic change, they are more likely to support carbon reduction efforts and push for proactive policies. Forming emotional connections to potential futures helps us move from denial and despair to action.",
		"There are pressures within the museum that cause it to emphasise what happens in the galleries over the activities that take place in its unseen zones. In an era when museums are forced to increase their earnings, they often focus their energies on modernising their galleries or mounting temporary exhibitions to bring more and more audiences through the door. In other words, as museums struggle to survive in a competitive economy, their budgets often prioritise those parts of themselves that are consumable: infotainment in the galleries, goods and services in the cafes and the shops. The unlit, unglamorous storerooms, if they are ever discussed, are at best presented as service areas that process objects for the exhibition halls. And at worst, as museums pour more and more resources into their publicly visible faces, the spaces of storage may even suffer, their modernisation being kept on hold or being given less and less space to house the expanding collections and serve their complex conservation needs.",
		"For those of any age with an existing network of friendships built up in the three­dimensional world, social networking sites can be a happy extension of communication, along with email, video calls, or phone calls, when face­to­face time together just isn’t possible. The danger comes when a fake identity is both tempting and possible through relationships that are not based on real, three­dimensional interaction, and/or when the most important things in your life are the secondhand lives of others rather than personal experiences. Living in the context of the screen might suggest false norms of desirable lifestyles full of friends and parties. As ordinary human beings follow the activities of these golden individuals, self­esteem will inevitably drop; yet the constant narcissistic obsession with the self and its inadequacies will dominate. We can imagine a vicious circle where the more your identity is harmed as a result of social networking and the more inadequate you feel, the greater the appeal of a medium where you don’t need to communicate with people face­to­face.",
		"The primary purpose of commercial music radio broadcasting is to deliver an audience to a group of advertisers and sponsors. To achieve commercial success, that audience must be as large as possible. More than any other characteristics (such as demographic or psychographic profile, purchasing power, level of interest, degree of satisfaction, quality of attention or emotional state), the quantity of an audience aggregated as a mass is the most significant metric for broadcasters seeking to make music radio for profitable ends. As a result, broadcasters attempt to maximise their audience size by playing music that is popular, or―at the very least―music that can be relied upon not to cause audiences to switch off their radio or change the station. Audience retention is a key value (if not the key value) for many music programmers and for radio station management. In consequence, a high degree of risk aversion frequently marks out the ‘successful’ radio music programmer. Playlists are restricted, and often very small.",
		"Just as today some jobs are better than others, so would they have been in early societies with their blossoming towns and eventually cities, with some roles more dangerous and some having more plentiful access to food or other resources. The archeological record shows that soon after the appearance of towns, agriculture, and surpluses, some burials start to look different from others. Some individuals are buried with more precious goods (metals, weapons, and maybe even art), some are in group graves and some by themselves, and still others don’t even seem to be buried at all. The bones from the burials start to show us differences as well—chemical and isotope analyses of teeth and long bones reveal that some members of groups were getting more protein or minerals than others; some have more evidence of diseases and greater physical injuries from their labors. Early on these differences are small, but by 5,000 to 7,000 years ago they are becoming quite pronounced.",
		"Sociologist Brooke Harrington said if there was an E=mc^2 of social science, it would be SD>PD, “social death is more frightening than physical death.” This is why we feel deeply threatened when a new idea challenges the ones that have become part of our identity. For some ideas, the ones that identify us as members of a group, we don’t reason as individuals; we reason as a member of a tribe. We want to seem trustworthy, and reputation management as a trustworthy individual often overrides most other concerns, even our own mortality. This is not entirely irrational. A human alone in this world faces a lot of difficulty, but being alone in the world before modern times was almost certainly a death sentence. So we carry with us an innate drive to form groups, join groups, remain in those groups, and oppose other groups. But once you can identify them, you start favoring us; so much so that given a choice between an outcome that favors both groups a lot or one that favors both much less but still favors yours more than theirs, that’s the one you will pick.",
		"Many disciplines are better learned by entering into the doing than by mere abstract study. This is often the case with the most abstract as well as the seemingly more practical disciplines. For example, within the philosophical disciplines, logic must be learned through the use of examples and actual problem solving. Only after some time and struggle does the student begin to develop the insights and intuitions that enable him to see the centrality and relevance of this mode of thinking. This learning by doing is essential in many of the sciences. For instance, only after a good deal of observation do the sparks in the bubble chamber become recognizable as the specific movements of identifiable particles.",
		"The most normal and competent child encounters what seem like insurmountable problems in living. But by playing them out, he may become able to cope with them in a step-by-step process. He often does so in symbolic ways that are hard for even him to understand, as he is reacting to inner processes whose origin may be buried deep in his unconscious. This may result in play that makes little sense to us at the moment, since we do not know the purposes it serves. When there is no immediate danger, it is usually best to approve of the child’s play without interfering. Efforts to assist him in his struggles, while well intentioned, may divert him from seeking and eventually finding the solution that will serve him best.",
		"Twin sirens hide in the sea of history, tempting those seeking to understand and appreciate the past onto the reefs of misunderstanding and misinterpretation. These twin dangers are temporocentrism and ethnocentrism. Temporocentrism is the belief that your times are the best of all possible times. All other times are thus inferior. Ethnocentrism is the belief that your culture is the best of all possible cultures. All other cultures are thus inferior. Temporocentrism and ethnocentrism unite to cause individuals and cultures to judge all other individuals and cultures by the “superior” standards of their current culture. This leads to a total lack of perspective when dealing with past and/or foreign cultures and a resultant misunderstanding and misappreciation of them. Temporocentrism and ethnocentrism tempt moderns into unjustified criticisms of the peoples of the past.",
		"The precision of the lines on the map, the consistency with which symbols are used, the grid and/or projection system, the apparent certainty with which place names are written and placed, and the legend and scale information all give the map an aura of scientific accuracy and objectivity. Although subjective interpretation goes into the construction of these cartographic elements, the finished map appears to express an authoritative truth about the world, separate from any interests and influences. The very trust that this apparent objectivity inspires is what makes maps such powerful carriers of ideology. However unnoticeably, maps do indeed reflect the world views of either their makers or, more probably, the supporters of their makers, in addition to the political and social conditions under which they were made. Some of the simple ideological messages that maps can convey include: This land is and has long been ours; here is the center of the universe; if we do not claim this land, the enemies you most fear will.",
		"Sensory-specific satiety is defined as a decrease in appetite, or the subjective liking for the food that is consumed, with little change in the hedonics of uneaten food. As a result of sensory-specific satiety, when people consume a variety of foods, they tend to overeat. A greater variety of food leads people to eat more than they would otherwise. So, being full and feeling sated are separate matters. The recovery of appetite or the motivation to eat is apparent to anyone who has consumed a large meal and is quite full, and does not require additional energy or nutrients to meet their daily needs, but decides to consume additional calories after seeing the dessert cart. Small changes in the sensory properties of foods are sufficient to increase food intake. For example, subjects who were presented with different shapes of pasta showed increased hedonic ratings and increased energy consumption relative to subjects eating only a single shape of pasta.",
		"We argue that the ethical principles of justice provide an essential foundation for policies to protect unborn generations and the poorest countries from climate change. Related issues arise in connection with current and persistently inadequate aid for these nations, in the face of growing threats to agriculture and water supply, and the rules of international trade that mainly benefit rich countries. Increasing aid for the world’s poorest peoples can be an essential part of effective mitigation. With 20 percent of carbon emissions from (mostly tropical) deforestation, carbon credits for forest preservation would combine aid to poorer countries with one of the most cost-effective forms of abatement. Perhaps the most cost-effective but politically complicated policy reform would be the removal of several hundred billions of dollars of direct annual subsidies from the two biggest recipients in the OECD―destructive industrial agriculture and fossil fuels. Even a small amount of this money would accelerate the already rapid rate of technical progress and investment in renewable energy in many areas, as well as encourage the essential switch to conservation agriculture.",
		"Human beings do not enter the world as competent moral agents. Nor does everyone leave the world in that state. But somewhere in between, most people acquire a bit of decency that qualifies them for membership in the community of moral agents. Genes, development, and learning all contribute to the process of becoming a decent human being. The interaction between nature and nurture is, however, highly complex, and developmental biologists are only just beginning to grasp just how complex it is. Without the context provided by cells, organisms, social groups, and culture, DNA is inert. Anyone who says that people are “genetically programmed” to be moral has an oversimplified view of how genes work. Genes and environment interact in ways that make it nonsensical to think that the process of moral development in children, or any other developmental process, can be discussed in terms of nature versus nurture. Developmental biologists now know that it is really both, or nature through nurture. A complete scientific explanation of moral evolution and development in the human species is a very long way off.",
		"Difficulties arise when we do not think of people and machines as collaborative systems, but assign whatever tasks can be automated to the machines and leave the rest to people. This ends up requiring people to behave in machine-like fashion, in ways that differ from human capabilities. We expect people to monitor machines, which means keeping alert for long periods, something we are bad at. We require people to do repeated operations with the extreme precision and accuracy required by machines, again something we are not good at. When we divide up the machine and human components of a task in this way, we fail to take advantage of human strengths and capabilities but instead rely upon areas where we are genetically, biologically unsuited. Yet, when people fail, they are blamed.",
		"Scientists use paradigms rather than believing them. The use of a paradigm in research typically addresses related problems by employing shared concepts, symbolic expressions, experimental and mathematical tools and procedures, and even some of the same theoretical statements. Scientists need only understand how to use these various elements in ways that others would accept. These elements of shared practice thus need not presuppose any comparable unity in scientists’ beliefs about what they are doing when they use them. Indeed, one role of a paradigm is to enable scientists to work successfully without having to provide a detailed account of what they are doing or what they believe about it. Thomas Kuhn noted that scientists “can agree in their identification of a paradigm without agreeing on, or even attempting to produce, a full interpretation or rationalization of it. Lack of a standard interpretation or of an agreed reduction to rules will not prevent a paradigm from guiding research.”",
		"An important advantage of disclosure, as opposed to more aggressive forms of regulation, is its flexibility and respect for the operation of free markets. Regulatory mandates are blunt swords; they tend to neglect diversity and may have serious unintended adverse effects. For example, energy efficiency requirements for appliances may produce goods that work less well or that have characteristics that consumers do not want. Information provision, by contrast, respects freedom of choice. If automobile manufacturers are required to measure and publicize the safety characteristics of cars, potential car purchasers can trade safety concerns against other attributes, such as price and styling. If restaurant customers are informed of the calories in their meals, those who want to lose weight can make use of the information, leaving those who are unconcerned about calories unaffected. Disclosure does not interfere with, and should even promote, the autonomy (and quality) of individual decision-making.",
		"Managers of natural resources typically face market incentives that provide financial rewards for exploitation. For example, owners of forest lands have a market incentive to cut down trees rather than manage the forest for carbon capture, wildlife habitat, flood protection, and other ecosystem services. These services provide the owner with no financial benefits, and thus are unlikely to influence management decisions. But the economic benefits provided by these services, based on their non-market values, may exceed the economic value of the timber. For example, a United Nations initiative has estimated that the economic benefits of ecosystem services provided by tropical forests, including climate regulation, water purification, and erosion prevention, are over three times greater per hectare than the market benefits. Thus cutting down the trees is economically inefficient, and markets are not sending the correct “signal” to favor ecosystem services over extractive uses.",
		"If you start collecting and analyzing data without first clarifying the question you are trying to answer, you’re probably doing yourself more harm than good. You’ll end up drowning in a flood of information and realize only later that most of that research was a waste of time. To avoid this problem, you should develop a problem­-solving design plan before you start collecting information. In the design plan, you clarify the issues you are trying to solve, state your hypotheses, and list what is required to prove those hypotheses. Developing this plan before you start researching will greatly increase your problem­-solving productivity. In addition, putting your plan down on paper will not only clarify your thoughts. If you’re working in a group, this plan will also help your team focus on what to do and provide the starting point for your group brainstorming.",
		"The size of a species is not accidental. It’s a fine-tuned interaction between a species and the world it inhabits. Over large periods of time, size fluctuations have often signalled significant changes in the environment. Generally speaking, over the last five hundred million years, the trend has been towards animals getting larger. It’s particularly notable in marine animals, whose average body size has increased 150-fold in this time. But we are beginning to see changes in this trend. Scientists have discovered that many animals are shrinking. Around the world, species in every category have been found to be getting smaller, and one major cause appears to be the heat.  Animals living in the Italian Alps, for example, have seen temperatures rise by three to four degrees Celsius since the 1980s. To avoid overheating, chamois goats now spend more of their days resting rather than searching for food, and as a result, in just a few decades, the new generations of chamois are 25 percent smaller.",
		"Suppose you come home from school to find a cushion torn apart on the living room floor. The stuffing has been pulled out, and small pieces of it are everywhere. As you set down your backpack, your dog runs toward you. As she jumps into your arms, you find that she is covered with pieces of the cushion’s stuffing. You know that you were the last person to leave that morning. You think about this information and come up with a possible explanation, based on the facts, that she tore apart the cushion. This process is called drawing a conclusion.",
		"When I was eight years old and was spending a weekend at my aunt’s, a middle­-aged man visited one evening. After a polite argument with my aunt, he devoted his attention to me. At that time, I was excited about boats, and the visitor discussed the subject with me in a way that seemed to me particularly interesting. After he left, I spoke of him with enthusiasm. What a man! To reduce my excitement, my aunt informed me that he, a New York lawyer, cared nothing about them. I asked for the reason he still talked all the time about boats. My aunt answered, “Because he is a gentleman. He saw you were interested in boats, and he talked about the things he knew would interest and please you.”",
		"Many authors feel that scientific papers must use complex language to sound more scientific. They think so because they forget that they are writing for a wide audience, and that they should be using concise language. Don’t use too many words when a few will do, and don’t use an overly complicated word when a simple word will do. Besides these issues of writing style, there are other barriers to clear communication that negatively affect your paper’s chance of publication in a top journal. Most journals ask that you keep the use of non­standard abbreviations to an absolute minimum. But many authors ignore this request without realizing that excessive use of abbreviations makes reading difficult. There is nothing wrong with spelling out words completely.",
		"You’ll see a good example of science in action every time a police car with its siren blaring passes you in the street. Everyone knows that the sound changes as it passes you. It’s not that the siren changes its tune but it is because of something known as the Doppler Effect. This is where the sound waves coming from moving objects get squashed or stretched depending on whether something is moving toward or away from you. Something similar happens with light waves as well as other electromagnetic radiation such as X­-rays and microwaves. Things moving away from you get redder while things moving toward you get bluer. As a result, this effect is known as red or blue shift. You can’t normally notice this effect with light because the object has to be moving at huge speeds but you can with distant galaxies.",
		"Imagine that a study on the effects of drinking coffee comes out in the news. The study suggests that drinking at least three cups a day significantly improves attention and memory. A woman reads this study and immediately increases her morning coffee ritual to three cups. For the next month she thinks she is more attentive and remembering things better because she’s drinking more coffee. Then she reads a newer study that says drinking more than two cups of coffee a day is linked to significantly decreased attention and heightened anxiety. The second study has been promoted as actively as the first, and is equally convincing. She thinks, “I have been feeling more anxious lately, and maybe I’m not as focused as I thought,” and she decreases her coffee intake down to two cups.",
		"We frequently overestimate agreement with others, believing that everyone else thinks and feels exactly like we do. This misconception is called the false-consensus effect. Psychologist Lee Ross began studying this in 1977. He made a sandwich board with the slogan ‘Eat at Joe’s’ and asked randomly selected students to wear it around campus for thirty minutes. They also had to estimate how many other students would do the task. Those who were willing to wear the sign assumed that the majority would also agree to it. On the other hand, those who refused believed that most people would find it too stupid to do. In both cases, the students imagined themselves to be in the majority.",
		"I took a job on the night shift because the money was much better. Unfortunately, working at night meant I could no longer have dinner with my wife and kids. A sandwich in the cafeteria isn’t exactly the same thing as a hot meal at home. One night, my wife surprised me by packing up the kids a n d dinner and coming to see me at work. The five of us sat around the cafeteria table and it was the best meal I’d had in a long time. I took a slightly longer break than usual and my boss wasn’t too happy about that. So, we couldn’t do it very often, but I loved it when they came.",
		"Detective work is a two­-part process. First, a detective must find the clues. But the clues alone don’t solve the case. The detective must also draw conclusions based on those clues. These conclusions are also called inferences. Inferences are conclusions based on reasons, facts, or evidence. The same sort of process takes place in reading. You need to look for clues and then draw conclusions based on those clues. What is the writer trying to say? Good conclusions come from good observations. To be a better reader, be more like Sherlock Holmes: be more observant.",
		"There are many situations where other people try to influence our mood by changing the atmosphere of the environment; probably you have already done the same. For example, let us imagine that a man is in the unfortunate situation where he forgot his wedding anniversary. The man tries to rescue the situation by preparing a self-cooked, candlelit dinner for his wife with romantic background music. Whether or not he is aware of it, a candlelit dinner is a fantastic way to influence a person’s mood. When the man’s wife enters the room, she is surprised by the delicious aroma of the outstanding dinner he has prepared. The low-level light of the candle puts her in a relaxed spirit. And finally, romantic music does the rest to make the wife willing to accept the husband’s apology for the mistake.",
		"Athletes often report that when they are doing well in their sport the size of the target looks incredibly large. This is in contrast to the experience of the target looking incredibly small when the players are not doing well. To test this phenomenon, Jessica Witt and Dennis Proffitt recruited men and women softball players immediately after their games. They had the players look at a poster with a variety of circles on it and asked them to indicate the circle they felt best represented the size of a softball. They also collected from the players their “stats” from the game they had just completed so that the researchers could compute batting averages. They found those players who had better batting averages perceived the ball size as larger than those who had poorer ones.",
		"How can you tell the difference between a hard­boiled egg and a raw egg without breaking them? Spin both the eggs! You will find the hard­boiled egg spins so easily while the raw one doesn’t. Also, you will notice the raw egg will spin more slowly and it will shake! This is because the raw egg is fluid inside, whereas the hard­boiled egg is solid. When you spin the raw egg, the fluid inside moves around and causes the shaking. But the hard­boiled egg has no fluid like the raw egg, so it doesn’t shake. Put your finger briefly on the eggs to stop them spinning. When you take your finger away, the raw egg will continue to spin for a few more seconds, as the fluid inside is still moving. The hard­boiled egg will stop instantly.",
		"It is said that in ancient Athens the followers of Plato gathered one day to ask themselves the following question: “What is a human being?” After a great deal of thought, they came up with the following answer: “a human being is a featherless biped.” Everybody seemed content with this definition until a philosopher burst into the lecture hall with a live featherless chicken. Holding it in his hand, he shouted “Look! I present you with a human being.” After the stir had died down, the philosophers gathered again and improved their definition. A human being, they said, is featherless biped with broad nails. This curious story from the history of early philosophy shows the kinds of difficulties philosophers have sometimes been faced with when attempting to give abstract, general definitions of what it is to be human.",
		"In prehistoric times, humans faced challenges different from those they face today. For example, a common challenge for prehistoric man may have been to walk outside his cave in the morning and find himself face-to-face with a huge, hungry lion. When confronted with such a threat, the brain would send the signal, “Threat!” and the body would respond by shooting hormones, such as adrenaline, into the bloodstream at lightning speed. That made the body immediately stronger and faster so the human could either wrestle the lion or run away very fast. When humans either fought or ran away, the physical activity would use up the hormones, and the body chemistry would quickly return to normal.",
		"Maybe you have watched the sun as it was setting in the sky. Sometimes it looks as though it is on fire, especially when it is shining through the clouds. The reason it looks that way is that the sun is on fire. Can you guess how hot the fire at the center of the sun is? It is more than 25 million degrees on the Fahrenheit scale! That’s 250,000 times hotter than the hottest summer day at your favorite amusement park. But what may surprise you even more is there are many stars in the universe that are thousands of times hotter than the sun.",
		"I did a television show once with Louis Armstrong. All of a sudden, as Louis was playing, a fly landed on his nose. So he blew it off. He kept singing, and the fly landed back on his nose. So he blew it off again. It was being taped, and everyone in the audience tried not to show they were laughing. They didn’t want to let their laughter out and ruin his performance. When Louis finished, everybody burst into laughter. And then the director came out and said: “Let’s do one more take without the fly.” But that was the take he should have put on TV.",
		"The habit of reading books multiple times encourages people to engage with them emotionally. If they only read a book once, they tend to only focus on the events and stories in it. But with a second read­through, the repeated experience brings back the initial emotions caused by the book, and allows people to appreciate those emotions at their leisure. By enjoying the emotional effects of the book more deeply, people become more in touch with their own feelings. Despite their familarity with the stories, re­reading brings renewed understanding of both the book and themselves. The same effect can be seen with familiar holiday destinations. Re­visiting a place can also help people better understand both the place and themselves. Considering the immense benefits, don’t hesitate to give re­consuming a try.",
		"To rise, a fish must reduce its overall density, and most fish do this with a swim bladder.  A fish fills its bladder with oxygen collected from the surrounding water. As it is filled, the bladder expands. Then, the fish has a greater volume, but its weight is not greatly increased. This means that its density has been decreasing, so the fish experiences a greater rising force. Finally, when the bladder is fully expanded, the fish is at its maximum volume and is pushed to the surface. Most fish rise using this method, but not all do. Some species don’t need a swim bladder because they spend all their lives moving along the ocean floor. Other fish float and sink by propelling themselves forward.",
		"Frank Barrett, an organizational behavior expert, explains that disrupting routines and looking at a situation from another’s perspective can lead to new solutions. In a lecture, Barrett shares the story of an airline that was dealing with many complaints about their customer service. The airline’s leaders held a workshop to focus on how to create a better experience for their customers. While everyone else was in meetings on the first day of the workshop, the airline’s vice president of marketing had the beds in each leader’s hotel room replaced with airline seats. After having spent that night in airline seats, the company’s leaders came up with some “radical innovations.” If he had not disrupted their sleeping routines and allowed them to experience their customers’ discomfort, the workshop may have ended without any noteworthy changes.",
		"As is true of some fish, fathead minnows that have been attacked release chemicals from specialized cells in the skin. Traditionally, these chemicals have been considered alarm signals designed to alert other members of the species to the presence of a predator. In some cases, fish exposed to these chemicals do indeed appear to hide. However, observations of this sort raise a question about this conventional view: How can an injured fish benefit from helping others of its species to escape from a predator? Perhaps injured fish do not release these special chemicals to benefit others, but rather to help themselves. They might be attracting additional predators that may interfere with the initial attacker, occasionally resulting in the release of the captured prey.",
		"When you look at a map, you may conclude―as commercial airline navigators once did―that the best way to get from Amsterdam to Tokyo is to head in an easterly direction along what is known as the Mediterranean route. But look at a globe instead of a map, and your perspective may change. Rather than heading east on the Mediterranean route, commercial planes going from Amsterdam to Tokyo now fly north! That’s right. They take what is known as the ‘polar route,’ flying over the North Pole to Alaska, and then west to Tokyo―for a savings of roughly 1,500 miles! What is the lesson here? After you’ve decided on a goal, work hard to accomplish it, but keep looking for ways of achieving the goal more efficiently, perhaps from a different angle. This approach is sometimes known as reframing.",
		"Why does garbage exist in the human system but not more broadly in nature? Nature is a beautiful harmony of systems whereby every system’s output is a useful input for other systems. An acorn that falls from a tree is an important input for a squirrel that eats it. The by-product of that delicious meal —the squirrel’s poop—is an important input for the microbes that consume it. The output of the microbes—rich humus and soil—is in turn the very material from which a new oak tree may grow. Even the carbon dioxide that the squirrel breathes out is what that tree may breathe in. This cycle is the fundamental reason why life has thrived on our planet for millions of years. It’s like the Ouroboros— the ancient symbol depicting a snake or dragon eating its own tail; in a way, nature truly is a constant cycle of consuming itself.",
		"In negotiation, there often will be issues that you do not care about—but that the other side cares about very much! It is important to identify these issues. For example, you may not care about whether you start your new job in June or July. But if your potential boss strongly prefers that you start as soon as possible, that’s a valuable piece of information. Now you are in a position to give her something that she values (at no cost to you) and get something of value in return. For example, you might start a month earlier and receive a larger bonus for doing so. Similarly, when purchasing my home, I discovered that the seller was very interested in closing the deal as soon as possible. So I agreed to close one month earlier than originally offered, and the seller agreed to a lower price.",
		"Andrew Carnegie, the great early­twentieth­century businessman, once heard his sister complain about her two sons. They were away at college and rarely responded to her letters. Carnegie told her that if he wrote them he would get an immediate response. He sent off two warm letters to the boys, and told them that he was happy to send each of them a check for a hundred dollars (a large sum in those days). Then he mailed the letters, but didn’t enclose the checks. Within days he received warm grateful letters from both boys, who noted at the letters’ end that he had unfortunately forgotten to include the check. If the check had been enclosed, would they have responded so quickly?",
		"In early 19th century London, a young man named Charles Dickens had a strong desire to be a writer. But everything seemed to be against him. He had never been able to attend school for more than four years. His father had been in jail because he couldn’t pay his debts, and this young man often knew the pain of hunger. Moreover, he had so little confidence in his ability to write that he mailed his writings secretly at night to editors so that nobody would laugh at him. Story after story was refused. But one day, one editor recognized and praised him. The praise that he received from getting one story in print changed his whole life. His works have been widely read and still enjoy great popularity. ",
		"One of the most essential decisions any of us can make is how we invest our time. Of course, how we invest time is not our decision alone to make. Many factors determine what we should do either because we are members of the human race, or because we belong to a certain culture and society. Nevertheless, there is room for personal choice, and control over time is to a certain extent in our hands. Even in the most oppressive decades of the Industrial Revolution, people didn’t give up their free will when it came to time. During this period, people worked for more than eighty hours a week in factories. But there were some who spent their few precious free hours reading books or getting involved in politics instead of following the majority into the pubs.  ",
		"Use a plastic pen and rub it on your hair about ten times and then hold the pen close to small pieces of tissue paper or chalk dust. You will find that the bits of paper or chalk dust cling to the pen. What you have done there is to create a form of electricity called static electricity. This kind of electricity is produced by friction, and the pen becomes electrically charged. Static electricity is also found in the atmosphere. During a thunderstorm, clouds may become charged as they rub against each other. The lightning that we often see during a storm is caused by a large flow of electrical charges between charged clouds and the earth. ",
		"From a correlational observation, we conclude that one variable is related to a second variable. But neither behavior could be directly causing the other even though there is a relationship. The following example will illustrate why it is difficult to make causal statements on the basis of correlational observation. The researchers at the U.S. Army conducted a study of motorcycle accidents, attempting to correlate the number of accidents with other variables such as socioeconomic level and age. They found the best predictor to be the number of tattoos the rider had. It would be a ridiculous error to conclude that tattoos cause motorcycle accidents or that motorcycle accidents cause tattoos. Obviously, a third variable is related to both—perhaps preference for risk. A person who is willing to take risks likes to be tattooed and also takes more chances on a motorcycle.",
		"Memory has two types―implicit and explicit memory. When you learn things without really thinking about it, it’s implicit memory or body memory. Knowing how to breathe when you were born is an implicit memory. No one taught this to you. Some of the things you’ve learned since childhood also become implicit memories. Implicit memories are imprinted in the brain’s autonomic portion; that is why even after years of not riding a bike you still know how to ride. Explicit memories, on the other hand, are the memories or the specific things that you consciously try to recall. You use explicit memory every day on a conscious level. Trying to find the keys, trying to remember when an event is supposed to take place, where it’s going to be held, and with whom you are going. Explicit memories are the tasks you have written down on your calendar or planner.",
		"For its time, ancient Greek civilization was remarkably advanced. The Greeks figured out mathematics, geometry, and calculus long before calculators were available. Centuries before telescopes were invented, they proposed that the earth might rotate on an axis or revolve around the sun. Along with these mathematical, scientific advances, the Greeks produced some of the early dramatic plays and poetry. In a world ruled by powerful kings and bloodthirsty warriors, the Greeks even developed the idea of democracy. But they were still a primitive people. There were many aspects of the world around them that they didn’t understand very well. They had big questions, like Why are we here? and Why is smoke coming out of that nearby volcano? Myths provided answers to those questions. They were educational tools, passing knowledge from one generation to the next. They also taught morality and conveyed truth about the complexity of life. In this way, the Greeks were able to understand right and wrong in their lives.",
		"Suppose that you are busy working on a project one day and you have no time to buy lunch. All of a sudden your best friend shows up with your favorite sandwich. He tells you that he knows you are busy and he wants to help you out by buying you the sandwich. In this case, you are very likely to appreciate your friend’s help. However, if a stranger shows up with the same sandwich and offers it to you, you won’t appreciate it. Instead, you would be confused. You would likely think “Who are you, and how do you know what kind of sandwich I like to eat?”  The key difference between these two cases is the level of trust. You trust your best friend so much that you won’t worry about him knowing you too well, but you certainly would not give the same level of trust to a stranger.",
		"Interpersonal messages combine content and relationship dimensions. That is, they refer to the real world, to something external to both speaker and listener; at the same time they also refer to the relationship between parties. For example, a supervisor may say to a trainee, “See me after the meeting.” This simple message has a content message that tells the trainee to see the supervisor after the meeting. It also contains a relationship message that says something about the connection between the supervisor and the trainee. Even the use of the simple command shows there is a status difference that allows the supervisor to command the trainee. You can appreciate this most clearly if you visualize the same command being made by the trainee to the supervisor. It appears awkward and out of place, because it violates the normal relationship between supervisor and trainee.",
		"The scientific study of the physical characteristics of colors can be traced back to Isaac Newton. One day, he spotted a set of prisms at a big county fair. He took them home and began to experiment with them. In a darkened room he allowed a thin ray of sunlight to fall on a triangular glass prism. As soon as the white ray hit the prism, it separated into the familiar colors of the rainbow. This finding was not new, as humans had observed the rainbow since the beginning of time. It was only when Newton placed a second prism in the path of the spectrum that he found something new. The composite colors produced a white beam. Thus he concluded that white light can be produced by combining the spectral colors.",
		"No one likes to think they’re average, least of all below average. When asked by psychologists, most people rate themselves above average on all manner of measures including intelligence, looks, health, and so on. Self­control is no different: people consistently overestimate their ability to control themselves. This over­confidence in self­control can lead people to assume they’ll be able to control themselves in situations in which, it turns out, they can’t. This is why trying to stop an unwanted habit can be an extremely frustrating task. Over the days and weeks from our resolution to change, we start to notice it popping up again and again. The old habit’s well­practiced performance is beating our conscious desire for change into submission.",
		"Trade will not occur unless both parties want what the other party has to offer. This is referred to as the double coincidence of wants. Suppose a farmer wants to trade eggs with a baker for a loaf of bread. If the baker has no need or desire for eggs, then the farmer is out of luck and does not get any bread. However, if the farmer is enterprising and utilizes his network of village friends, he might discover that the baker is in need of some new cast­iron trivets for cooling his bread, and it just so happens that the blacksmith needs a new lamb’s wool sweater. Upon further investigation, the farmer discovers that the weaver has been wanting an omelet for the past week. The farmer will then trade the eggs for the sweater, the sweater for the trivets, and the trivets for his fresh­baked loaf of bread.",
		"Color can impact how you perceive weight. Dark colors look heavy, and bright colors look less so. Interior designers often paint darker colors below brighter colors to put the viewer at ease. Product displays work the same way. Place bright-colored products higher and dark-colored products lower, given that they are of similar size. This will look more stable and allow customers to comfortably browse the products from top to bottom. In contrast, shelving dark-colored products on top can create the illusion that they might fall over, which can be a source of anxiety for some shoppers. Black and white, which have a brightness of 0% and 100%, respectively, show the most dramatic difference in perceived weight. In fact, black is perceived to be twice as heavy as white. Carrying the same product in a black shopping bag, versus a white one, feels heavier. So, small but expensive products like neckties and accessories are often sold in dark-colored shopping bags or cases.",
		"Ethical and moral systems are different for every culture. According to cultural relativism, all of these systems are equally valid, and no system is better than another. The basis of cultural relativism is the notion that no true standards of good and evil actually exist. Therefore, judging whether something is right or wrong is based on individual societies’ beliefs, and any moral or ethical opinions are affected by an individual’s cultural perspective. There exists an inherent logical inconsistency in cultural relativism, however. If one accepts the idea that there is no right or wrong, then there exists no way to make judgments in the first place. To deal with this inconsistency, cultural relativism creates “tolerance.” However, with tolerance comes intolerance, which means that tolerance must imply some sort of ultimate good. Thus, tolerance also goes against the very notion of cultural relativism, and the boundaries of logic make cultural relativism impossible.",
		"The basic difference between an AI robot and a normal robot is the ability of the robot and its software to make decisions, and learn and adapt to its environment based on data from its sensors. To be a bit more specific, the normal robot shows deterministic behaviors. That is, for a set of inputs, the robot will always produce the same output. For instance, if faced with the same situation, such as running into an obstacle, then the robot will always do the same thing, such as go around the obstacle to the left. An AI robot, however, can do two things the normal robot cannot: make decisions and learn from experience. It will adapt to circumstances, and may do something different each time a situation is faced. The AI robot may try to push the obstacle out of the way, or make up a new route, or change goals. ",
		"Collaboration is the basis for most of the foundational arts and sciences. It is often believed that Shakespeare, like most playwrights of his period, did not always write alone, and many of his plays are considered collaborative or were rewritten after their original composition. Leonardo Da Vinci made his sketches individually, but he collaborated with other people to add the finer details. For example, his sketches of human anatomy were a collaboration with Marcantonio della Torre, an anatomist from the University of Pavia. Their collaboration is important because it marries the artist with the scientist. Similarly, Marie Curie’s husband stopped his original research and joined Marie in hers. They went on to collaboratively discover radium, which overturned old ideas in physics and chemistry.",
		"In 1824, Peru won its freedom from Spain. Soon after, Simón Bolívar, the general who had led the liberating forces, called a meeting to write the first version of the constitution for the new country. After the meeting, the people wanted to do something special for Bolívar to show their appreciation for all he had done for them, so they offered him a gift of one million pesos, a very large amount of money in those days. Bolívar accepted the gift and then asked, “How many slaves are there in Peru?” He was told there were about three thousand. “And how much does a slave sell for?” he wanted to know. “About 350 pesos for a man,” was the answer. “Then,” said Bolívar, “I’ll add whatever is necessary to this million pesos you have given me and I will buy all the slaves in Peru and set them free. It makes no sense to free a nation, unless all its citizens enjoy freedom as well.”",
		"The next time you’re out under a clear, dark sky, look up. If you’ve picked a good spot for stargazing, you’ll see a sky full of stars, shining and twinkling like thousands of brilliant jewels. But this amazing sight of stars can also be confusing. Try and point out a single star to someone. Chances are, that person will have a hard time knowing exactly which star you’re looking at. It might be easier if you describe patterns of stars. You could say something like, “See that big triangle of bright stars there?” Or, “Do you see those five stars that look like a big letter W?”  When you do that, you’re doing exactly what we all do when we look at the stars. We look for patterns, not just so that we can point something out to someone else, but also because that’s what we humans have always done.",
		"We always have a lot of bacteria around us, as they live almost everywhere―in air, soil, in different parts of our bodies, and even in some of the foods we eat. But do not worry! Most bacteria are good for us. Some live in our digestive systems and help us digest our food, and some live in the environment and produce oxygen so that we can breathe and live on Earth. But unfortunately, a few of these wonderful creatures can sometimes make us sick. This is when we need to see a doctor, who may prescribe medicines to control the infection. But what exactly are these medicines and how do they fight with bacteria? These medicines are called “antibiotics,” which means “against the life of bacteria.” Antibiotics either kill bacteria or stop them from growing.",
		"To be successful, you need to understand the vital difference between believing you will succeed, and believing you will succeed easily. Put another way, it’s the difference between being a realistic optimist, and an unrealistic optimist. Realistic optimists believe they will succeed, but also believe they have to make success happen—through things like careful planning and choosing the right strategies. They recognize the need for giving serious thought to how they will deal with obstacles. This preparation only increases their confidence in their own ability to get things done. Unrealistic optimists, on the other hand, believe that success will happen to them―that the universe will reward them for all their positive thinking, or that somehow they will be transformed overnight into the kind of person for whom obstacles don’t exist anymore.",
		"Making a small request that people will accept will naturally increase the chances of their accepting a bigger request afterwards. For instance, a salesperson might request you to sign a petition to prevent cruelty against animals. This is a very small request, and most people will do what the salesperson asks. After this, the salesperson asks you if you are interested in buying any cruelty-free cosmetics from their store. Given the fact that most people agree to the prior request to sign the petition, they will be more likely to purchase the cosmetics. They make such purchases because the salesperson takes advantage of a human tendency to be consistent in their words and actions. People want to be consistent and will keep saying yes if they have already said it once.",
		"Many studies have shown that people’s health and subjective well-being are affected by ethnic relations. Members of minority groups in general have poorer health outcomes than the majority group. But that difference remains even when obvious factors, such as social class and access to medical services are controlled for. This suggests that dominance relations have their own effect on people’s health. How could that be the case? One possible answer is stress. From multiple physiological studies, we know that encounters with members of other ethnic-racial categories, even in the relatively safe environment of laboratories, trigger stress responses. Minority individuals have many encounters with majority individuals, each of which may trigger such responses. However minimal these effects may be, their frequency may increase total stress, which would account for part of the health disadvantage of minority individuals.",
		"Ideas about how much disclosure is appropriate vary among cultures. Those born in the United States tend to be high disclosers, even showing a willingness to disclose information about themselves to strangers. This may explain why Americans seem particularly easy to meet and are good at cocktail­party conversation. On the other hand, Japanese tend to do little disclosing about themselves to others except to the few people with whom they are very close. In general, Asians do not reach out to strangers. They do, however, show great care for each other, since they view harmony as essential to relationship improvement. They work hard to prevent those they view as outsiders from getting information they believe to be unfavorable.",
		"A god called Moinee was defeated by a rival god called Dromerdeener in a terrible battle up in the stars. Moinee fell out of the stars down to Tasmania to die. Before he died, he wanted to give a last blessing to his final resting place, so he decided to create humans. But he was in such a hurry, knowing he was dying, that he forgot to give them knees; and he absent­mindedly gave them big tails like kangaroos, which meant they couldn’t sit down. Then he died. The people hated having kangaroo tails and no knees, and they cried out to the heavens for help. Dromerdeener heard their cry and came down to Tasmania to see what the matter was. He took pity on the people, gave them bendable knees and cut off their inconvenient kangaroo tails so they could all sit down at last. Then they lived happily ever after.",
		"Students work to get good grades even when they have no interest in their studies. People seek job advancement even when they are happy with the jobs they already have. It’s like being in a crowded football stadium, watching the crucial play. A spectator several rows in front stands up to get a better view, and a chain reaction follows. Soon everyone is standing, just to be able to see as well as before. Everyone is on their feet rather than sitting, but no one’s position has improved. And if someone refuses to stand, he might just as well not be at the game at all. When people pursue goods that are positional, they can’t help being in the rat race. To choose not to run is to lose.",
		"When we compare human and animal desire we find many extraordinary differences. Animals tend to eat with their stomachs, and humans with their brains. When animals’ stomachs are full, they stop eating, but humans are never sure when to stop. When they have eaten as much as their bellies can take, they still feel empty, they still feel an urge for further gratification. This is largely due to anxiety, to the knowledge that a constant supply of food is uncertain. Therefore, they eat as much as possible while they can. It is due, also, to the knowledge that, in an insecure world, pleasure is uncertain. Therefore, the immediate pleasure of eating must be exploited to the full, even though it does violence to the digestion. ",
		"We make decisions based on what we think we know. It wasn’t too long ago that the majority of people believed the world was flat. This perceived truth impacted behavior. During this period, there was very little exploration. People feared that if they traveled too far they might fall off the edge of the earth. So for the most part they didn’t dare to travel. It wasn’t until that minor detail was revealed─the world is round─that behaviors changed on a massive scale. Upon this discovery, societies began to travel across the planet. Trade routes were established; spices were traded. New ideas, like mathematics, were shared between societies which allowed for all kinds of innovations and advancements. The correction of a simple false assumption moved the human race forward.",
		"Mirrors and other smooth, shiny surfaces reflect light. We see reflections from such surfaces because the rays of light form an image on the retina of our eyes. Such images are always reversed. Look at yourself in a mirror, wink your right eye and your left eye seems to wink back at you. You can use a mirror to send a coded message to a friend. Stand a mirror upright on the table, so that a piece of paper on the table can be clearly seen in the mirror. Now write a message that looks right when you look in the mirror. Keep your eyes on the reflected image while you are writing and not on your paper. After a little practice, it will be easier to write “backwards.” When your friend receives such a message he will be able to read it by holding the paper up to a mirror.",
		"Imagine yourself at a party. It is dark and a group of friends ask you to take a picture of them. You grab your camera, point, and shoot your friends. The camera automatically turns on the flash as there is not enough light available to produce a correct exposure. The result is half of your friends appear in the picture with two bright red circles instead of their eyes. This is a common problem called the red-eye effect. It is caused because the light from the flash penetrates the eyes through the pupils, and then gets reflected to the camera from the back of the eyes where a large amount of blood is present. This blood is the reason why the eyes look red in the photograph. This effect is more noticeable when there is not much light in the environment. This is because pupils dilate when it is dark, allowing more light to get inside the eye and producing a larger red-eye effect.",
		"Even though two variables seem to be related, there may not be a causal relationship. In fact, the two variables may merely seem to be associated with each other due to the effect of some third variable. Sociologists call such misleading relationships spurious. A classic example is the apparent association between children’s shoe size and reading ability. It seems that as shoe size increases, reading ability improves. Does this mean that the size of one’s feet (independent variable) causes an improvement in reading skills (dependent variable)? Certainly not. This false relationship is caused by a third factor, age, that is related to shoe size as well as reading ability. Hence, when researchers attempt to make causal claims about the relationship between an independent and a dependent variable, they must control for―or rule out― other variables that may be creating a spurious relationship.",
		"Almost all major sporting activities are played with a ball. The rules of the game always include rules about the type of ball that is allowed, starting with the size and weight of the ball. The ball must also have a certain stiffness. A ball might have the correct size and weight but if it is made as a hollow ball of steel it will be too stiff and if it is made from light foam rubber with a heavy center it will be too soft. Similarly, along with stiffness, a ball needs to bounce properly. A solid rubber ball would be too bouncy for most sports, and a solid ball made of clay would not bounce at all.",
		"If you had to write a math equation, you probably wouldn’t write, “Twenty­eight plus fourteen equals forty­two.” It would take too long to write and it would be hard to read quickly. You would write, “28+14=42.” Chemistry is the same way. Chemists have to write chemical equations all the time, and it would take too long to write and read if they had to spell everything out. So chemists use symbols, just like we do in math. A chemical formula lists all the elements that form each molecule and uses a small number to the bottom right of an element’s symbol to stand for the number of atoms of that element.  For example, the chemical formula for water is HO2. That tells us that a water molecule is made up of two hydrogen (“H” and “2”) atoms and one oxygen (“O”) atom.",
		"Starting from birth, babies are immediately attracted to faces. Scientists were able to show this by having babies look at two simple images, one that looks more like a face than the other. By measuring where the babies looked, scientists found that the babies looked at the face­like image more than they looked at the non­face image. Even though babies have poor eyesight, they prefer to look at faces. But why? One reason babies might like faces is because of something called evolution. Evolution involves changes to the structures of an organism(such as the brain) that occur over many generations. These changes help the organisms to survive, making them alert to enemies. By being able to recognize faces from afar or in the dark, humans were able to know someone was coming and protect themselves from possible danger.",
		"People spend much of their time interacting with media, but that does not mean that people have the critical skills to analyze and understand it. One well­known study from Stanford University in 2016 demonstrated that youth are easily fooled by misinformation, especially when it comes through social media channels. This weakness is not found only in youth, however. Research from New York University found that people over 65 shared seven times as much misinformation as their younger counterparts. All of this raises a question: What’s the solution to the misinformation problem? Governments and tech platforms certainly have a role to play in blocking misinformation. However, every individual needs to take responsibility for combating this threat by becoming more information literate.",
		"Understanding how to develop respect for and a knowledge of other cultures begins with reexamining the golden rule: “I treat others in the way I want to be treated.” This rule makes sense on some level; if we treat others as well as we want to be treated, we will be treated well in return. This rule works well in a monocultural setting, where everyone is working within the same cultural framework. In a multicultural setting, however, where words, gestures, beliefs, and views may have different meanings, this rule has an unintended result; it can send a message that my culture is better than yours. It can also create a frustrating situation where we believe we are doing what is right, but what we are doing is not being interpreted in the way in which it was meant. This miscommunication can lead to problems.",
		"In a study, a researcher pretending to be a volunteer surveyed a California neighborhood, asking residents if they would allow a large sign reading ‘‘Drive Carefully’’ to be displayed on their front lawns. To help them understand what it would look like, the volunteer showed his participants a picture of the large sign blocking the view of a beautiful house. Naturally, most people refused, but in one particular group, an incredible 76 percent actually approved. The reason that they agreed was this: two weeks earlier, these residents had been asked by another volunteer to make a small commitment to display a tiny sign that read ‘‘Be a Safe Driver’’ in their windows. Since it was such a small and simple request, nearly all of them agreed. The astonishing result was that the initial small commitment deeply influenced their willingness to accept the much larger request two weeks later.",
		"Roughly twenty years ago, brick-and-mortar stores began to give way to electronic commerce. For good or bad, the shift fundamentally changed consumers’ perception of the shopping experience. Nowhere was the shift more obvious than with book sales, which is how online bookstores got their start. Physical bookstores simply could not stock as many titles as a virtual bookstore could. There is only so much space available on a shelf. In addition to greater variety, online bookstores were also able to offer aggressive discounts thanks to their lower operating costs. The combination of lower prices and greater selection led to the slow, steady rise of online bookstores. Before long, the e-commerce book market naturally expanded to include additional categories, like CDs and DVDs. E-commerce soon snowballed into the enormous industry it is today, where you can buy everything from toilet paper to cars online.",
		"Literary works, by their nature, suggest rather than explain; they imply rather than state their claims boldly and directly. This broad generalization, however, does not mean that works of literature do not include direct statements. Depending on when they were written and by whom, literary works may contain large amounts of direct telling and lesser amounts of suggestion and implication. But whatever the proportion of a work’s showing to telling, there is always something for readers to interpret. Thus we ask the question “What does the text suggest?” as a way to approach literary interpretation, as a way to begin thinking about a text’s implications. What a text implies is often of great interest to us. And our work of figuring out a text’s implications tests our analytical powers. In considering what a text suggests, we gain practice in making sense of texts. ",
		"Toward the end of the 19th century, a new architectural attitude emerged. Industrial architecture, the argument went, was ugly and inhuman; past styles had more to do with pretension than what people needed in their homes. Instead of these approaches, why not look at the way ordinary country builders worked in the past? They developed their craft skills over generations, demonstrating mastery of both tools and materials. Those materials were local, and used with simplicity— houses built this way had plain wooden floors and whitewashed walls inside. But they supplied people’s needs perfectly and, at their best, had a beauty that came from the craftsman’s skill and the rootedness of the house in its locality.",
		"Robert Schumann once said, “The laws of morals are those of art.” What the great man is saying here is that there is good music and bad music. The greatest music, even if it’s tragic in nature, takes us to a world higher than ours; somehow the beauty uplifts us. Bad music, on the other hand, degrades us. It’s the same with performances: a bad performance isn’t necessarily the result of incompetence. Some of the worst performances occur when the performers, no matter how accomplished, are thinking more of themselves than of the music they’re playing. These doubtful characters aren’t really listening to what the composer is saying—they’re just showing off, hoping that they’ll have a great ‘success’ with the public. The performer’s basic task is to try to understand the meaning of the music, and then to communicate it honestly to others.",
		"Mrs. Klein told her first graders to draw a picture of something to be thankful for. She thought that most of the class would draw turkeys or Thanksgiving tables. But Douglas drew something different. Douglas was a boy who usually spent time alone and stayed around her while his classmates went outside together during break time. What the boy drew was a hand. But whose hand? His image immediately attracted the other students’ interest. So, everyone rushed to talk about whose hand it was. “It must be the hand of God that brings us food,” said one student. “A farmer’s,” said a second student, “because they raise the turkeys.” “It looks more like a police officer’s,” added another, “they protect us.” The class was so responsive that Mrs. Klein had almost forgotten about Douglas. After she had the others at work on another project, she asked Douglas whose hand it was. He answered softly, “It’s yours. Thank you, Mrs. Klein.”",
		"According to legend, once a vampire bites a person, that person turns into a vampire who seeks the blood of others. A researcher came up with some simple math, which proves that these highly popular creatures can’t exist. University of Central Florida physics professor Costas Efthimiou’s work breaks down the myth. Suppose that on January 1st, 1600, the human population was just over five hundred million. If the first vampire came into existence that day and bit one person a month, there would have been two vampires by February 1st, 1600. A month later there would have been four, the next month eight, then sixteen, and so on. In just two­and­a­half years, the original human population would all have become vampires with no humans left. But look around you. Have vampires taken over the world? No, because there’s no such thing.",
		"With nearly a billion hungry people in the world, there is obviously no single cause. So the problem really is that food is, in the grand scheme of things, too expensive and many people are too poor to buy it. The answer will be in continuing the trend of lowering the cost of food. However, far and away the biggest cause is poverty. Seventy­nine percent of the world’s hungry live in nations that are net exporters of food. How can this be? The reason people are hungry in those countries is that the products produced there can be sold on the world market for more than the local citizens can afford to pay for them. In the modern age you do not starve because you have no food, you starve because you have no money.",
		"Most people have a perfect time of day when they feel they are at their best, whether in the morning, evening, or afternoon. Some of us are night owls, some early birds, and others in between may feel most active during the afternoon hours. If you are able to organize your day and divide your work, make it a point to deal with tasks that demand attention at your best time of the day. When your mind and body are less alert than at your “peak” hours, the muse of creativity awakens and is allowed to roam more freely. In other words, when your mental machinery is loose rather than standing at attention, the creativity flows. However, if the task you face demands creativity and novel ideas, it’s best to tackle it at your “worst” time of day! So if you are an early bird, make sure to attack your creative task in the evening, and vice versa for night owls.",
		"Things are changing. It has been reported that 42 percent of jobs in Canada are at risk, and 62 percent of jobs in America will be in danger due to advances in automation. You might say that the numbers seem a bit unrealistic, but the threat is real. One fast food franchise has a robot that can flip a burger in ten seconds. It is just a simple task but the robot could replace an entire crew. Highly skilled jobs are also at risk. A supercomputer, for instance, can suggest available treatments for specific illnesses in an automated way, drawing on the body of medical research and data on diseases. However, what’s difficult to automate is the ability to creatively solve problems. Whereas workers in “doing” roles can be replaced by robots, the role of creatively solving problems is more dependent on an irreplaceable individual.",
		"Each beech tree grows in a particular location and soil conditions can vary greatly in just a few yards. The soil can have a great deal of water or almost no water. It can be full of nutrients or not. Accordingly, each tree grows more quickly or more slowly and produces more or less sugar, and thus you would expect every tree to be photosynthesizing at a different rate. However, the rate is the same. Whether they are thick or thin, all the trees of the same species are using light to produce the same amount of sugar per leaf. Some trees have plenty of sugar and some have less, but the trees equalize this difference between them by transferring sugar. This is taking place underground through the roots. Whoever has an abundance of sugar hands some over; whoever is running short gets help. Their network acts as a system to make sure that no trees fall too far behind.",
		"In the Old Stone Age, small bands of 20 to 60 people wandered from place to place in search of food. Once people began farming, they could settle down near their farms. As a result, towns and villages grew larger. Living in communities allowed people to organize themselves more efficiently. They could divide up the work of producing food and other things they needed. While some workers grew crops, others built new houses and made tools. Village dwellers also learned to work together to do a task faster. For example, toolmakers could share the work of making stone axes and knives. By working together, they could make more tools in the same amount of time.",
		"Natural processes form minerals in many ways. For example, hot melted rock material, called magma, cools when it reaches the Earth’s surface, or even if it’s trapped below the surface. As magma cools, its atoms lose heat energy, move closer together, and begin to combine into compounds. During this process, atoms of the different compounds arrange themselves into orderly, repeating patterns. The type and amount of elements present in a magma partly determine which minerals will form. Also, the size of the crystals that form depends partly on how rapidly the magma cools. When magma cools slowly, the crystals that form are generally large enough to see with the unaided eye. This is because the atoms have enough time to move together and form into larger crystals. When magma cools rapidly, the crystals that form will be small. In such cases, you can’t easily see individual mineral crystals.",
		"Up until about 6,000 years ago, most people were farmers. Many lived in different places throughout the year, hunting for food or moving their livestock to areas with enough food. There was no need to tell the time because life depended on natural cycles, such as the changing seasons or sunrise and sunset. Gradually more people started to live in larger settlements, and some needed to tell the time. For example, priests wanted to know when to carry out religious ceremonies. This was when people first invented clocks―devices that show, measure, and keep track of passing time. Clocks have been important ever since. Today, clocks are used for important things such as setting busy airport timetables―if the time is incorrect, aeroplanes might crash into each other when taking off or landing!",
		"Managers are always looking for ways to increase productivity, which is the ratio of costs to output in production. Adam Smith, writing when the manufacturing industry was new, described a way that production could be made more efficient, known as the “division of labor.” Making most manufactured goods involves several different processes using different skills. Smith’s example was the manufacture of pins: the wire is straightened, sharpened, a head is put on, and then it is polished. One worker could do all these tasks, and make 20 pins in a day. But this work can be divided into its separate processes, with a number of workers each performing one task. Because each worker specializes in one job, he or she can work much faster without changing from one task to another. Now 10 workers can produce thousands of pins in a day—a huge increase in productivity from the 200 they would have produced before.",
		"Maybe you’ve heard this joke: “How do you eat an elephant?” The answer is “one bite at a time.” So, how do you “build” the Earth? That’s simple, too: one atom at a time. Atoms are the basic building blocks of crystals, and since all rocks are made up of crystals, the more you know about atoms, the better. Crystals come in a variety of shapes that scientists call habits. Common crystal habits include squares, triangles, and six­sided hexagons. Usually crystals form when liquids cool, such as when you create ice cubes. Many times, crystals form in ways that do not allow for perfect shapes. If conditions are too cold, too hot, or there isn’t enough source material, they can form strange, twisted shapes. But when conditions are right, we see beautiful displays. Usually, this involves a slow, steady environment where the individual atoms have plenty of time to join and fit perfectly into what’s known as the crystal lattice. This is the basic structure of atoms that is seen time after time.",
		"When you pluck a guitar string it moves back and forth hundreds of times every second. Naturally, this movement is so fast that you cannot see it—you just see the blurred outline of the moving string. Strings vibrating in this way on their own make hardly any noise because strings are very thin and don’t push much air about. But if you attach a string to a big hollow box (like a guitar body), then the vibration is amplified and the note is heard loud and clear. The vibration of the string is passed on to the wooden panels of the guitar body, which vibrate back and forth at the same rate as the string. The vibration of the wood creates more powerful waves in the air pressure, which travel away from the guitar. When the waves reach your eardrums they flex in and out the same number of times a second as the original string.",
		"The adolescent brain is not fully developed until its early twenties. This means the way the adolescents’ decision-making circuits integrate and process information may put them at a disadvantage. One of their brain regions that matures later is the prefrontal cortex, which is the control center, tasked with thinking ahead and evaluating consequences. It is the area of the brain responsible for preventing you from sending off an initial angry text and modifying it with kinder words. On the other hand, the limbic system matures earlier, playing a central role in processing emotional responses. Because of its earlier development, it is more likely to influence decision-making. Decision-making in the adolescent brain is led by emotional factors more than the perception of consequences. Due to these differences, there is an imbalance between feeling-based decision-making ruled by the more mature limbic system and logical-based decision-making by the not-yet-mature prefrontal cortex. This may explain why some teens are more likely to make bad decisions.",
		"Despite the remarkable progress in deep-learning based facial recognition approaches in recent years, in terms of identification performance, they still have limitations. These limitations relate to the database used in the learning stage. If the selected database does not contain enough instances, the result may be systematically affected. For example, the performance of a facial biometric system may decrease if the person to be identified was enrolled over 10 years ago. The factor to consider is that this person may experience changes in the texture of the face, particularly with the appearance of wrinkles and sagging skin. These changes may be highlighted by weight gain or loss. To counteract this problem, researchers have developed models for face aging or digital de-aging. It is used to compensate for the differences in facial characteristics, which appear over a given time period.",
		"In many sports, people realized the difficulties and even impossibilities of young children participating fully in many adult sport environments. They found the road to success for young children is unlikely if they play on adult fields, courts or arenas with equipment that is too large, too heavy or too fast for them to handle while trying to compete in adult­style competition. Common sense has prevailed: different sports have made adaptations for children. As examples, baseball has T ball, football has flag football and junior soccer uses a smaller and lighter ball and (sometimes) a smaller field. All have junior competitive structures where children play for shorter time periods and often in smaller teams. In a similar way, tennis has adapted the court areas, balls and rackets to make them more appropriate for children under 10. The adaptations are progressive and relate to the age of the child.",
		"With no horses available, the Inca empire excelled at delivering messages on foot. The messengers were stationed on the royal roads to deliver the Inca king’s orders and reports coming from his lands. Called Chasquis, they lived in groups of four to six in huts, placed from one to two miles apart along the roads. They were all young men and especially good runners who watched the road in both directions. If they caught sight of another messenger coming, they hurried out to meet them. The Inca built the huts on high ground, in sight of one another. When a messenger neared the next hut, he began to call out and repeated the message three or four times to the one who was running out to meet him. The Inca empire could relay messages 1,000miles (1,610km) in three or four days under good conditions.",
		"In general, there are two major styles of practice when it comes to medicine. In the past, the relationship between the doctors and patients was mostly paternalistic. In other words, doctors acted in a “father knows best” fashion. In this type of relationship, the doctor told what needed to be done, and the patient followed it without asking a lot of questions. This style of medicine allowed only for one­way communication. The other style of medical practice can be described as informative. As the paternalistic style slowly goes out of favor with the general public, the informative style is gradually taking hold as the more common type of doctor­patient relationship. The doctor’s task in this case is not to tell what to do but to educate the patient about various treatment options. Ultimately, the doctor allows his patients to reach an informed decision about their own health conditions.",
		"You may know the classic myth of Icarus and Daedalus. The tale is tragic and it reminds us that our safety requires obedience, especially to our parents when we are not yet adults. It’s easy to forget that our parents often know better, but they do. Though our parents might seem out of step with the times, they have a great deal more wisdom and experience. However, not all of us who pursue our dreams are so reckless as to do something dangerous, just as Icarus flew too close to the sun. As we mature, we know that we must balance courage with caution. At the same time, we know that if everyone were motivated by fear, then nothing creative or progressive would ever be achieved. Therefore, we try to respect and keep alive our dreams and aspirations.

		"Here’s a fascinating social experiment. Select one hundred people at random in New York City and ask them each to list all their friends, so you can figure out their average number of friends. Then, in turn, ask their friends how many friends they have. You will find that the latter’s average number of friends is higher. Sociologist Scott Feld of Purdue University drew attention to this apparent paradox. The explanation lies in the realization that there is a bias in the question being asked, since you are more likely to know popular people and less likely to know unpopular ones. That is also why people at your local gym tend to be fitter than you, because you do not encounter the relatively out­of­shape ones who rarely turn up.",
		"The tank was a British invention. Early in the war inventors came to the army leaders with the idea but the army rejected it as impractical. However, Winston Churchill, head of the navy, thought the idea had potential and his department funded its development. Two years later the tanks were used for the first time at the Battle of the Somme. They advanced ahead of the infantry, crushing defences and spraying the enemy with machine­gun fire. They caused alarm among the Germans and raised the morale of the British troops. Surely this was the weapon that could achieve a breakthrough! However, these first machines only moved at walking pace. More than half of them broke down before they got to the German trenches. They were not very reliable. It was not until a year later that tanks actually achieved great success. They blasted through enemy lines so quickly that the infantry could not keep up.",
		"Dieter Rams, a German industrial designer, is driven by the idea that almost everything is noise. He believes very few things are essential. His job is to filter through that noise until he gets to the essence. For example, when he was the lead designer at a company, he was asked to collaborate on a record player. The norm at the time was to cover the turntable in a solid wooden lid or even to incorporate the player into a piece of living room furniture. Instead, he and his team removed the clutter and designed a player with a clear plastic cover on the top and nothing more. It was the first time such a design had been used, and it was so revolutionary that people worried it might bankrupt the company because nobody would buy it. It took courage, as it always does, to eliminate the non-essential. By the sixties this aesthetic started to become more and more popular. In time it became the design every other record player followed.",
		"A Greek historian Herodotus wrote of cinnamon which he had learned about from the Phoenicians. The Phoenicians had claimed that cinnamon sticks were brought to Arabia by large birds that carried them to their nests on mountain cliffs. In order to get the cinnamon, Arabians cut up the bodies of large animals and placed them on the ground near the nests. When the birds picked up the food and returned to their nest, the weight of the meat broke the nest and the cinnamon fell down the mountain, where the Arabians ran to pick it up. The spice was then exported to other countries. This story is perhaps unlikely. For those who traded this spice to people from far­off lands, however, such an exaggerated tale of hardship may have increased a product’s value to the consumer.",
		"When you purchase an item, you are paying not just for the item, but the costs to get that item to you. Let’s say you visit a farm and buy a tomato. It might cost the farmer very little to grow a tomato, so the farmer might be able to sell you a tomato for much less than it would cost in the supermarket and still make a nice profit. When you buy that tomato at a supermarket, however, there are a number of costs that result in you paying much more than you would pay the farmer. That tomato has to be transported to the store; the store must pay rent, electric bills, and employee wages; and the store advertises tomatoes in its weekly newspaper ad.",
		"The subjective approach to probability is based mostly on opinions, feelings, or hopes. Therefore, we don’t typically use this approach in real scientific attempts. Although the actual probability that the Ohio State football team will win the national championship is out there somewhere, no one knows what it is. Some fans will have ideas about what that chance is based on how much they love or hate Ohio State. Other people will take a slightly more scientific approach―evaluating players’ stats, analyzing all the statistics of the Ohio State team over the last 100 years, looking at the strength of the competition, and so on. But the probability of an event in either case is mostly subjective, and although this approach isn’t scientific, it sure makes for some great sports talk amongst the fans.",
		"Keith Chen, a professor at Yale, had a question about what would happen if he could teach a group of monkeys to use money. Chen went to work with seven male monkeys at a lab. When Chen gave a monkey a coin, he sniffed it and, after determining he couldn’t eat it, he tossed it aside. When Chen repeated this, the monkey started tossing the coin at him. So Chen gave the monkey a coin and then showed a treat. Whenever the monkey gave the coin back to Chen, he got the treat. It took months, but the monkeys eventually learned that the coins could buy the treats. Once they learned how to use the coins, it turned out that individual monkeys had strong preferences for different treats. The monkey would exchange his coins for whichever food he preferred.",
		"The potential of access to a particular medium is shaped by the technological characteristics of the medium concerned. Access to TV sets and telephones is not the same as access to computers and networks. All media have characteristics supporting and discouraging access. Computers and their networks support access because they are multi­purpose or multi­functional technologies enabling all kinds of information, communication, transaction, work, education and entertainment. So, there are useful applications for everybody. Moreover, the extension of networks produces network effects: the more people gain access, the more valuable a connection becomes. However, multi­functionality also results in extremely different applications, both advanced, with many opportunities to learn and build a career, and simple, mainly focused on entertainment. Other characteristics decreasing equality of access are the complexity, expensiveness and lack of user­friendliness of many contemporary new media.",
		"In a crowded world, an unmanaged commons cannot possibly work. That is an important qualification. If the world is not crowded, a commons may in fact be the best method of distribution. For example, when the pioneers spread out across the United States, the most efficient way was to treat all the game in the wild as an unmanaged commons because for a long time humans couldn’t do any real damage. A plainsman could kill an American bison, cut out only the tongue for his dinner, and discard the rest of the animal. He was not being wasteful in any important sense. Nor did it much matter how a lonely American frontiersman disposed of his waste. Today, with only a few thousand bison left, we would be outraged by such careless behavior. As the population in the United States became denser, the land’s natural chemical and biological recycling processes were overloaded. Careful management of these resources became necessary, from bison to oil and water.",
		"Applying a single plan to everything can be inefficient and sometimes comical. Perhaps you remember the folktale about the lazy son who gets scolded by his mother for losing the money he received as payment from a farmer. “Next time you get paid,” his mother says sternly, “be sure to carry it home in your pocket.” But the following day the boy goes to work for a dairy farmer, who pays him with a pail of milk instead of money. Anxious not to anger his mother, the boy dutifully pours the milk into his pocket. Although his mother’s plan was good, it could work only when used in the right circumstance. The same idea applies to your study plans. For example, writing out your notes in full sentences makes sense if the goal is to study a textbook. But if you used the same plan for taking lecture notes, you’d move so slowly that you’d miss most of what the instructor said. The secret is to find a plan that fits your goal.",
		"Composition is not just about framing the picture, it is also pressing the camera shutter at exactly the right moment. Get the timing wrong, and the picture may well lose some of its energy. For some subjects, the key times at which to take pictures are obvious, such as the moment when a winner crosses the finishing line. On such occasions, preparation and practice count as much as good luck.But with other, less predictable, events there can be magical moments―when constantly changing conditions and people suddenly come together to create a strong, beautiful, energetic composition. Such moments might be when two or more elements combine in a certain way. On a stormy day, for example, a beautiful building might suddenly be illuminated by a shaft of light, creating a moody scene that might never be recaptured. To make the most of these decisive moments requires patience and the vision to see what might happen, even before it presents itself in the viewfinder.  ",
		"For some people, there is an irony to success. Many people who achieve great success don’t always feel it. For example, some who achieve fame talk about the loneliness that often goes with it. That’s because success and achievement are not the same thing, yet too often we mistake one for the other. Achievement is something you reach or attain, like a goal. It is something tangible, clearly defined and measurable. It comes when you pursue and obtain what you want. Success, in contrast, is a feeling or a state of being. “She feels successful. She is successful,” we say, using the verb to be to suggest this state of being.",
		"Every day in each of my classes I randomly select two students who are given the title of “official questioners.” These students are assigned the responsibility to ask at least one question during that class. After being the day’s official questioner, one of my students, Carrie, visited me in my office. Just to break the ice, I asked in a lighthearted way, “Did you feel honored to be named one of the first ‘official questioners’ of the semester?” In a serious tone, she answered that she’d been extremely nervous when I appointed her at the beginning of class. But then, during that class, she felt differently from how she’d felt during other lectures. It was a lecture just like the others, but this time, she said, she was forced to have a higher level of consciousness; she was more aware of the content of the lecture and discussion. She also admitted that as a result she got more out of that class.",
		"There are things we simply cannot see or hear. Many stars are beyond our gaze, and we can’t see atoms, or even the tiny creatures in puddles of rain water. We can’t hear sounds that many birds or mice can. But we can still learn about them, asking questions and using instruments that let us see or hear far better than with our eyes or ears alone. Just as telescopes let us see further into space, microscopes help us see further into the tiny building blocks of living creatures. In the seventeenth century, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek used his small microscopes to look at blood cells and the hairs on a fly’s legs. A century later, more advanced microscopes were allowing naturalists to examine these finer details of anatomy and the wonderful array of tiny life.",
		"To learn about the nature and location of memory, scientists in the 1940s began their search for memory in the most obvious place: within the cells of our brains― our neurons. They cut out parts of rats’ brains, trying to make them forget a maze, and found that it didn’t matter what part of the brain they chose; the rats never forgot. In 1950, the researchers gave up, concluding that memory must be somewhere else. Researchers eventually turned their search for memories to the wiring between neurons rather than within the cells themselves. Each of the hundred billion neurons in our brains is connected to seven thousand other neurons, in a dense web of nerve fibers. These interconnected webs are intricately involved in our memories. The memory the rats had of the maze was spread throughout their brains. Whenever the scientists cut out a piece, they damaged only a small portion of the involved connections.",
		"Evolution did not give humans the ability to play soccer. True, it produced legs for kicking and elbows for fouling, but all that this enables us to do is perhaps practice penalty kicks alone. To get into a game with the strangers we find in the schoolyard on any given afternoon, we not only have to work in concert with ten teammates we may never have met before, we also need to know that the eleven players on the opposing team are playing by the same rules. Other animals that engage strangers in ritualized aggression do so largely by instinct—puppies throughout the world have the rules for rough­and­tumble play built into their genes. But human teenagers have no such genes for soccer. They can nevertheless play the game with complete strangers because they have all learned an identical set of ideas about soccer. These ideas are entirely imaginary, but if everyone shares them, we can all play the game.",
		"The foragers’ secret of success, which protected them from starvation and malnutrition, was their varied diet. Farmers tend to eat a very limited and unbalanced diet. Especially in pre­modern times, most of the calories feeding an agricultural population came from a single crop ―such as wheat, potatoes, or rice―that lacks some of the vitamins, minerals, and other nutritional materials humans need. The typical peasant in traditional China ate rice for breakfast, rice for lunch, and rice for dinner. If she was lucky, she could expect to eat the same on the following day. By contrast, ancient foragers regularly ate dozens of different foodstuffs. The peasant’s ancient ancestor, the forager, may have eaten berries and mushrooms for breakfast; fruits and snails for lunch; and rabbit steak with wild onions for dinner. Tomorrow’s menu might have been completely different. This variety ensured that the ancient foragers received all the necessary nutrients.",
		"Land is always a scarce resource in urban development; high building density, by providing more built­-up space on individual sites, can maximize the utilization of the scarce urban land. High building density, therefore, helps to reduce the pressure to develop open spaces and releases more land for communal facilities and services to improve the quality of urban living. However, some people argue that the opposite is also true. In order to achieve high building density, massive high­-rise buildings are inevitable, and these massive structures, crammed into small sites, can conversely result in very little open space and a congested cityscape. This may happen when high­-density development is carried out without planning. Therefore, in order to avoid the negative impacts of high density, thorough planning and appropriate density control are essential.",
		"Music is a specialized branch of learning, at least as it applies to the musician. While we might expect that members of society who take part in singing only as members of a larger group may learn their music through imitation, musicianship, seen as a special skill, usually requires more directed learning. It may be added that in any society an individual learns only a small portion of his cultural habits by free trial­-and­-error, for in this way he would learn only those habits which were most rewarding to him and to him alone. Such indiscriminate and selfish learning cannot be allowed by society; the individual must learn behavior which is specified in the culture as being correct or best. Such behavior is, of course, the result of the learning process as carried on by previous generations. Behaviors which are successful have persisted in the form of customs, while those which are unsuccessful have suffered extinction. This accumulation of adaptive habits is passed on to the child; he does not simply learn through imitation how to get along in the world; rather, he is enculturated.",
		"People absorb iron best when it comes together with something else we readily absorb―for example, vitamin C. Vegetarians use this trick to boost their iron absorption. By combining sources of iron with sources of vitamin C, they can ensure that their bodies are better able to absorb both. A large dose of vitamin C can increase iron absorption sixfold. Unfortunately, the opposite is also true. A diet poor in vitamin C makes iron absorption difficult, often leading to the double bad luck of scurvy and anemia. Just imagine that combination. It’s bad enough that you are pale and exhausted, but you could also lose muscle tone and begin bleeding internally. Vegetarians in developed countries avoid these fatal symptoms because they have access to many foods that are high in both iron and vitamin C, such as broccoli and spinach. Poor people in the developing world are usually less fortunate, however, as those key foods are often precious and strictly seasonal.",
		"A change in motivation can be effected by targeting the physical consequences of various actions. This method is not at all automatic for most people. In general, people accept and deal with the set consequences of their actions prescribed by their surroundings. It is, however, possible for a person to personally manipulate and create consequences for his actions. This will inevitably have an effect on his future motivation and behavior. Most often this is achieved through the imposition of monetary consequences. A bet is a typical example of this. A person striving to reach a difficult goal or complete a task―building a rocking chair or losing weight, for instance―will be wise to supplement his motivation to do so by making a bet on it with a friend. He would of course bet in favor of himself. In doing so, he will receive both a positive incentive to complete the task (his desire to collect the reward for winning the bet) and a negative disincentive to quit the task (his desire to avoid having to pay out if he loses).",
		"The email inbox environment has changed―that much is undeniable. But people are amazingly adaptable. Just as they have adapted to changes everywhere else in their world, they will adapt to changes in email practices. Think back about thirty years, when there were only three or four networks on television. Back then, parents could leave their children in front of the set without having to worry about what they’d see. Today, leave kids alone in front of the set with a remote control in their hands, and they’re likely to be exposed to explosions, bloody fights, and some rather provocative views of the human body. So what did parents do? They adapted. They took away the remote. They purchased parental­-lock technology. They began to watch with their children. People haven’t turned off their TVs, just as they will not stop reading email. They will continue to develop simple techniques that will enable them to manage ever­-increasing volumes of irrelevant email.",
		"In classic experiments on stress, people performed tasks that required concentration, like solving puzzles, while being blasted at random intervals with uncomfortably loud sounds. They started sweating and their heart rates and blood pressure climbed. They struggled to focus and made mistakes. Many got so frustrated that they gave up. Searching for a way to reduce anxiety, researchers gave some of the participants an escape. If the noise became too unpleasant, they could press a button and make it stop. Sure enough, the button allowed them to stay calmer, make fewer mistakes, and show less irritation. That’s nothing surprising. But here’s what is: none of the participants actually pressed the button. Stopping the noise didn’t make the difference...knowing they could stop the noise did. The button gave them a sense of control and allowed them to endure the stress.",
		"People treat children in a variety of ways: care for them, punish them, love them, neglect them, teach them. If parents, relatives, and other agents of socialization perceive a child as smart, they will act toward him or her that way. Thus, the child eventually comes to believe he or she is a smart person. One of the earliest symbolic interactionists, Charles Horton Cooley, argued that we use the reaction of others toward us as mirrors in which we see ourselves and determine our self­-worth. Through this process, we imagine how we might look to other people, we interpret their responses to us, and we form a self­-concept. If we think people perceive us favorably, we’re likely to develop a positive self­-concept. Conversely, if we detect unfavorable reactions, our self­-concept will likely be negative. Hence, self­-evaluative feelings such as pride or shame are always the product of the reflected appraisals of others.",
		"Where does one start when writing the history of water management? People, Homo sapiens and our past ancestors and relatives, must always have been managing water in some manner as far back as six million years, the date at which we shared a common ancestor with the chimpanzee. Chimpanzees are known to crumple up leaves to use as sponges for transporting water from hollow tree trunks to their mouths; we must assume that our ancestors were not only doing the same but carrying water short distances, whether cupped in their hands, within folded leaves or in skin containers. While we lack any direct archaeological evidence for such water carrying, it is implied by the remains of camping or activity sites found in locations distant from water sources. Such evidence is itself problematic, however, because sufficiently detailed environmental reconstructions to pinpoint the specific location of a river course or the nearest pool of standing water are difficult for the earliest periods of prehistory.",
		"Building resilience depends on the opportunities children have and the relationships they form with parents, caregivers, teachers, and friends. We can start by helping children develop four core beliefs: they have some control over their lives; they can learn from failure; they matter as human beings; and they have real strengths to rely on and share. These four beliefs have a real impact on kids. One study tracked hundreds of at­-risk children for three decades. They grew up in environments with severe poverty, alcohol abuse, or mental illness, and two out of three developed serious problems by adolescence and adulthood. Yet despite these extreme hardships, a third of the kids matured into “competent, confident, and caring young adults” with no record of delinquency or mental health problems. These resilient children shared something: they felt a strong sense of control over their lives. They saw themselves as the masters of their own fate and viewed negative events not as threats but as challenges and even opportunities.",
		"Most scientists attribute extraordinary memory performance to an enhanced ability to associate or organize the information to be memorized, rather than true photographic memory. For example, many expert chess players possess a remarkable capacity to recall the position of chess pieces at any point from a game. The ability to retain an accurate mental image of the chessboard permits these players to play multiple boards at a time―even while they are blindfolded! It was not surprising, then, when researchers observed that expert chess players have a much greater aptitude to remember chessboard patterns compared to test subjects who do not play chess. However, if researchers challenged the expert chess players with randomly generated board patterns, the expert players were no better than novice chess players at recalling chessboard patterns. Thus, by changing the “rules” of the game, researchers revealed that the remarkable capacity of these players to memorize visual information specific to chess (possibly the very reason these individuals are gifted at chess) was not the equivalent of photographic memory.",
		"There are times when we hold contradictory views and we know it, at least at one of the deeper levels of consciousness. Most of us could not comfortably live with ourselves if we made a habit of holding flatly contradictory statements at the forefront of our consciousness. For example, I could not explicitly say to myself “I tell many deliberate lies to Stephanie” and “I never lie to Stephanie.” What I do, assuming the first statement reflects objective facts, is suppress the second statement. Another way I can allow myself to hold on to statements that contradict the facts is deliberately to refrain from examining the facts to which the statements refer. This attitude is expressed by the quip “Don’t bother me with the facts; I’ve already made up my mind.” Mental operations of these kinds are not so much instances of reasoning as evasion of reasoning. Obviously, this can have nothing to do with logic. Those forms of unhealthy reasoning can be known as “rationalization.” Rationalization is reasoning in the service of falsehood.",
		"Centuries of technological advances have created possibilities where few or none existed before. At their most basic, technologies allow people, if sufficiently armed with capital, to partially overcome their local geography and make it productive. The more difficult that geography, the more expensive it is to make it useful, and the more expensive to keep it useful. Economic and social development, then, are about figuring out how to use technology and capital, to find out not only what is possible but also feasible. Economists call this opportunity costs. For example, you may be able to build a road to the top of the mountain to reach a remote chalet, build it strong enough to withstand spring floods, plow it to keep it open in the winter, and repair it and clear it of avalanche debris in the summer. But with those same resources you can build fifty times the length of road in flat lowlands and service several tens of thousands of people. Both tasks are possible, but only one is an efficient and productive use of resources and therefore the more feasible.",
		"If a carpenter only has a hammer and nails, then he will think about nailing things to whatever he is doing. If all he has is a saw, then he will think about ways of cutting pieces off of what he is doing. This was a great strategy back in the Paleolithic days, when we had limited tools. It helped us to figure out how to take a stick or a rock (the only tool we might have) and knock fruit out of a tree so we didn’t starve. Today, however, we have multiple tools at our disposal. Some of them are good and some are not so good. However, this way of thinking is still hard-wired in our brain. As a result, it can cause us to use the wrong tool. We tend to consider using only the tools we have easily available, the tools we have actually learned how to use, and how we can use them to get our work done.",
		"When commercial refrigeration became a possibility in the late nineteenth century, it offered great advantages, both to consumers and to industry. Fridges were especially useful for storing perishable substances such as milk, which had previously been the cause of thousands of deaths every year in the big cities of the world. Refrigeration benefited traders too, creating a longer window of opportunity in which they could sell their food. Yet there was a widespread terror of this new technology, from both buyers and sellers. Consumers were suspicious of food that had been kept in cold storage. Market traders, too, did not know how to think of this new chill. In the 1890s, some sellers in Paris felt that refrigeration would spoil their produce. And at some level, they were right, as anyone who has ever compared a tomato at room temperature with one from the fridge can confirm: one is sweetly fragrant and juicy; the other is metallic and dull. Every new technology includes both gain and loss.",
		"A classic positive­-sum game in economic life is the trading of surpluses. If a farmer has more grain than he can eat, and a herder has more milk than he can drink, both of them come out ahead if they trade some wheat for some milk. As they say, everybody wins. Of course, an exchange at a single moment in time only pays when there is a division of labor. There would be no point in one farmer giving a bushel of wheat to another farmer and receiving a bushel of wheat in return. A fundamental insight of modern economics is that the key to the creation of wealth is a division of labor, in which specialists learn to produce a commodity with increasing cost­-effectiveness and have the means to exchange their specialized products efficiently. One infrastructure that allows efficient exchange is transportation, which makes it possible for producers to trade their surpluses even when they are separated by distance. Another is money, interest, and middlemen, which allow producers to exchange many kinds of surpluses with many other producers at many points in time.",
		"Human movement can be affected, either positively or negatively, by the environment within which the movement takes place. Consider an athlete who runs the 100 m wearing training shoes. She is unlikely to achieve as good a time wearing these shoes as she would if she wore specifically designed spiked running shoes. During athletic competitions wind speed is always measured as it is recognised as having an impact, either positively or negatively, on performance times. If our runner was running into a headwind, her speed would be reduced, as some of her force would be needed to overcome the additional obstacle of the wind. On the contrary, if she had a tailwind her performance would be enhanced and movement assisted by the wind. Let us also consider other surrounding circumstances, such as what is motivating the athlete to run. Is she there because she really wants to be, or is she there just because her brother is also a runner and so her parents bring her along as well? Motivation is a key factor in sports training and performance.",
		"That ice can flow is contrary to everyday experience. An ice cube from the freezer placed on a table does not flow, it just sits there and melts. It is too small for flow to occur. An ice cube thousands of times larger would sag under its own weight and flow away as a glacier. Flow in ice is caused by gravity, the same force that makes the water of a river flow downhill. When gravity­-induced stress exceeds the force that holds the particles of water or ice together, the atoms and molecules slip past each other downslope. To exceed ice’s internal strength the downslope force produced by gravity must exceed some minimum value. This is why an ice cube cannot flow. But as size increases, gravity­-induced stress becomes greater while internal strength remains the same. Thus at some minimum thickness flow will begin in ice, or in any material for that matter.",
		"Imagine that you are dining with some people you have just met. You reach for the saltshaker, but suddenly one of the other guests, let’s call him Joe, looks at you sullenly, then snatches the salt away and puts it out of your reach. Later, when you are leaving the restaurant, Joe dashes ahead of you and blocks the exit door from the outside. Joe is being rude―when you understand what another person is trying to do, it is offensive, or at least confrontational, to prevent that person from doing it. However, if you were meeting the same people to play a board game, it would be completely acceptable for the same Joe to prevent you from winning the game. In the restaurant as well as in the game, Joe is aware of your intention, and Joe prevents you from doing what you are trying to do. At the restaurant, this is rude. In the game just mentioned, this is expected and acceptable behavior. Apparently, games give us a license to engage in conflicts, to prevent others from achieving their goals.",
		"Forget-me-nots can conquer new territory because they have an army of tiny allies: ants. It’s not that ants are particularly fond of flowers―at least, they are not attracted by their aesthetic qualities. Ants are motivated by their desire to eat them, and their interest is triggered when forget-me-nots form their seeds. The seeds are designed to make an ant’s mouth water, for attached to the outside is a structure called an elaiosome, which looks like a tiny bit of cake. This fat-and sugar-rich treat is like chips and chocolate to an ant. The tiny creatures quickly carry the seeds back to their nest, where the colony is waiting eagerly in the tunnels for the calorie boost. The tasty treat is bitten off and the seed itself is discarded. Along come the trash collectors in the form of worker ants, which dispose of the seeds in the neighborhood―carrying them up to 200 feet away from home base. Wild strawberries and other plants also benefit from this distribution service: ants are nature’s gardeners, as it were.",
		"Birds use many techniques to save energy when they are flying, most of which are tricks to stay aloft without flapping. Riding updrafts to gain altitude is one of the most conspicuous. Bare ground such as fields or parking lots absorbs more heat from the sun, and as air near the ground warms up it rises. This creates a column of rising warm air―a thermal― reaching hundreds or even thousands of feet high. A soaring bird can sense the air movement and fly in circles to stay in the column. It simply fans its wings and tail and lets the rising air carry it up like an elevator. When it reaches the top, the bird bends its wings and glides in the direction it wants to travel, searching for the next thermal. All soaring birds take advantage of thermals, but some species, like the Broad-winged Hawk, are specialists and in the right conditions can travel hundreds of miles with almost no flapping.",
		"Many people cannot understand what there is about birds to become obsessed about. What are bird­watchers actually doing out there in the woods, swamps, and fields? The key to comprehending the passion of birding is to realize that bird­watching is really a hunt. But unlike hunting, the trophies you accumulate are in your mind. Of course, your mind is a great place to populate with them because you carry them around with you wherever you go. You don’t leave them to gather dust on a wall or up in the attic. Your birding experiences become part of your life, part of who you are. And because birders are human, these birding memories ―like most human memories―improve over time. The colors of the plumages become richer, the songs sweeter, and those elusive field marks more vivid and distinct in retrospect.",
		"Distinct from the timing of interaction is the way in which time is compressed on television. Specifically, the pauses and delays that characterize everyday life are removed through editing, and new accents are added― namely, a laugh track. The familiar result is a compressed event in which action flows with rapid ease, compacting hours or even days into minutes, and minutes into seconds. Audiences are spared the waiting common to everyday life. Although this use of time may appear unnatural in the abstract, the television audience has come to expect it, and critics demand it. More important, television performers, or people who depend on television, such as politicians, are evaluated by viewers (voters) on their ability to meet time compression requirements, such as the one sentence graphic statement or metaphor to capture the moment. It is the statement that is in bold print or the boxed insert in newspaper and magazine articles. As such, compression techniques accentuate another important temporal dimension of television―rhythm and tempo.",
		"Most of us have a general, rational sense of what to eat and when―there is no shortage of information on the subject. Yet there is often a disconnect between what we know and what we do. We may have the facts, but decisions also involve our feelings. Many people who struggle with difficult emotions also struggle with eating problems. Emotional eating is a popular term used to describe eating that is influenced by emotions, both positive and negative. Feelings may affect various aspects of your eating, including your motivation to eat, your food choices, where and with whom you eat, and the speed at which you eat. Most overeating is prompted by feelings rather than physical hunger. Individuals who struggle with obesity tend to eat in response to emotions. However, people who eat for emotional reasons are not necessarily overweight. People of any size may try to escape an emotional experience by preoccupying themselves with eating or by obsessing over their shape and weight.",
		"Ever since the first scientific opinion polls revealed that most Americans are at best poorly informed about politics, analysts have asked whether citizens are equipped to play the role democracy assigns them. However, there is something worse than an inadequately informed public, and that’s a misinformed public. It’s one thing when citizens don’t know something, and realize it, which has always been a problem. It’s another thing when citizens don’t know something, but think they know it, which is the new problem. It’s the difference between ignorance and irrationality. Whatever else one might conclude about self-government, it’s at risk when citizens don’t know what they’re talking about. Our misinformation owes partly to psychological factors, including our tendency to see the world in ways that suit our desires. Such factors, however, can explain only the misinformation that has always been with us. The sharp rise in misinformation in recent years has a different source: our media. “They are making us dumb,” says one observer. When fact bends to fiction, the predictable result is political distrust and polarization.",
		"Film speaks in a language of the senses. Its flowing and sparkling stream of images, its compelling pace and natural rhythms, and its pictorial style are all part of this nonverbal language. So it follows naturally that the aesthetic quality and dramatic power of the image are extremely important to the overall quality of a film. Although the nature and quality of the story, editing, musical score, sound effects, dialogue, and acting can do much to enhance a film’s power, even these important elements cannot save a film whose images are mediocre or poorly edited. As important as the quality of the image may be, however, it must not be considered so important that the purpose of the film as an artistic, unified whole is ignored. A film’s photographic effects should not be created for their own sake as independent, beautiful, or powerful images. In the final analysis, they must be justified psychologically and dramatically, as well as aesthetically, as important means to an end, not as ends in themselves. Creating beautiful images for the sake of creating beautiful images violates a film’s aesthetic unity and may actually work against the film.",
		"When dealing with investments, different people have different risk profiles. If risk is a continuum from high risk to low risk, a retired investor will generally take less risk than a young investor just entering the market. Why is this? Why are younger investors generally willing to take more risks than older investors? It is not because younger people don’t care or tend to make hazardous decisions, although that may be true to some extent. No, younger investors tend to take more risk with their investments because they have a longer time horizon on when they expect to actually need their money. For the vast majority of people, the reason they invest is so they can enjoy retirement. This means that younger people are not expecting to sell their investments for twenty or thirty years. With this kind of time horizon, they can afford to shoot for the higher risk, higher return investments. For them, the prospect of losing money is not that bad. If they lose, they still have time to make it up.",
		"Regression fallacy is a mistake of causal reasoning due to the failure to consider how things fluctuate randomly, typically around some average condition. Intense pain, exceptional sports performance, and high stock prices are likely to be followed by more subdued conditions eventually due to natural fluctuation. Failure to recognize this fact can lead to wrong conclusions about causation. For example, someone might suffer from back pain now and then but nothing seems to solve the problem completely. During a period of very intense pain, the patient decided to try alternative therapy like putting a magnetic patch on his back. He felt less pain afterward and concluded that the patch worked. But this could just be the result of regression. If he sought treatment when the pain was very intense, it is quite possible that the pain has already reached its peak and would lessen in any case as part of the natural cycle. Inferring that the patch was effective ignored a relevant alternative explanation.",
		"There was a moment in research history when scientists wondered if the measure of choice―total minutes of sleep―was the wrong way of looking at the question of why sleep varies so considerably across species. Instead, they suspected that assessing sleep quality, rather than quantity (time), would shed some light on the mystery. That is, species with superior quality of sleep should be able to accomplish all they need in a shorter time, and vice versa. It was a great idea, with the exception that, if anything, we’ve discovered the opposite relationship: those that sleep more have deeper, “higher”­quality sleep. In truth, the way quality is commonly assessed in these investigations (degree of unresponsiveness to the outside world and the continuity of sleep) is probably a poor index of the real biological measure of sleep quality: one that we cannot yet obtain in all these species. When we can, our understanding of the relationship between sleep quantity and quality across the animal kingdom will likely explain what currently appears to be an incomprehensible map of sleep­-time differences.",
		"Notation was more than a practical method for preserving an expanding repertoire of music. It changed the nature of the art itself. To write something down means that people far away in space and time can re-create it. At the same time, there are downsides. Written notes freeze the music rather than allowing it to develop in the hands of individuals, and it discourages improvisation. Partly because of notation, modern classical performance lacks the depth of nuance that is part of aural tradition. Before notation arrived, in all history music was largely carried on as an aural tradition. Most world music is still basically aural, including sophisticated musical traditions such as Indian and Balinese. Most jazz musicians can read music but often don’t bother, and their art is much involved with improvisation. Many modern pop musicians, one example being Paul McCartney, can’t read music at all.",
		"Marshall McLuhan, among others, noted that clothes are people’s extended skin, wheels extended feet, camera and telescopes extended eyes. Our technological creations are great extrapolations of the bodies that our genes build. In this way, we can think of technology as our extended body. During the industrial age it was easy to see the world this way. Steam-powered shovels, locomotives, television, and the levers and gears of engineers were a fabulous exoskeleton that turned man into superman. A closer look reveals the flaw in this analogy: The extended costume of animals is the result of their genes. They inherit the basic blueprints of what they make. Humans don’t. The blueprints for our shells spring from our minds, which may spontaneously create something none of our ancestors ever made or even imagined. If technology is an extension of humans, it is not an extension of our genes but of our minds. Technology is therefore the extended body for ideas.",
		"The reason why any sugar molecule―whether in cocoa bean or pan or anywhere else―turns brown when heated is to do with the presence of carbon. Sugars are carbohydrates, which is to say that they are made of carbon (“carbo­”), hydrogen (“hydr­”), and oxygen (“­ate”) atoms. When heated, these long molecules disintegrate into smaller units, some of which are so small that they evaporate (which accounts for the lovely smell). On the whole, it is the carbon­-rich molecules that are larger, so these get left behind, and within these there is a structure called a carbon­-carbon double bond. This chemical structure absorbs light. In small amounts it gives the caramelizing sugar a yellow­-brown color. Further roasting will turn some of the sugar into pure carbon (double bonds all round), which creates a burnt flavor and a dark­-brown color. Complete roasting results in charcoal: all of the sugar has become carbon, which is black.",
		"In the 1980s and ’90s, some conservationists predicted that orangutans would go extinct in the wild within 20 or 30 years. Fortunately that didn’t happen. Many thousands more orangutans are now known to exist than were recognized at the turn of the millennium. This doesn’t mean that all is well in the orangutans’ world. The higher figures come thanks to improved survey methods and the discovery of previously unknown populations, not because the actual numbers have increased. In fact, the overall population of orangutans has fallen by at least 80 percent in the past 75 years. It’s indicative of the difficulty of orangutan research that scientist Erik Meijaard is willing to say only that between 40,000 and 100,000 live on Borneo. Conservationists on Sumatra estimate that only 14,000 survive there. Much of this loss has been driven by habitat destruction from logging and the rapid spread of vast plantations of oil palm, the fruit of which is sold to make oil used in cooking and in many food products.",
		"A carbon sink is a natural feature that absorbs or stores more carbon than it releases. The value of carbon sinks is that they can help create equilibrium in the atmosphere by removing excess CO2. One example of a carbon sink is a large forest. Its mass of plants and other organic material absorb and store tons of carbon. However, the planet’s major carbon sink is its oceans. Since the Industrial Revolution began in the eighteenth century, CO2 released during industrial processes has greatly increased the proportion of carbon in the atmosphere. Carbon sinks have been able to absorb about half of this excess CO2, and the world’s oceans have done the major part of that job. They absorb about one-fourth of humans’ industrial carbon emissions, doing half the work of all Earth’s carbon sinks combined.",
		"Promoting attractive images of one’s country is not new, but the conditions for trying to create soft power have changed dramatically in recent years. For one thing, nearly half the countries in the world are now democracies. In such circumstances, diplomacy aimed at public opinion can become as important to outcomes as traditional classified diplomatic communications among leaders. Information creates power, and today a much larger part of the world’s population has access to that power. Technological advances have led to a dramatic reduction in the cost of processing and transmitting information. The result is an explosion of information, and that has produced a “paradox of plenty.” Plentiful information leads to scarcity of attention. When people are overwhelmed with the volume of information confronting them, they have difficulty knowing what to focus on. Attention, rather than information, becomes the scarce resource, and those who can distinguish valuable information from background clutter gain power.",
		"A sovereign state is usually defined as one whose citizens are free to determine their own affairs without interference from any agency beyond its territorial borders. But freedom in space (and limits on its territorial extent) is merely one characteristic of sovereignty. Freedom in time (and limits on its temporal extent) is equally important and probably more fundamental. Sovereignty and citizenship require freedom from the past at least as much as freedom from contemporary powers. No state could be sovereign if its inhabitants lacked the ability to change a course of action adopted by their forefathers in the past, or even one to which they once committed themselves. No citizen could be a full member of the community so long as she was tied to ancestral traditions with which the community might wish to break―the problem of Antigone in Sophocles’ tragedy. Sovereignty and citizenship thus require not only borders in space, but also borders in time.",
		"Because a main goal of science is to discover lawful relationships, science assumes that what is being investigated is lawful. For example, the chemist assumes that chemical reactions are lawful, and the physicist assumes that the physical world is lawful. The assumption that what is being studied can be understood in terms of causal laws is called determinism. Richard Taylor defined determinism as the philosophical doctrine that “states that for everything that ever happens there are conditions such that, given them, nothing else could happen.” The determinist, then, assumes that everything that occurs is a function of a finite number of causes and that, if these causes were known, an event could be predicted with complete accuracy. However, knowing all causes of an event is not necessary; the determinist simply assumes that they exist and that as more causes are known, predictions become more accurate. For example, almost everyone would agree that the weather is a function of a finite number of variables such as sunspots, high-altitude jet streams, and barometric pressure; yet weather forecasts are always probabilistic because many of these variables change constantly, and others are simply unknown.",
		"Studies of people struggling with major health problems show that the majority of respondents report they derived benefits from their adversity. Stressful events sometimes force people to develop new skills, reevaluate priorities, learn new insights, and acquire new strengths. In other words, the adaptation process initiated by stress can lead to personal changes for the better. One study that measured participants’ exposure to thirty-seven major negative events found a curvilinear relationship between lifetime adversity and mental health. High levels of adversity predicted poor mental health, as expected, but people who had faced intermediate levels of adversity were healthier than those who experienced little adversity, suggesting that moderate amounts of stress can foster resilience. A follow-up study found a similar link between the amount of lifetime adversity and subjects’ responses to laboratory stressors. Intermediate levels of adversity were predictive of the greatest resilience. Thus, having to deal with a moderate amount of stress may build resilience in the face of future stress.",
		"The fruit ripening process brings about the softening of cell walls, sweetening and the production of chemicals that give colour and flavour. The process is induced by the production of a plant hormone called ethylene. (C) The problem for growers and retailers is that ripening is followed sometimes quite rapidly by deterioration and decay and the product becomes worthless. Tomatoes and other fruits are, therefore, usually picked and transported when they are unripe. In some countries they are then sprayed with ethylene before sale to the consumer to induce ripening. However, fruit picked before it is ripe has less flavour than fruit picked ripe from the plant. Biotechnologists therefore saw an opportunity in delaying the ripening and softening process in fruit. If ripening could be slowed down by interfering with ethylene production or with the processes that respond to ethylene, fruit could be left on the plant until it was ripe and full of flavour but would still be in good condition when it arrived at the supermarket shelf.",
		"In the fifth century B.C.E., the Greek philosopher Protagoras pronounced, “Man is the measure of all things.” In other words, we feel entitled to ask the world, “What good are you?” We assume that we are the world’s standard, that all things should be compared to us. Such an assumption makes us overlook a lot. Abilities said to “make us human”―empathy, communication, grief, toolmaking, and so on―all exist to varying degrees among other minds sharing the world with us. Animals with backbones (fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) all share the same basic skeleton, organs, nervous systems, hormones, and behaviors. Just as different models of automobiles each have an engine, drive train, four wheels, doors, and seats, we differ mainly in terms of our outside contours and a few internal tweaks. But like naive car buyers, most people see only animals’ varied exteriors.",
		"It can be difficult to decide the place of fine art, such as oil paintings, water-colours, sketches or sculptures, in an archival institution. Art can serve as documentary evidence, especially when the items were produced before photography became common. Sketches of soldiers on a battlefield, paintings of English country villages or portraits of Dutch townspeople can provide the only visual evidence of a long-ago place, person or time. But art can also carry aesthetic value, which elevates the job of evaluation into another realm. Aesthetic value and the notion of artistic beauty are important considerations, but they are not what motivates archival preservation in the first instance. The best archival decisions about art do not focus on territoriality (this object belongs in my institution even though I do not have the resources to care for it) or on questions of monetary value or prestige (this object raises the cultural standing of my institution). The best decisions focus on what evidential value exists and what is best for the item.",
		"Spatial reference points are larger than themselves. This isn’t really a paradox: landmarks are themselves, but they also define neighborhoods around themselves. In a paradigm that has been repeated on many campuses, researchers first collect a list of campus landmarks from students. Then they ask another group of students to estimate the distances between pairs of locations, some to landmarks, some to ordinary buildings on campus. The remarkable finding is that distances from an ordinary location to a landmark are judged shorter than distances from a landmark to an ordinary location. So, people would judge the distance from Pierre’s house to the Eiffel Tower to be shorter than the distance from the Eiffel Tower to Pierre’s house. Like black holes, landmarks seem to pull ordinary locations toward themselves, but ordinary places do not. This asymmetry of distance estimates violates the most elementary principles of Euclidean distance, that the distance from A to B must be the same as the distance from B to A. Judgments of distance, then, are not necessarily coherent.",
		"A firm is deciding whether to invest in shipbuilding. If it can produce at sufficiently large scale, it knows the venture will be profitable. But one key input is low-cost steel, and it must be produced nearby. The company’s decision boils down to this: if there is a steel factory close by, invest in shipbuilding; otherwise, don’t invest. Now consider the thinking of potential steel investors in the region. Assume that shipyards are the only potential customers of steel. Steel producers figure they’ll make money if there’s a shipyard to buy their steel, but not otherwise. Now we have two possible outcomes―what economists call “multiple equilibria.” There is a “good” outcome, in which both types of investments are made, and both the shipyard and the steelmakers end up profitable and happy. Equilibrium is reached. Then there is a “bad” outcome, in which neither type of investment is made. This second outcome also is an equilibrium because the decisions not to invest reinforce each other.",
		"In a process called seeding, you need to have a time frame in mind. Start telling your family how you feel about your current job. Tell them how you get frustrated and bored with this job. Discuss this almost twice a week. Then start doing work related to your passion on the side and let them see and experience how happy you are while doing this. Find a way to get your family and friends involved in your passion. The more they see you doing your passion, the more they connect with you emotionally. Tell them stories of how you are inspired by the passion and how it makes a difference not only to you but also to others. Give examples of how someone living a similar passion started his or her life and today how he or she is living happily. These stories will make them realise that you are meant to follow your passion. At times they need to be surprised with your small achievements, which could be some additional skills you acquired, or some awards you won in your field of passion.",
		"Living in dispersal correlates with a shocking retreat from public life, according to extensive analysis of the Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey of nearly thirty thousand people begun in 2000. It is hard to pinpoint the origin of this retreat. It may be because people in the dispersed city have invested so heavily in private comfort that they feel insulated from the problems of the rest of the world. It may be that sprawl has attracted people who are naturally less interested in engaging with the world, socially or politically. These are both possible, but evidence suggests that the spatial landscape matters. Sociologists point out that the suburbs have done an efficient job of sorting people into communities where they will be surrounded by people of the same socioeconomic status. Meanwhile, the architectures of sprawl inhibit political activity that requires face­-to­-face interaction. It is not that sprawl makes political activity impossible, but by privatizing gathering space and dispersing human activity, sprawl makes political gathering less likely.",
		"Anger and empathy—like matter and antimatter—can’t exist in the same place at the same time. Let one in, and you have to let the other one go. So when you shift a blamer into empathy, you stop the person’s angry ranting dead in its tracks. And what about the person who’s on the defensive? Initially, this human punching bag is frustrated because no matter what he or she is trying to mirror outward the ignorant blamer is blind to it. As a result, the person who’s under attack is usually in a state of quiet, barely controlled rage. Suddenly and unexpectedly, however, the blamer knows just how sad, angry, scared, or lonely the defender feels and spontaneously turns into an ally. When the defender feels understood by the blamer and that they are on the same side, there’s nothing to defend against. The defender’s wall, and with it his unspoken rage and frustration, disappears. The relief from no longer feeling “fear or hatred” toward the blamer spontaneously triggers a tremendous rush of gratitude and—miraculously—the person’s quiet rage turns into forgiveness and, beyond that, a willingness to work toward solutions.",
		"When a young child sees clouds moving across the sky, the clouds may seem alive and independent, perhaps dangerous. But if one sees clouds as fleecy lambs, a metaphorical chain begins to neutralize the fear. The cloud may still be thought of as alive, but it is no longer terrifying. Repression and neutralization through metaphor are possible strategies, but there is another. Faced with the moving clouds, the child can theorize about their movement in such a way that the clouds cease to be alive. “Cloud movement” becomes differentiated from the kind of movement that makes things alive, because the clouds move only if they are “pushed” by the wind, and what can’t move without a push from the outside is not alive. Children develop theoretical constructs that separate the motion of clouds from the motion of people and animals so that eventually the fear of living clouds disappears. If things seem uncomfortably on the border between the alive and the not‑alive, use logic to redefine the boundaries so that things fall more comfortably into place. If it scares you, make a theory.",
		"Green products involve, in many cases, higher ingredient costs than those of mainstream products. Furthermore, the restrictive ingredient lists and design criteria that are typical of such products may make green products inferior to mainstream products on core performance dimensions (e.g., less effective cleansers). In turn, the higher costs and lower performance of some products attract only a small portion of the customer base, leading to lower economies of scale in procurement, manufacturing, and distribution. Even if the green product succeeds, it may cannibalize the company’s higher-profit mainstream offerings. Given such downsides, companies serving mainstream consumers with successful mainstream products face what seems like an obvious investment decision. They’d rather put money and time into known, profitable, high-volume products that serve populous customer segments than into risky, less-profitable, low-volume products that may serve current non-customers. Given that choice, these companies may choose to leave the green segment of the market to small niche competitors.",
		"Recently, a number of commercial ventures have been launched that offer social robots as personal home assistants, perhaps eventually to rival existing smart-home assistants. Personal robotic assistants are devices that have no physical manipulation or locomotion capabilities. Instead, they have a distinct social presence and have visual features suggestive of their ability to interact socially, such as eyes, ears, or a mouth. They might be motorized and can track the user around the room, giving the impression of being aware of the people in the environment. Although personal robotic assistants provide services similar to those of smart-home assistants, their social presence offers an opportunity that is unique to social robots. For instance, in addition to playing music, a social personal assistant robot would express its engagement with the music so that users would feel like they are listening to the music together with the robot. These robots can be used as surveillance devices, act as communicative intermediates, engage in richer games, tell stories, or be used to provide encouragement or incentives.",
		"What are some characteristics of cities that must be maintained even if the population decreases? If this question can be answered, a new city model can be proposed based on the concept. Here, we focus on productivity and diversity as characteristics of cities. This is because ensuring productivity and diversity is the driving force for sustainability. For example, if there is a place to work, people gather and work there, and the population gradually accumulates to form a city. However, the industrial structure that depends on a single industry is vulnerable to social changes. Given that gold mining cities and coal mining cities have risen and fallen, their vulnerability is obvious. A city where various people gather in various industries is secure against social changes. The same is true in the natural world, and the importance of biodiversity is essential for the sustainability of the species. The same is true in cities. In a society where people of all ages and income levels live together, and diverse industries coexist while depending on each other, cities will continue to exist overcoming environmental changes such as population decline.",
		"Both ancient farmers and foragers suffered seasonal food shortages. During these periods children and adults alike would go to bed hungry some days and everyone would lose fat and muscle. But over longer periods of time farming societies were far more likely to suffer severe, existentially threatening famines than foragers. Foraging may be much less productive and generate far lower energy yields than farming but it is also much less risky. This is firstly because foragers tended to live well within the natural limits imposed by their environments, and secondly because where farmers typically relied on one or two staple crops, foragers in even the harshest environments relied on dozens of different food sources and so were usually able to adjust their diets to align with an ecosystem’s own dynamic responses to changing conditions. Typically, in complex ecosystems when weather one year proves unsuitable for one set of plant species, it almost inevitably suits others. But in farming societies when harvests fail as a result of, for example, a sustained drought, then catastrophe emerges.",
		"The fossil record provides evidence of evolution. The story the fossils tell is one of change. Creatures existed in the past that are no longer with us. Sequential changes are found in many fossils showing the change of certain features over time from a common ancestor, as in the case of the horse. Apart from demonstrating that evolution did occur, the fossil record also provides tests of the predictions made from evolutionary theory. For example, the theory predicts that single-celled organisms evolved before multi-celled organisms. The fossil record supports this prediction―multi-celled organisms are found in layers of earth millions of years after the first appearance of single-celled organisms. Note that the possibility always remains that the opposite could be found. If multi-celled organisms were indeed found to have evolved before single-celled organisms, then the theory of evolution would be rejected. A good scientific theory always allows for the possibility of rejection. The fact that we have not found such a case in countless examinations of the fossil record strengthens the case for evolutionary theory.",
		"In economics, there is a principle known as the sunk cost fallacy. The idea is that when you are invested and have ownership in something, you overvalue that thing. This leads people to continue on paths or pursuits that should clearly be abandoned. For example, people often remain in terrible relationships simply because they’ve invested a great deal of themselves into them. Or someone may continue pouring money into a business that is clearly a bad idea in the market. Sometimes, the smartest thing a person can do is quit. Although this is true, it has also become a tired and played-out argument. Sunk cost doesn’t always have to be a bad thing. Actually, you can leverage this human tendency to your benefit. Like someone invests a great deal of money in a personal trainer to ensure they follow through on their commitment, you, too, can invest a great deal up front to ensure you stay on the path you want to be on.",
		"It raises much less reactance to tell people what to do than to tell them what not to do. Therefore, advocating action should lead to higher compliance than prohibiting action. For example, researchers have a choice of how to debrief research participants in an experiment involving some deception or omission of information. Often researchers attempt to commit the participant to silence, saying “Please don’t tell other potential participants that feedback from the other person was false.” This is a prescription that is rife with danger, failing to provide an implementation rule and raising reactance. Much better is to say, “To help make sure that other people provide answers as useful as yours have been, when people ask you about this study, please tell them that you and another person answered some questions about each other.” Similarly, I once saw a delightful and unusual example of this principle at work in an art gallery. A fragile acrylic sculpture had a sign at the base saying, “Please touch with your eyes.” The command was clear, yet created much less reactance in me than “Don’t touch!” would have.",
		"One common strategy and use of passive misdirection in the digital world comes through the use of repetition. This digital misdirection strategy relies on the fact that online users utilizing web browsers to visit websites have quickly learned that the most basic ubiquitous navigational action is to click on a link or button presented to them on a website. This action is repeated over and over to navigate their web browsers to the desired web page or action until it becomes an almost immediate, reflexive action. Malicious online actors take advantage of this behavior to distract the user from carefully examining the details of the web page that might tip off the user that there is something amiss about the website. The website is designed to focus the user’s attention on the action the malicious actor wants them to take (e.g., click a link) and to draw their attention away from any details that might suggest to the user that the website is not what it appears to be on the surface.",
		"Humans are unique in the realm of living beings in knowing there is a future. If people experience worry and hope, it is because they realize the future exists, that it can be better or worse, and that the outcome depends to some extent on them. But having this knowledge does not imply that they know what to do with it. People often repress their awareness of the future because thinking about it distorts the comfort of the now, which tends to be more powerful than the future because it is present and because it is certain. The future, on the other hand, must be imagined in advance and, for that very reason, is always uncertain. Getting along with the future is not an easy task, nor is it one in which instinct prevents us from blunders. That is why we so often have a poor relationship with the future and are either more fearful than we need to be or allow ourselves to hope against all evidence; we worry excessively or not enough; we fail to predict the future or to shape it as much as we are able.",
		"Bipedalism, upright walking, started a chain of enormous evolutionary adjustments. It liberated hominin arms for carrying weapons and for taking food to group sites instead of consuming it on the spot. But bipedalism was necessary to trigger hand dexterity and tool use. Hashimoto and co‑workers concluded that adaptations underlying tool use evolved independently of those required for human bipedalism because in both humans and monkeys, each finger is represented separately in the primary sensorimotor cortex, just as the fingers are physically separated in the hand. This creates the ability to use each digit independently in the complex manipulations required for tool use. But without bipedalism it would be impossible to use the trunk for leverage in accelerating the hand during toolmaking and tool use. Bipedalism also freed the mouth and teeth to develop a more complex call system as the prerequisite of language. These developments required larger brains whose energy cost eventually reached three times the level for chimpanzees, accounting for up to one‑sixth of the total basal metabolic rate.",
		"Aristotle explains that the Good for human beings consists in eudaimoniā (a Greek word combining eu meaning “good” with daimon meaning “spirit,” and most often translated as “happiness”). Whereas he had argued in a purely formal way that the Good was that to which we all aim, he now gives a more substantive answer: that this universal human goal is happiness. However, he is quick to point out that this conclusion is still somewhat formal since different people have different views about what happiness is. Some people say it is worldly enjoyment while others say it is eternal salvation. Aristotle’s theory will turn out to be “naturalistic” in that it does not depend on any theological or metaphysical knowledge. It does not depend on knowledge of God or of metaphysical and universal moral norms. It depends only on knowledge of human nature and other worldly and social realities. For him it is the study of human nature and worldly existence that will disclose the relevant meaning of the notion of eudaimoniā.",
		"A large body of research in decision science has indicated that one attribute that is regularly substituted for an explicit assessment of decision costs and benefits is an affective valuation of the prospect at hand. This is often a very rational attribute to substitute— affect does convey useful signals as to the costs and benefits of outcomes. A problem sometimes arises, however, when affective valuation is not supplemented by any analytic processing and adjustment at all. For example, sole reliance on affective valuation can make people insensitive to probabilities and to quantitative features of the outcome that should effect decisions. One study demonstrated that people’s evaluation of a situation where they might receive a shock is insensitive to the probability of receiving the shock because their thinking is swamped by affective evaluation of the situation. People were willing to pay almost as much to avoid a 1 percent probability of receiving a shock as they were to pay to avoid a 99 percent probability of receiving a shock. Clearly the affective reaction to the thought of receiving a shock was overwhelming the subjects’ ability to evaluate the probabilities associated.",
		"When two natural bodies of water stand at different levels, building a canal between them presents a complicated engineering problem. To make up for the difference in level, engineers build one or more water “steps,” called locks, that carry ships or boats up or down between the two levels. A lock is an artificial water basin. It has a long rectangular shape with concrete walls and a pair of gates at each end. When a vessel is going upstream, the upper gates stay closed as the ship enters the lock at the lower water level. The downstream gates are then closed and more water is pumped into the basin. The rising water lifts the vessel to the level of the upper body of water. Then the upper gates open and the ship passes through. For downstream passage, the process works the opposite way. The ship enters the lock from the upper level, and water is pumped from the lock until the ship is in line with the lower level.",
		"Culture operates in ways we can consciously consider and discuss but also in ways of which we are far less cognizant. When we have to offer an account of our actions, we consciously understand which excuses might prove acceptable, given the particular circumstances we find ourselves in. In such situations, we use cultural ideas as we would use a particular tool. We select the cultural notion as we would select a screwdriver: certain jobs call for a Phillips head while others require an Allen wrench. Whichever idea we insert into the conversation to justify our actions, the point is that our motives are discursively available to us. They are not hidden. In some cases, however, we are far less aware of why we believe a certain claim to be true, or how we are to explain why certain social realities exist. Ideas about the social world become part of our worldview without our necessarily being aware of the source of the particular idea or that we even hold the idea at all.",
		"The Earth formed from rocky and metallic fragments during the construction of the solar system―debris that was swept up by an initial nucleus and attracted together into a single body by the force of gravity. The original materials were cold as outer space and dry as dust; whatever water and gases they contained were locked inside individual fragments as chemical compounds. As the fragments joined, the Earth’s gravity increased, attracting larger and larger objects to impact the Earth. This increasing gravity, combined with the timeless radioactive decay of elements like uranium and thorium, caused the new Earth to heat up. The internal temperature and pressure were high enough for many compounds to break down or melt, releasing their water and gases. Even solid material could begin to move and flow under such conditions. Separation by density began, and the Earth started to organize into its present layered structure. The heaviest metals sank to the center; the lightest materials migrated outward.",
		"Representation is control. The power to represent the world is the power to represent us in it or it in us, for the final stage of representing merges the representor and the represented into one. Imperializing cultures produce great works of art (great representations) which can be put to work intellectually as armies and trading houses work militarily and economically. Shakespeare, Jane Austen and maps were as important to English Imperial power as was the East India Company, the British army and the churches of England. It is no coincidence that modern Europe, the Europe of colonization, was also the Europe of “great art,” and no coincidence either that it was the Europe of great map makers. That is because unless we can control the world intellectually by maps we cannot control it militarily or economically. Mercator, Molière, Columbus and Captain Cook imperialized in different ways, but they all imperialized, and ultimately the effectiveness of one depended upon and supported the effectiveness of all the others. Similarly the US form of contemporary colonization, which involves occupying economies and political parties rather than physical territories, is accompanied by the power of both Hollywood and the satellite to represent the world to and for the US.",
		"The growing complexity of computer software has direct implications for our global safety and security, particularly as the physical objects upon which we depend―things like cars, airplanes, bridges, tunnels, and implantable medical devices―transform themselves into computer code. (C) Physical things are increasingly becoming information technologies. Cars are “computers we ride in,” and airplanes are nothing more than “flying Solaris boxes attached to bucketfuls of industrial control systems.” (A) As all this code grows in size and complexity, so too do the number of errors and software bugs. According to a study by Carnegie Mellon University, commercial software typically has twenty to thirty bugs for every thousand lines of code―50 million lines of code means 1 million to 1.5 million potential errors to be exploited. (B) This is the basis for all malware attacks that take advantage of these computer bugs to get the code to do something it was not originally intended to do. As computer code grows more elaborate, software bugs flourish and security suffers, with increasing consequences for society at large.",
		"Darwin saw blushing as uniquely human, representing an involuntary physical reaction caused by embarrassment and self-consciousness in a social environment. If we feel awkward, embarrassed or ashamed when we are alone, we don’t blush; it seems to be caused by our concern about what others are thinking of us. Studies have confirmed that simply being told you are blushing brings it on. We feel as though others can see through our skin and into our mind. However, while we sometimes want to disappear when we involuntarily go bright red, psychologists argue that blushing actually serves a positive social purpose. When we blush, it’s a signal to others that we recognize that a social norm has been broken; it is an apology for a faux pas. Maybe our brief loss of face benefits the long-term cohesion of the group. Interestingly, if someone blushes after making a social mistake, they are viewed in a more favourable light than those who don’t blush.",
		"The desire to see and interact with animals, shaped as it is by popular culture, can be a motivating factor for travel, but negative perceptions of certain animals can perform an entirely opposite role in discouraging people from visiting some destinations. The harmful effects of animals on tourism experiences has been the subject of analysis in a small number of studies, but deaths or injuries caused by animals to tourists are tiny in comparison to other causes such as drowning and vehicular accidents. Nevertheless, the possibility that they might encounter a dangerous animal such as shark or snake or catch a disease such as malaria is sufficient to stop at least some tourists from visiting destinations where such threats exist. Sometimes this fear is turned into a marketing opportunity. For example, there are a variety of t­-shirt and tea towel designs which celebrate the dangerous animals that can be encountered in Australia. This is a whimsical reconfiguration of the perceived threat that these animals pose to some tourists considering travel to this country.",
		"In the course of acquiring a language, children are exposed to only a finite set of utterances. Yet they come to use and understand an infinite set of sentences. This has been referred to as the creative aspect of language use. This ‘creativity’ does not refer to the ability to write poetry or novels but rather the ability to produce and understand an unlimited set of new sentences never spoken or heard previously. The precise linguistic input children receive differs from child to child; no two children are exposed to exactly the same set of utterances. Yet, they all arrive at pretty much the same grammar. The input that children get is haphazard in the sense that caretakers do not talk to their children to illustrate a particular point of grammar. Yet, all children develop systematic knowledge of a language. Thus, despite the severe limitations and variation in the input children receive, and also in their personal circumstances, they all develop a rich and uniform system of linguistic knowledge. The knowledge attained goes beyond the input in various ways.",
		"Twins provide a unique opportunity to study genes. Some pairs of twins are identical: they share the exact same genes in their DNA. Other pairs are fraternal, sharing only half of their genes on average. Differences in genetic similarity turn out to be a powerful natural experiment, allowing us to estimate how much genes influence a given trait. For example, identical twins almost always have the same eye color, but fraternal twins often do not. This suggests that genes play a role in eye color, and in fact geneticists have identified several specific genes that are involved. In the same way, scientists can estimate the role genes play in any other trait by comparing the similarity of identical twins to the similarity of fraternal twins. If there is a difference, then the magnitude of the difference gives a clue as to how much genes are involved.",
		"Shakespeare wrote, “What’s in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.” According to Stanford University psychology professor Lera Boroditsky, that’s not necessarily so. Focusing on the grammatical gender differences between German and Spanish, Boroditsky’s work indicates that the gender our language assigns to a given noun influences us to subconsciously give that noun characteristics of the grammatical gender. Take the word bridge. In German, bridge (die brücke) is a feminine noun; in Spanish, bridge (el puente) is a masculine noun. Boroditsky found that when asked to describe a bridge, native German speakers used words like beautiful, elegant, slender. When native Spanish speakers were asked the same question, they used words like strong, sturdy, towering. This worked the other way around as well. The word key is masculine in German and feminine in Spanish. When asked to describe a key, native German speakers used words like jagged, heavy, hard, metal. Spanish speakers used words like intricate, golden, lovely.",
		"For years business leaders and politicians have portrayed environmental protection and jobs as mutually exclusive. Pollution control, protection of natural areas and endangered species, and limits on use of nonrenewable resources, they claim, will choke the economy and throw people out of work. Ecological economists dispute this claim, however. Their studies show that only 0.1 percent of all large-scale layoffs in the United States in recent years were due to government regulations. Environmental protection, they argue, not only is necessary for a healthy economic system, but it actually creates jobs and stimulates business. Recycling, for instance, makes more new jobs than extracting raw materials. This doesn’t necessarily mean that recycled goods are more expensive than those from raw resources. We’re simply substituting labor in the recycling center for energy and huge machines used to extract new materials in remote places.",
		"Our perception always involves some imagination. It is more similar to painting than to photography. And, according to the confirmation effect, we blindly trust the reality we construct. This is best witnessed in visual illusions, which we perceive with full confidence, as if there were no doubt that we are portraying reality faithfully. One interesting way of discovering this—in a simple game that can be played at any moment—is the following. Whenever you are with another person, ask him or her to close their eyes, and start asking questions about what is nearby—not very particular details but the most striking elements of the scene. What is the color of the wall? Is there a table in the room? Does that man have a beard? You will see that the majority of us are quite ignorant about what lies around us. This is not so puzzling. The most extraordinary fact is that we completely disregard this ignorance.",
		"James Francis was born in England and emigrated to the United States at age 18. One of his first contributions to water engineering was the invention of the sprinkler system now widely used in buildings for fire protection. Francis’s design involved a series of perforated pipes running throughout the building. It had two defects: it had to be turned on manually, and it had only one valve. Once the system was activated by opening the valve, water would flow out everywhere. If the building did not burn down, it would certainly be completely flooded. Only some years later, when other engineers perfected the kind of sprinkler heads in use nowadays, did the concept become popular. They turned on automatically and were activated only where actually needed.",
		"The difference between selling and marketing is very simple. Selling focuses mainly on the firm’s desire to sell products for revenue. Salespeople and other forms of promotion are used to create demand for a firm’s current products. Clearly, the needs of the seller are very strong. Marketing, however, focuses on the needs of the consumer, ultimately benefiting the seller as well. When a product or service is truly marketed, the needs of the consumer are considered from the very beginning of the new product development process, and the product­-service mix is designed to meet the unsatisfied needs of the consuming public. When a product or service is marketed in the proper manner, very little selling is necessary because the consumer need already exists and the product or service is merely being produced to satisfy the need.",
		"Suppose that the price of frozen yogurt falls. The law of demand says that you will buy more frozen yogurt. At the same time, you will probably buy less ice cream. This is because ice cream and frozen yogurt are both cold and sweet desserts, satisfying similar desires. When a fall in the price of one good reduces the demand for another good, the two goods are called substitutes. They are often pairs of goods that are used in place of each other, like hot dogs and hamburgers. Now suppose that the price of chocolate topping falls. According to the law of demand, you will buy more chocolate topping. Yet, in this case, you will likely buy more ice cream as well, since ice cream and topping are often used together. When a fall in the price of one good raises the demand for another good, the two goods are called complements. ",
		"Most habits are probably good when they are first formed. That is, for many of the habits that you do not create intentionally, there must have been some value to performing that particular behavior. That value is what causes you to repeat the behavior often enough to create the habit. Some habits become bad, because a behavior that has rewarding elements to it at one time also has negative consequences that may not have been obvious when the habit began. Overeating is one such habit. You may know conceptually that eating too much is a problem. But when you actually overeat, there are few really negative consequences in the moment. So you do it again and again. Eventually, though, you’ll start to gain weight. By the time you really notice this, your habit of eating too much is deeply rooted. ",
		"Crossing the street in Los Angeles is a tricky business, but luckily, at the press of a button, we can stop traffic. Or can we?  The button’s real purpose is to make us believe we have an influence on the traffic lights, and thus we’re better able to endure the wait for the signal to change with more patience. The same goes for “door­open” and “door­close” buttons in elevators: Many are not even connected to the electrical panel. Such tricks are also designed in offices: For some people it will always be too hot, for others, too cold. Clever technicians create the illusion of control by installing fake temperature dials. This reduces energy bills―and complaints. Such tricks are called “placebo buttons” and they are being pushed in all sorts of contexts.",
		"Different creative pursuits require varying degrees of unconscious flexible thinking, in combination with varying degrees of the conscious ability to adjust it and shape it through analytical thinking. In music, for example, at one end of the creative spectrum are improvisational artists, such as jazz musicians. They have to be particularly talented at lowering their inhibitions and letting in their unconsciously generated ideas. And although the process of learning the fundamentals of jazz would require a high degree of analytical thought, that thinking style is not as big a factor during the performance. On the other end of the spectrum are those who compose complex forms, such as a symphony or concerto, that require not just imagination but also careful planning and exacting editing. We know, for example, through his letters and the reports of others, that even Mozart’s creations did not appear spontaneously, wholly formed in his consciousness, as the myths about him portray. Instead, he spent long, hard hours analyzing and reworking the ideas that arose in his unconscious, much as a scientist does when producing a theory from a germ of insight. In Mozart’s own words: “I immerse myself in music... I think about it all day long―I like experimenting―studying―reflecting...”",
		"Today, historic ideas about integrating nature and urban/suburban space find expression in various interpretations of sustainable urban planning. However, the role of social justice in these approaches remains highly controversial. For example, Landscape Urbanism is a relatively recent planning approach that advocates for native habitat designs that include diverse species and landscapes that require very low resource use. However, critics claim that Landscape Urbanists prioritize aesthetic and ecological concerns over human needs. In contrast, New Urbanism is an approach that was popularized in the 1980s and promotes walkable streets, compact design, and mixed­-use developments. But Landscape Urbanists find that these designs do not prioritize the natural environment and often involve diverting streams and disrupting natural wetlands. Still others, such as those advocating for “just sustainabilities” or “complete streets,” find that both approaches are overly idealistic and neither pays enough attention to the realities of social dynamics and systemic inequality.",
		"The intuitive ability to classify and generalize is undoubtedly a useful feature of life and research, but it carries a high cost, such as in our tendency to stereotype generalizations about people and situations. Our brain performs these tasks efficiently and automatically, usually without our awareness. The real danger of stereotypes is not their inaccuracy, but their lack of flexibility and their tendency to be preserved, even when we have enough time to stop and consider. For most people, the word stereotype arouses negative connotations: it implies a negative bias. But, in fact, stereotypes do not differ in principle from all other generalizations; generalizations about groups of people are not necessarily always negative. Intuitively and quickly, we mentally sort things into groups based on what we perceive the differences between them to be, and that is the basis for stereotyping. Only afterwards do we examine (or not examine) more evidence of how things are differentiated, and the degree and significance of the variations.",
		"Plants show finely tuned adaptive responses when nutrients are limiting. Gardeners may recognize yellow leaves as a sign of poor nutrition and the need for fertilizer. But if a plant does not have a caretaker to provide supplemental minerals, it can proliferate or lengthen its roots and develop root hairs to allow foraging in more distant soil patches. Plants can also use their memory to respond to histories of temporal or spatial variation in nutrient or resource availability. Research in this area has shown that plants are constantly aware of their position in the environment, in terms of both space and time. Plants that have experienced variable nutrient availability in the past tend to exhibit risk-taking behaviors, such as spending energy on root lengthening instead of leaf production. In contrast, plants with a history of nutrient abundance are risk averse and save energy. At all developmental stages, plants respond to environmental changes or unevenness so as to be able to use their energy for growth, survival, and reproduction, while limiting damage and nonproductive uses of their valuable energy.",
		"Gabe Gabrielson has a nine-year-old son named Colin. Like many nine-year-olds, Colin frequently finds himself in disagreement with parental policies. For example, he protested Gabe’s policy that he get fully dressed before coming down to breakfast. Gabe didn’t particularly care what Colin wore at the breakfast table, but he worried that if Colin didn’t dress first, he’d wind up late for school. “But I’m more comfortable in my pajamas!” Colin argued. After a few debates that left both of them feeling frustrated, Gabe decided to change strategy, and announced, “Okay, Colin, we’ll try it your way for three days. But if you’re late for school any of those days, then we go back to the old system.” Colin, amazed by the change in response, aced the trial run. He wore his pajamas and stayed punctual. As a result, the new practice stuck, and both sides are happier with the outcome.",
		"The impact of color has been studied for decades. For example, in a factory, the temperature was maintained at 72℉ and the walls were painted a cool blue-green. The employees complained of the cold. The temperature was maintained at the same level, but the walls were painted a warm coral. The employees stopped complaining about the temperature and reported they were quite comfortable. The psychological effects of warm and cool hues seem to be used effectively by the coaches of the Notre Dame football team. The locker rooms used for half-time breaks were reportedly painted to take advantage of the emotional impact of certain hues. The home-team room was painted a bright red, which kept team members excited or even angered. The visiting-team room was painted a blue-green, which had a calming effect on the team members. The success of this application of color can be noted in the records set by Notre Dame football teams.",
		"Food plays a large part in how much you enjoy the outdoors. The possibilities are endless, so you can constantly vary your diet. Wilderness dining has two extremes: gourmet eaters and survival eaters. The first like to make camp at lunchtime so they have several hours to set up field ovens; they bake cakes and bread and cook multi-course dinners. They walk only a few miles each day and may use the same campsite for several nights. Survival eaters eat some dry cereal for breakfast, and are up and walking within minutes of waking. They walk dozens of miles every day; lunch is a series of cold snacks eaten on the move. Dinner consists of a freeze-dried meal, “cooked” by pouring hot water into the package.",
		"Some people make few intentional changes in life. Sure, over time they may get fatter, gather lines, and go gray. But they wear their hair the same way, buy the same brand of shoes, eat the same breakfast, and stick to routines for no reason other than the ease of a comfortable, predictable life. Yet as both research and real life show, many others do make important changes. They train for marathons, quit smoking, switch fields, write plays, take up the guitar, or learn to tango even if they never danced before in their lives. What is the difference between these two groups of people? It’s their perspective. People who change do not question whether change is possible or look for reasons they cannot change. They simply decide on a change they want and do what is necessary to accomplish it. Changing, which always stems from a firm decision, becomes job number one.",
		"Surely since we all have the same visual equipment, we all see something as basic as color in the same way? Wrong. It turns out that color vision isn’t a black-and-white issue. It’s not nearly that simple. Language has a significant effect on how we “see” colors ―more precisely, on how we divide up and label different parts of the visible spectrum. Our eyes register roughly the same range of light between the aptly named infrared and ultraviolet. However, the number of differently labeled segments we use varies. Some languages only distinguish between two basic colors, black and white. Others add green, yellow, blue, and brown. This sort of different color categorization is nicely illustrated by the word “grue.” Psychologists use it to describe languages that make no distinction between green and blue.",
		"Mom and Dad went to dinner at a nice restaurant. On that first night to myself, Dad entrusted me with his movie projector and all the reels of film. He said I could do everything myself that night. So I set up the screen at one end of the living room. I turned on the projector, turned off the light, put the bowl of popcorn in my lap, and settled in to watch the film labeled HATTIE-1951. It’s one of my favorites because my third birthday party is on it and I can watch our old cat Simon jump up on the dining room table and land in a dish of ice cream. Then I can play the film backward and watch the cat fly down to the floor and see all the splashes of ice cream slurp themselves back into the dish. I made Simon jump in and out several times before I watched the rest of the film.",
		"Sometimes, after punishment has been administered a few times, it needn’t be continued, because the mere threat of punishment is enough to induce the desired behavior. Psychologists call this avoidance training because the person is learning to avoid the possibility of a punishing consequence. Avoidance training is responsible for many everyday behaviors. It has taught you to carry an umbrella when it looks like rain to avoid the punishment of getting wet, and to keep your hand away from a hot iron to avoid the punishment of a burn. Avoidance training, however, doesn’t always work in our favor. For instance, a child who has been repeatedly criticized for poor performance on math may learn to dodge difficult math problems in order to avoid further punishment. Unfortunately, because of this avoidance, the child fails to develop his math skills and therefore improve the capabilities he has, and so a vicious cycle has set in. The avoidance must be unlearned through some positive experiences with math in order for this cycle to be broken.",
		"Since group performance in problem solving is superior to even the individual work of the most expert group members, it should not be surprising that students learn better when they cooperate. However, there is one issue that needs further consideration. Specifically, the technique of having students help one another raises the question of whether students with lower ability are being helped at the expense of those with higher ability. Is this true? Not quite. Knowledge, happily, is not a zero-sum product. Higher-ability students can reinforce their own knowledge by teaching those with lower ability. In addition to that benefit, helping lower-ability students often pulls higher-ability students to a more sophisticated understanding of the material. The cliché that teachers learn as much as their pupils is certainly true.",
		"Interestingly, being observed has two quite distinct effects on performance. In some cases, performance is decreased, even to the point of non-existence. The extreme of this is stage fright, the sudden fear of public performance. There are many instances of well-known actors who, in mid-career, develop stage fright and simply cannot perform. The other extreme is that being observed enhances performance, people doing whatever it might be better when they know that others are watching. The general rule seems to be that if one is doing something new or for the first time, then being observed while doing it decreases performance. On the other hand, being observed while doing some task or engaging in some activity that is well known or well practiced tends to enhance performance. So, if you are learning to play a new sport, it is better to begin it alone, but when you become skilled at it, then you will probably perform better with an audience.",
		"Evolution works to maximize the number of descendants that an animal leaves behind. Where the risk of death from fishing increases as an animal grows, evolution favors those that grow slowly, mature younger and smaller, and reproduce earlier. This is exactly what we now see in the wild. Cod in Canada’s Gulf of St. Lawrence begin to reproduce at around four today; forty years ago they had to wait until six or seven to reach maturity. Sole in the North Sea mature at half the body weight they did in 1950. Surely these adaptations are good news for species hard-pressed by excessive fishing? Not exactly. Young fish produce many fewer eggs than large-bodied animals, and many industrial fisheries are now so intensive that few animals survive more than a couple of years beyond the age of maturity. Together this means there are fewer eggs and larvae to secure future generations. In some cases the amount of young produced today is a hundred or even a thousand times less than in the past, putting the survival of species, and the fisheries dependent on them, at grave risk.",
		"Most consumer magazines depend on subscriptions and advertising. Subscriptions account for almost 90 percent of total magazine circulation. Single-copy, or newsstand, sales account for the rest. However, single-copy sales are important: they bring in more revenue per magazine, because subscription prices are typically at least 50 percent less than the price of buying single issues. Further, potential readers explore a new magazine by buying a single issue; all those insert cards with subscription offers are included in magazines to encourage you to subscribe. Some magazines are distributed only by subscription. Professional or trade magazines are specialized magazines and are often published by professional associations. They usually feature highly targeted advertising. For example, the Columbia Journalism Review is marketed toward professional journalists and its few advertisements are news organizations, book publishers, and others. A few magazines, like Consumer Reports, work toward objectivity and therefore contain no advertising.",
		"Competition can be extremely healthy. It drives us to improve, to reach and stretch. Without it, we would never know how far we could push ourselves. In the business world, it makes our economy prosper. But there is another side to competition that isn’t so nice. In the movie Star Wars, Luke Skywalker learns about the positive energy shield called “the force,” which gives life to all things. Later, Luke confronts the evil Darth Vader and learns about the “dark side” of the force. As Darth puts it, “You don’t know the power of the dark side.” So it is with competition. There is a sunny side and a dark side, and both are powerful. The difference is this: Competition is healthy when you compete against yourself, or when it challenges you to reach and stretch and become your best. Competition becomes dark when you tie your self­-worth into winning or when you use it as a way to place yourself above another.",
		"To modern man disease is a biological phenomenon that concerns him only as an individual and has no moral implications. When he contracts influenza, he never attributes this event to his behavior toward the tax collector or his mother-in-law. Among primitives, because of their supernaturalistic theories, the prevailing moral point of view gives a deeper meaning to disease. The gods who send disease are usually angered by the moral offences of the individual. Sometimes they may not strike the guilty person himself, but rather one of his relatives or tribesmen, to whom responsibility is extended. Disease, action that might produce disease, and recovery from disease are, therefore, of vital concern to the whole primitive community. Disease, as a sanction against social misbehavior, becomes one of the most important pillars of order in such societies. It takes over, in many cases, the role played by policemen, judges, and priests in modern society.",
		"A researcher in adult education at the University of Toronto, Allen Tough wrote a paper called The Iceberg of Informal Adult Learning. Tough formulated a reverse 20/80 rule for adult learning. Twenty percent of an adult learners efforts were formal, organized by an institution. Eighty percent was informal, organized by the learner. He used the metaphor of an iceberg to describe the large portion of learning, informal learning, that remains invisible. Tough researched the reasons why people chose to learn on their own rather than attend a class. People seem to want to be in control, he wrote. They want to set their own pace and use their own style of learning; they want to keep it flexible. People also seem to consider informal learning experiential and social. Lifelong learning organized around ones interests might be seen as a new form of recreation.",
		"Understanding networks can lead to innovative, non­obvious strategies. Randomly immunizing a population to prevent the spread of infection typically requires that 80 to 100 percent of the population be immunized. To prevent measles epidemics, for example, 95 percent of the population must be immunized. A more efficient alternative is to target the hubs of the network, namely, those people at the center of the network or those with the most contacts. However, it is often not possible to discern network ties in advance in a population when trying to figure out how best to immunize it. A creative alternative is to immunize the acquaintances of randomly selected individuals. This strategy allows us to exploit a property of networks even if we cannot see the whole structure. Acquaintances have more links and are more central to the network than are the randomly chosen people who named them.",
		"Researchers in psychology follow the scientific method to perform studies that help explain and may predict human behavior. This is a much more challenging task than studying snails or sound waves. It often requires compromises, such as testing behavior within laboratories rather than natural settings, and asking those readily available (such as introduction to psychology students) to participate rather than collecting data from a true cross-section of the population. It often requires great cleverness to conceive of measures that tap into what people are thinking without altering their thinking, called reactivity. Simply knowing they are being observed may cause people to behave differently (such as more politely!). People may give answers that they feel are more socially desirable than their true feelings. But for all of these difficulties for psychology, the payoff of the scientific method is that the findings are replicable; that is, if you run the same study again following the same procedures, you will be very likely to get the same results.",
		"We’ve all heard the phrase “the family that plays together, stays together.” The wisdom in this phrase is that social play builds ties between people that are lasting and consequential. This wisdom holds outside the human family circle as well. For example, when one ground squirrel sees a predator in the distance, it will sound an alarm call that alerts other squirrels to run for cover. It’s a risky move. In crying out, the danger-spotting squirrel draws attention to itself, which may well attract the predator. Scientists used to think that animals would risk their lives like this only for kin with whom they shared common genes. New evidence suggests, however, that squirrels also sound alarm calls for former playmates, not genetically related. These squirrels developed a social resource while playing―and these buddies will put their lives on the line to save their playmates.",
		"Clearly, schematic knowledge helps you―guiding your understanding and enabling you to reconstruct things you cannot remember.",
		"Both taxi and bus drivers use a part of their brain called the hippocampus to navigate routes that can sometimes be very complicated. Who would you guess has the larger hippocampus: the taxi driver or bus driver? (C) The answer is the taxi driver. This is because taxi drivers need to take new routes quite often. To do this, they use their hippocampus intensively to memorize all kinds of routes and figure out the quickest way to reach their destinations. In contrast, most bus drivers follow the same route every day and therefore do not stimulate their hippocampus as much. Over time, the taxi driver’s role triggers a growth of neurons and synapses in the hippocampus, resulting in its increased size. Brain changes like this are the basis for seeing improvement in mental performance. So if you put away your satellite navigation system and regularly use your memory instead, you may end up with a larger hippocampus and perhaps a better memory, too.",
		"Development of the human body from a single cell provides many examples of the structural richness that is possible when the repeated production of random variation is combined with nonrandom selection. All phases of body development from embryo to adult exhibit random activities at the cellular level, and body formation depends on the new possibilities generated by these activities coupled with selection of those outcomes that satisfy previously built­in criteria. Always new structure is based on old structure, and at every stage selection favors some cells and eliminates others. The survivors serve to produce new cells that undergo further rounds of selection. Except in the immune system, cells and extensions of cells are not genetically selected during development, but rather, are positionally selected.Those in the right place that make the right connections are stimulated, and those that don’t are eliminated. This process is much like sculpting. A natural consequence of the strategy is great variability from individual to individual at the cell and molecular levels, even though large­-scale structures are quite similar.",
		"Years ago, when I was working with dogs in Europe, I witnessed an intelligence test given by some of the foremost trainers and behaviorists in the field. The test involved having various breeds of dog negotiate a high wall in order to get to the other side. Dog after dog jumped over the wall. Finally, it was the standard poodle’s turn. The poodle stood there for a moment, as if to size up the obstacle in front of him. Then he casually walked around the wall and joined his fellow competitors on the other side of it. These so­-called experts concluded that the poodle had failed the test―he hadn’t possessed the intelligence to jump over it. I, on the other hand, concluded the poodle was the smartest of all the dogs tested. When confronted with this obstacle, he analyzed the situation and chose the easiest way of achieving the goal of getting to the other side of the wall―he simply walked around it!",
		"Movies may be said to support the dominant culture and to serve as a means for its reproduction over time. But one may ask why audiences would find such movies enjoyable if all they do is give cultural directives and prescriptions for proper living. Most of us would likely grow tired of such didactic movies and would probably come to see them as propaganda, similar to the cultural artwork that was common in the Soviet Union and other autocratic societies. The simple answer to this question is that movies do more than present two-hour civics lessons or editorials on responsible behavior. They also tell stories that, in the end, we find satisfying. The bad guys are usually punished; the romantic couple almost always find each other despite the obstacles and difficulties they encounter on the path to true love; and the way we wish the world to be is how, in the movies, it more often than not winds up being. No doubt it is this utopian aspect of movies that accounts for why we enjoy them so much.",
		"In order to bring the ever­-increasing costs of home care for elderly and needy persons under control, managers of home care providers have introduced management systems. These systems specify tasks of home care workers and the time and budget available to perform these tasks. Electronic reporting systems require home care workers to report on their activities and the time spent, thus making the distribution of time and money visible and, in the perception of managers, controllable. This, in the view of managers, has contributed to the resolution of the problem. The home care workers, on the other hand, may perceive their work not as a set of separate tasks to be performed as efficiently as possible, but as a service to be provided to a client with whom they may have developed a relationship. This includes having conversations with clients and enquiring about the person’s well­being. Restricted time and the requirement to report may be perceived as obstacles that make it impossible to deliver the service that is needed. If the management systems are too rigid, this may result in home care workers becoming overloaded and demotivated.",
		"Traditionally, Kuhn claims, the primary goal of historians of science was ‘to clarify and deepen an understanding of contemporary scientific methods or concepts by displaying their evolution’. This entailed relating the progressive accumulation of breakthroughs and discoveries. Only that which survived in some form in the present was considered relevant. In the mid-1950s, however, a number of faults in this view of history became apparent. Closer analysis of scientific discoveries, for instance, led historians to ask whether the dates of discoveries and their discoverers can be identified precisely. Some discoveries seem to entail numerous phases and discoverers, none of which can be identified as definitive. Furthermore, the evaluation of past discoveries and discoverers according to present-day standards does not allow us to see how significant they may have been in their own day. Nor does the traditional view recognise the role that non-intellectual factors, especially institutional and socio-economic ones, play in scientific developments. Most importantly, however, the traditional historian of science seems blind to the fact that the concepts, questions and standards that they use to frame the past are themselves subject to historical change.",
		"Evidence of using food to heal dates back thousands of years. Ayurveda, the traditional healing art of India, is a perfect example. This healing art borrows many of its ideas from Hinduism, incorporating multiple therapies that include herbs, massage, and meditation. Ayurvedic practitioners may even go so far as to try a new food to heal. One medicinal food from Ayurveda may be familiar to you: turmeric. It often shows up as a spice in Asian cuisine. Aside from its unique flavor, turmeric may also prove a helpful treatment for people with arthritis, Alzheimer’s disease, and some forms of cancer. Although the research evidence isn’t yet conclusive, it certainly is highly recommended for these conditions. My own experience of using turmeric as an anti­-inflammatory has been extraordinarily positive.",
		"The online world is an artificial universe entirely human-made and designed. The design of the underlying system shapes how we appear and what we see of other people. It determines the structure of conversations and who has access to what information. Architects of physical cities determine the paths people will take and the sights they will see. They affect peoples mood by creating cathedrals that inspire awe and schools that encourage playfulness. It determines the structure of conversations and who has access to what information. Architects of physical cities determine the paths people will take and the sights they will see. They affect peoples mood by creating cathedrals that inspire awe and schools that encourage playfulness. They determine whether we see each others faces or instead know each other only by name. They can reveal the size and makeup of an audience, or provide the impression that one is writing intimately to only a few, even if millions are in fact reading.",
		"The objective of battle, to “throw” the enemy and to make him defenseless, may temporarily blind commanders and even strategists to the larger purpose of war. War is never an isolated act, nor is it ever only one decision. In the real world, war’s larger purpose is always a political purpose. It transcends the use of force. This insight was famously captured by Clausewitz’s most famous phrase, “War is a mere continuation of politics by other means.” To be political, a political entity or a representative of a political entity, whatever its constitutional form, has to have an intention, a will. That intention has to be clearly expressed. And one side’s will has to be transmitted to the enemy at some point during the confrontation (it does not have to be publicly communicated). A violent act and its larger political intention must also be attributed to one side at some point during the confrontation. History does not know of acts of war without eventual attribution.",
		"Experts have identified a large number of measures that promote energy efficiency. Unfortunately many of them are not cost effective. This is a fundamental requirement for energy efficiency investment from an economic perspective. However, the calculation of such cost effectiveness is not easy: it is not simply a case of looking at private costs and comparing them to the reductions achieved. There are significant externalities to take into account and there are also macroeconomic effects. For instance, at the aggregate level, improving the level of national energy efficiency has positive effects on macroeconomic issues such as energy dependence, climate change, health, national competitiveness and reducing fuel poverty. And this has direct repercussions at the individual level: households can reduce the cost of electricity and gas bills, and improve their health and comfort, while companies can increase their competitiveness and their productivity. Finally, the market for energy efficiency could contribute to the economy through job and firms creation.",
		"Sir Edward C. Burne­-Jones was a prominent nineteenth­-century English artist. One day he was invited to dinner at the home of his daughter. As a special treat, his young granddaughter was allowed to come to the table; she misbehaved, and her mother made her stand in the corner with her face to the wall. Sir Edward, a well­-trained grandfather, did not interfere with his grandchild’s training. The next morning, he arrived at his daughter’s home with paints and palette. He went to the wall where the little girl had been forced to stand, and there he painted pictures―a kitten chasing its tail, lambs in a field, and goldfish swimming. He decorated the wall on both sides of that corner with paintings for his granddaughter’s delight. If she had to stand in the corner again, at least she would have something to look at.",
		"Your story is what makes you special. But the tricky part is showing how special you are without talking about yourself. Effective personal branding isn’t about talking about yourself all the time. Although everyone would like to think that friends and family are eagerly waiting by their computers hoping to hear some news about what you’re doing, they’re not. Actually, they’re hoping you’re sitting by your computer, waiting for news about them. The best way to build your personal brand is to talk more about other people, events, and ideas than you talk about yourself. By doing so, you promote their victories and their ideas, and you become an influencer. You are seen as someone who is not only helpful, but is also a valuable resource. That helps your brand more than if you just talk about yourself over and over.",
		"According to the market response model, it is increasing prices that drive providers to search for new sources, innovators to substitute, consumers to conserve, and alternatives to emerge. Taxing certain goods or services, and so increasing prices, should result in either decreased use of these resources or creative innovation of new sources or options. The money raised through the tax can be used directly by the government either to supply services or to search for alternatives. Many examples of such “green taxes” exist. Facing landfill costs, labor expenses, and related costs in the provision of garbage disposal, for example, some cities have required households to dispose of all waste in special trash bags, purchased by consumers themselves, and often costing a dollar or more each. The results have been greatly increased recycling and more careful attention by consumers to packaging and waste. By internalizing the costs of trash to consumers, there has been an observed decrease in the flow of garbage from households.",
		"Mass customization is a strategy that allows manufacturers or retailers to provide individualized products to consumers. Today’s apparel supplier must look for new ways to offer customers top­-quality goods at highly competitive prices. Consumers desire products that can be personalized through fit preferences, color selection, fabric choices, or design characteristics. A solution to the fit preference is a body or foot scanner that takes a customer’s measurements digitally, creating what is referred to as digital twin. Based on the exact image, body scanning software then defines and captures all the measurements necessary for actually producing the garment or shoe. This data is forwarded online to the manufacturer, whose production technologies ensure an exact fit. The customer then receives the finished product in a very short time. This technological strategy is used today by some fashion firms. This type of customization is often limited, however, to a small number of customers.",
		"In spite of the likeness between the fictional and real world, the fictional world deviates from the real one in one important respect. The existing world faced by the individual is in principle an infinite chaos of events and details before it is organized by a human mind. This chaos only gets processed and modified when perceived by a human mind. The author has selected the content according to his own worldview and his own conception of relevance, in an attempt to be neutral and objective or convey a subjective view on the world. Whatever the motives, the author’s subjective conception of the world stands between the reader and the original, untouched world on which the story is based.  Because of the inner qualities with which the individual is endowed through heritage and environment, the mind functions as a filter; every outside impression that passes through it is filtered and interpreted. However, the world the reader encounters in literature is already processed and filtered by another consciousness.",
		"Many years ago I visited the chief investment officer of a large financial firm, who had just invested some tens of millions of dollars in the stock of the ABC Motor Company. When I asked how he had made that decision, he replied that he had recently attended an automobile show and had been impressed. He said, “Boy, they do know how to make a car!” His response made it very clear that he trusted his gut feeling and was satisfied with himself and with his decision. I found it remarkable that he had apparently not considered the one question that an economist would call relevant: Is the ABC stock currently underpriced? Instead, he had listened to his intuition; he liked the cars, he liked the company, and he liked the idea of owning its stock. From what we know about the accuracy of stock picking, it is reasonable to believe that he did not know what he was doing.",
		"A fascinating species of water flea exhibits a kind of flexibility that evolutionary biologists call adaptive plasticity. If the baby water flea is developing into an adult in water that includes the chemical signatures of creatures that prey on water fleas, it develops a helmet and spines to defend itself against predators. If the water around it doesn’t include the chemical signatures of predators, the water flea doesn’t develop these protective devices. That’s a clever trick, because producing spines and a helmet is costly, in terms of energy, and conserving energy is essential for an organism’s ability to survive and reproduce. The water flea only expends the energy needed to produce spines and a helmet when it needs to. So it may well be that this plasticity is an adaptation: a trait that came to exist in a species because it contributed to reproductive fitness. There are many cases, across many species, of adaptive plasticity. Plasticity is conducive to fitness if there is sufficient variation in the environment.",
		"As science moved toward experimentation to prove its theories, tools of measurement became vital. The measurement of time was probably the most important of all, but in Galileo’s time, scientists had not yet invented a dependable timepiece. Ancient humans could measure years, months, and days with the movements of Earth, the Moon, and the Sun. People in the Middle Ages tried to measure the minutes and hours of the day with a mechanical clock that used gears, wheels, and weights, but these clocks were unreliable. Galileo discovered that a pendulum always takes the same amount of time to swing whether the swing is narrow or wide. Sixteen years after Galileo’s death, the Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens attached a pendulum to the gears of a mechanical clock, and the grandfather clock was born. Humans finally knew what time it was, and science had a new important tool.",
		"Calling your pants “blue jeans” almost seems redundant because practically all denim is blue. While jeans are probably the most versatile pants in your wardrobe, blue actually isn’t a particularly neutral color. Ever wonder why it’s the most commonly used hue? Blue was the chosen color for denim because of the chemical properties of blue dye. Most dyes will permeate fabric in hot temperatures, making the color stick. The natural indigo dye used in the first jeans, on the other hand, would stick only to the outside of the threads. When the indigo­dyed denim is washed, tiny amounts of that dye get washed away, and the thread comes with them. The more denim was washed, the softer it would get, eventually achieving that worn­in, made­just­for­me feeling you probably get with your favorite jeans. That softness made jeans the trousers of choice for laborers.",
		"For a long time, random sampling was a good shortcut. It made analysis of large data problems possible in the pre-digital era. But much as converting a digital image or song into a smaller file results in loss of data, information is lost when sampling. Having the full (or close to the full) dataset provides a lot more freedom to explore, to look at the data from different angles or to look closer at certain aspects of it.  A fitting example may be the light-field camera, which captures not just a single plane of light, as with conventional cameras, but rays from the entire light field, some 11 million of them. The photographers can decide later which element of an image to focus on in the digital file. There is no need to focus at the beginning, since collecting all the information makes it possible to do that afterwards. Because rays from the entire light field are included, it is closer to all the data. As a result, the information is more “reuseable” than ordinary pictures, where the photographer has to decide what to focus on before she presses the shutter.",
		"The most commonly known form of results-based pricing is a practice called contingency pricing, used by lawyers. Contingency pricing is the major way that personal injury and certain consumer cases are billed. In this approach, lawyers do not receive fees or payment until the case is settled, when they are paid a percentage of the money that the client receives. Therefore, only an outcome in the client’s favor is compensated. From the client’s point of view, the pricing makes sense in part because most clients in these cases are unfamiliar with and possibly intimidated by law firms. Their biggest fears are high fees for a case that may take years to settle. By using contingency pricing, clients are ensured that they pay no fees until they receive a settlement. In these and other instances of contingency pricing, the economic value of the service is hard to determine before the service, and providers develop a price that allows them to share the risks and rewards of delivering value to the buyer.",
		"Your concepts are a primary tool for your brain to guess the meaning of incoming sensory inputs. For example, concepts give meaning to changes in sound pressure so you hear them as words or music instead of random noise. In Western culture, most music is based on an octave divided into twelve equally spaced pitches: the equal­tempered scale codified by Johann Sebastian Bach in the 17th century.  All people of Western culture with normal hearing have a concept for this ubiquitous scale, even if they can’t explicitly describe it. Not all music uses this scale, however. When Westerners hear Indonesian gamelan music for the first time, which is based on seven pitches per octave with varied tunings, it’s more likely to sound like noise. A brain that’s been wired by listening to twelve­tone scales doesn’t have a concept for that music.",
		"Negotiation can be defined as an attempt to explore and reconcile conflicting positions in order to reach an acceptable outcome. Whatever the nature of the outcome, which may actually favour one party more than another, the purpose of negotiation is the identification of areas of common interest and conflict. In this sense, depending on the intentions of the parties, the areas of common interest may be clarified, refined and given negotiated form and substance. Areas of difference can and do frequently remain, and will perhaps be the subject of future negotiations, or indeed remain irreconcilable. In those instances in which the parties have highly antagonistic or polarised relations, the process is likely to be dominated by the exposition, very often in public, of the areas of conflict. In these and sometimes other forms of negotiation, negotiation serves functions other than reconciling conflicting interests. These will include delay, publicity, diverting attention or seeking intelligence about the other party and its negotiating position.",
		"If you drive down a busy street, you will find many competing businesses, often right next to one another. For example, in most places a consumer in search of a quick meal has many choices, and more fast­food restaurants appear all the time. These competing firms advertise heavily. The temptation is to see advertising as driving up the price of a product without any benefit to the consumer. However, this misconception doesn’t account for why firms advertise. In markets where competitors sell slightly differentiated products, advertising enables firms to inform their customers about new products and services. Yes, costs rise, but consumers also gain information to help make purchasing decisions. Consumers also benefit from added variety, and we all get a product that’s pretty close to our vision of a perfect good—and no other market structure delivers that outcome.",
		"Permission marketing is a term coined by Seth Godin, meaning that the customer has given his or her consent to receive marketing messages from an organization. As such, the customer is more receptive to the organization because the messages are anticipated, personal, and relevant. The opposite of permission marketing is interruption marketing, which Godin claims, can lead to a ‘lose-lose’ situation. Interruption marketing occurs when the customer receives unrequested direct marketing messages, such as direct mail, telephone calls, e-mails, and text messages. Godin argues that these things often end up wasting the customer’s time-and therefore lead to frustration. It is no coincidence that they are commonly referred to in the negative terms ‘junk mail’ and ‘spam,’ because they are unwelcome. All too often the final result is a frustrated customer with no intention of buying and a marketer who has wasted his budget―‘lose-lose.’",
		"Norms emerge in groups as a result of people conforming to the behavior of others. Thus, the start of a norm occurs when one person acts in a particular manner in a particular situation because she thinks she ought to. Others may then conform to this behavior for a number of reasons. The person who performed the initial action may think that others ought to behave as she behaves in situations of this sort. Thus, she may prescribe the behavior to them by uttering the norm statement in a prescriptive manner. Alternately, she may communicate that conformity is desired in other ways, such as by gesturing. In addition, she may threaten to sanction them for not behaving as she wishes. This will cause some to conform to her wishes and act as she acts. But some others will not need to have the behavior prescribed to them. They will observe the regularity of behavior and decide on their own that they ought to conform. They may do so for either rational or moral reasons.",
		"Architects might say a machine can never design an innovative or impressive building because a computer cannot be “creative.” Yet consider the Elbphilharmonie, a new concert hall in Hamburg, which contains a remarkably beautiful auditorium composed of ten thousand interlocking acoustic panels. It is the sort of space that makes one instinctively think that only a human being—and a human with a remarkably refined creative sensibility, at that—could design something so aesthetically impressive. Yet the auditorium was, in fact, designed algorithmically, using a technique known as “parametric design.” The architects gave the system a set of criteria, and it generated a set of possible designs for the architects to choose from. Similar software has been used to design lightweight bicycle frames and sturdier chairs, among much else. Are these systems behaving “creatively”? No, they are using lots of processing power to blindly generate varied possible designs, working in a very different way from a human being.",
		"During the late 1800s, printing became cheaper and faster, leading to an explosion in the number of newspapers and magazines and the increased use of images in these publications. Photographs, as well as woodcuts and engravings of them, appeared in newspapers and magazines. The increased number of newspapers and magazines created greater competition—driving some papers to print more salacious articles to attract readers. This “yellow journalism” sometimes took the form of gossip about public figures, as well as about socialites who considered themselves private figures, and even about those who were not part of high society but had found themselves involved in a scandal, crime, or tragedy that journalists thought would sell papers. Gossip was of course nothing new, but the rise of mass media in the form of widely distributed newspapers and magazines meant that gossip moved from limited (often oral only) distribution to wide, printed dissemination.",
		"Cultural characteristics are not only passed from parents to children, but may be passed on from any one individual to another by word of mouth or by writing. So some cultural changes may be adopted quite quickly by a whole population. Transmission of culture is rather like transmission of an infection. Flu and colds spread very quickly, especially with the large amount of contact that people now have with each other. Like those infectious diseases, cultural habits such as pop music preferences and clothing fashions may spread very quickly nowadays, especially through the media of radio and television. However, other deep-rooted cultural characteristics of races and racial subgroups are much more difficult to change. These are the cultural patterns that are so resistant to alteration that they have the appearance of being inherent.",
		"When evaluating a policy, people tend to concentrate on how the policy will fix some particular problem while ignoring or downplaying other effects it may have. Economists often refer to this situation as The Law of Unintended Consequences. For instance, suppose that you impose a tariff on imported steel in order to protect the jobs of domestic steelworkers. If you impose a high enough tariff, their jobs will indeed be protected from competition by foreign steel companies. But an unintended consequence is that the jobs of some autoworkers will be lost to foreign competition. Why? The tariff that protects steelworkers raises the price of the steel that domestic automobile makers need to build their cars. As a result, domestic automobile manufacturers have to raise the prices of their cars, making them relatively less attractive than foreign cars. Raising prices tends to reduce domestic car sales, so some domestic autoworkers lose their jobs.",
		"Some fad diets might have you running a caloric deficit, and while this might encourage weight loss, it has no effect on improving body composition, and it could actually result in a loss of muscle mass. Calorie restriction can also cause your metabolism to slow down, and significantly reduce energy levels. Controlling caloric intake to deliver the proper amount of calories so that the body has the energy it needs to function and heal is the only proper approach. Your body also needs the right balance of key macronutrients to heal and grow stronger. These macronutrients, which include protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats, can help your body maximize its ability to repair, rebuild, and grow stronger. Timing is also important. By eating the right combinations of these key macronutrients at strategic intervals throughout the day, we can help our bodies heal and grow even faster.",
		"Species that are found in only one area are called endemic species and are especially vulnerable to extinction. They exist on islands and in other unique small areas, especially in tropical rain forests where most species are highly specialized. One example is the brilliantly colored golden toad once found only in a small area of lush rain forests in Costa Rica’s mountainous region. Despite living in the country’s well­protected Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve, by 1989, the golden toad had apparently become extinct. Much of the moisture that supported its rain forest habitat came in the form of moisture­laden clouds blowing in from the Caribbean Sea. But warmer air from global climate change caused these clouds to rise, depriving the forests of moisture, and the habitat for the golden toad and many other species dried up. The golden toad appears to be one of the first victims of climate change caused largely by global warming.",
		"The timing of positive versus negative behavior seems to influence attraction. Several studies have identified what has been called the loss-gain effect. This effect reflects what happens to attraction when a person’s behavior moves from positive to negative or from negative to positive. For example, if someone seemed very nice to you early in the interaction, but then began to act like a fool, would you be more attracted to that person than if that person were a fool from the start? Studies suggest that you would not. In fact, people are more attracted to individuals who are consistently negative than to people who initially behave positively and then switch to negative behavior. The reason is this: people who start out being nice get our hopes up, so the letdown we experience when we discover that they are not nice makes it worse than if they had acted badly from the start.",
		"Like positive habits, bad habits exist on a continuum of easy‑to‑change and hard‑to‑change. When you get toward the “hard” end of the spectrum, note the language you hear—breaking bad habits and battling addiction. It’s as if an unwanted behavior is a nefarious villain to be aggressively defeated. But this kind of language (and the approaches it spawns) frames these challenges in a way that isn’t helpful or effective. I specifically hope we will stop using this phrase: “break a habit.” This language misguides people. The word “break” sets the wrong expectation for how you get rid of a bad habit. This word implies that if you input a lot of force in one moment, the habit will be gone. However, that rarely works, because you usually cannot get rid of an unwanted habit by applying force one time.",
		"One of the first things I did in each classroom in South Milwaukee was to draw a diagram of the students’ desks, labelled with their names, as an aid to recognizing them. At lunch in the first grade classroom the first day I was present, a group of students came over, saw the diagram, and began finding their names on my picture. One said, “Where’s your name?” and was not satisfied until I included a sketch of the chair by the bookcase where I was sitting, labelled with my name. It had not occurred to me that I needed to be included: after all, I knew where I was sitting, and knew my name. But to her, my presence in the classroom was the newest, most noteworthy thing that had occurred that day, and it was logical to include me. Her point of view was different from mine, and resulted in a different diagram of the classroom.",
		"A common but incorrect assumption is that we are creatures of reason when, in fact, we are creatures of both reason and emotion. We cannot get by on reason alone since any reason always eventually leads to a feeling. Should I get a wholegrain cereal or a chocolate cereal? I can list all the reasons I want, but the reasons have to be based on something. For example, if my goal is to eat healthy, I can choose the wholegrain cereal, but what is my reason for wanting to be healthy? I can list more and more reasons such as wanting to live longer, spending more quality time with loved ones, etc., but what are the reasons for those reasons? You should be able to see by now that reasons are ultimately based on non‑reason such as values, feelings, or emotions. These deep‑seated values, feelings, and emotions we have are rarely a result of reasoning, but can certainly be influenced by reasoning. We have values, feelings, and emotions before we begin to reason and long before we begin to reason effectively.",
		"A little boy sees and hears birds with delight. Then the “good father” comes along and feels he should “share” the experience and help his son “develop.” He says: “That’s a jay, and this is a sparrow.” The moment the little boy is concerned with which is a jay and which is a sparrow, he can no longer see the birds or hear them sing. He has to see and hear them the way the father wants him to. Father has good reasons on his side, since few people can go through life listening to the birds sing, and the sooner the boy starts his “education” the better. Maybe he will be an ornithologist when he grows up. A few people, however, can still see and hear in the old way. But most of the members of the human race have lost the capacity to be painters, poets, or musicians, and are not left the option of seeing and hearing directly even if they can afford to; they must get it secondhand.",
		"In experientialism, the body is seen as playing a decisive role in producing the kind of mind we have. The mind is based on the body. In other words, the kind of body humans have influences the kind of mind they have. As a result, thought is taken to be embodied. As an example, take the conceptual category of TREE. How can the body play any role in our understanding what a tree is? For one thing, we understand a tree as being upright. This comes from how we experience our own bodies; namely, that we experience ourselves as being erect. For another, we see a tree as tall. The aspect of tallness only makes sense with respect to our standard evaluation of the body’s relative height. A tree is tall relative to our average human size. In this way, categories of mind are defined by the body’s interaction with the environment. We call such features of conceptual categories “interactional properties.”",
		"The right to be forgotten is a right distinct from but related to a right to privacy. The right to privacy is, among other things, the right for information traditionally regarded as protected or personal not to be revealed. The right to be forgotten, in contrast, can be applied to information that has been in the public domain. The right to be forgotten broadly includes the right of an individual not to be forever defined by information from a specific point in time.  One motivation for such a right is to allow individuals to move on with their lives and not be defined by a specific event or period in their lives. For example, it has long been recognized in some countries, such as the UK and France, that even past criminal convictions should eventually be “spent” and not continue to affect a person’s life.  Despite the reason for supporting the right to be forgotten, the right to be forgotten can sometimes come into conflict with other rights. For example, formal exceptions are sometimes made for security or public health reasons.",
		"Without money, people could only barter. Many of us barter to a small extent, when we return favors. A man might offer to mend his neighbor’s broken door in return for a few hours of babysitting, for instance. Yet it is hard to imagine these personal exchanges working on a larger scale. What would happen if you wanted a loaf of bread and all you had to trade was your new car? Barter depends on the double coincidence of wants, where not only does the other person happen to have what I want, but I also have what he wants. Money solves all these problems. There is no need to find someone who wants what you have to trade; you simply pay for your goods with money. The seller can then take the money and buy from someone else. Money is transferable and deferrable ―the seller can hold on to it and buy when the time is right.",
		"Using emotional language is a way to get your audience not only to understand your argument but also to feel it. A few years ago I was involved in a campaign for a bill to fund an extra lane for a local freeway. The county wanted to run promotional ads for the bill promising to “improve our roads” and “reduce commute time.” Probably folks might like the idea of that, but they won’t necessarily bother to leave the house to go vote for it. People don’t care about traffic unless they are stuck in it and missing their children’s soccer practice. A better approach was to run ads asking, “Wouldn’t it be nice to get to your child’s practice on time for once?” or, “Wouldn’t you like to get home early enough to have dinner with your family every night?” That helped voters picture exactly how the expanded freeway would improve their lives.",
		"To an economist who succeeds in figuring out a person’s preference structure—understanding whether the satisfaction gained from consuming one good is greater than that of another—explaining behavior in terms of changes in underlying likes and dislikes is usually highly problematic. To argue, for instance, that the baby boom and then the baby bust resulted from an increase and then a decrease in the public’s inherent taste for children, rather than a change in relative prices against a background of stable preferences, places a social scientist in an unsound position. In economics, such an argument about birth rates would be equivalent to saying that a rise and fall in mortality could be attributed to an increase in the inherent desire change for death. For an economist, changes in income and prices, rather than changes in tastes, affect birth rates. When income rises, for example, people want more children (or, as you will see later, more satisfaction derived from children), even if their inherent desire for children stays the same.",
		"Brain research provides a framework for understanding how the brain processes and internalizes athletic skills. In practicing a complex movement such as a golf swing, we experiment with different grips, positions and swing movements, analyzing each in terms of the results it yields. This is a conscious, left­brain process. Once we identify those elements of the swing that produce the desired results, we rehearse them over and over again in an attempt to record them permanently in “muscle memory.” In this way, we internalize the swing as a kinesthetic feeling that we trust to recreate the desired swing on demand. This internalization transfers the swing from a consciously controlled left­brain function to a more intuitive or automatic right­brain function. This description, despite being an oversimplification of the actual processes involved, serves as a model for the interaction between conscious and unconscious actions in the brain, as it learns to perfect an athletic skill.",
		"If you walk into a store looking for a new computer and the first salesperson you meet immediately points to a group of computers and says, “Any of those are good,” and then walks away, there is a good chance you will walk away, too, and with good reason. Why? You were never asked what you were seeking, how much you could spend, or if the computer would be used for business or pleasure or your child’s homework assignments. In brief, the salesperson never considered or asked about your needs and preferences. Just as it would come as no surprise to learn the salesperson who was indifferent to a potential customer’s needs was soon out of a job, the same holds true for writers who ignore their readers. That is, the reader is the writer’s “customer” and one whose business or approval is one we need to seek. The more you know about your reader, the greater the chances you will meet his or her needs and expectations.",
		"If DNA were the only thing that mattered, there would be no particular reason to build meaningful social programs to pour good experiences into children and protect them from bad experiences. But brains require the right kind of environment if they are to correctly develop. When the first draft of the Human Genome Project came to completion at the turn of the millennium, one of the great surprises was that humans have only about twenty thousand genes. This number came as a surprise to biologists: given the complexity of the brain and the body, it had been assumed that hundreds of thousands of genes would be required. So how does the massively complicated brain, with its eighty‐six billion neurons, get built from such a small recipe book? The answer relies on a clever strategy implemented by the genome: build incompletely and let world experience refine.",
		"You know that forks don’t fly off to the Moon and that neither apples nor anything else on Earth cause the Sun to crash down on us. The reason these things don’t happen is that the strength of gravity’s pull depends on two things. The first is the mass of the object. The apple is very small, and doesn’t have much mass, so its pull on the Sun is absolutely tiny, certainly much smaller than the pull of all the planets. The Earth has more mass than tables, trees, or apples, so almost everything in the world is pulled towards the Earth. That’s why apples fall from trees. Now, you might know that the Sun is much bigger than Earth and has much more mass. So why don’t apples fly off towards the Sun? The reason is that the pull of gravity also depends on the distance to the object doing the pulling. Although the Sun has much more mass than the Earth, we are much closer to the Earth, so we feel its gravity more.",
		"One benefit of reasons and arguments is that they can foster humility. If two people disagree without arguing, all they do is yell at each other. No progress is made. Both still think that they are right. In contrast, if both sides give arguments that articulate reasons for their positions, then new possibilities open up. One of the arguments gets refuted—that is, it is shown to fail. In that case, the person who depended on the refuted argument learns that he needs to change his view. That is one way to achieve humility—on one side at least. Another possibility is that neither argument is refuted. Both have a degree of reason on their side. Even if neither person involved is convinced by the other’s argument, both can still come to appreciate the opposing view. They also realize that, even if they have some truth, they do not have the whole truth. They can gain humility when they recognize and appreciate the reasons against their own view.",
		"According to one traditional definition, aesthetics is the branch of philosophy that deals with beauty, especially beauty in the arts. Examining the pleasing features of the Mona Lisa or a snow-capped mountain, for example, would come under aesthetics. That definition seems too narrow, however, since works of art and natural objects may interest us in other ways than by being beautiful. Instead of evoking admiration of beauty, artists may evoke puzzlement, shock, and even disgust. Consider Picasso’s Guernica, a huge (11-ft.×25.6-ft.) painting in black, white, and grey that he made in response to the slaughter of Spanish civilians by German and Italian warplanes during the Spanish Civil War. Images of a cruel war dominate the canvas. This work is widely admired but not for being beautiful. So a better definition of aesthetics would be that it is the branch of philosophy that deals with the ways things please people in being experienced.",
		"Testing strategies relating to direct assessment of content knowledge still have their value in an inquiry­-driven classroom. Let’s pretend for a moment that we wanted to ignore content and only assess a student’s skill with investigations. The problem is that the skills and the content are interconnected. When a student fails at pattern analysis, it could be because they do not understand how to do the pattern analysis properly. However, it also could be that they did not understand the content that they were trying to build patterns with. Sometimes students will understand the processes of inquiry well, and be capable of skillfully applying social studies disciplinary strategies, yet fail to do so because they misinterpret the content. For these reasons, we need a measure of a student’s content understanding. To do this right, we need to make sure our assessment is getting us accurate measures of whether our students understand the content they use in an inquiry.",
		"Touch receptors are spread over all parts of the body, but they are not spread evenly. Most of the touch receptors are found in your fingertips, tongue, and lips.  On the tip of each of your fingers, for example, there are about five thousand separate touch receptors. In other parts of the body there are far fewer. In the skin of your back, the touch receptors may be as much as 2 inches apart.  You can test this for yourself. Have someone poke you in the back with one, two, or three fingers and try to guess how many fingers the person used. If the fingers are close together, you will probably think it was only one. But if the fingers are spread far apart, you can feel them individually. Yet if the person does the same thing on the back of your hand (with your eyes closed, so that you don’t see how many fingers are being used), you probably will be able to tell easily, even when the fingers are close together.",
		"One interesting feature of network markets is that “history matters.” A famous example is the QWERTY keyboard used with your computer. The keyboard was designed to keep frequently used keys (like E and O) physically separated in order to prevent them from jamming. By the time the technology for electronic typing evolved, millions of people had already learned to type on millions of QWERTY typewriters. You might wonder why this particular configuration of keys, with its awkward placement of the letters, became the standard. The QWERTY keyboard in the 19th century was developed in the era of manual typewriters with physical keys. Replacing the QWERTY keyboard with a more efficient design would have been both expensive and difficult to coordinate. Thus, the placement of the letters stays with the obsolete QWERTY on today’s English­language keyboards.",
		"Gold is a relatively soft metal, so much so that rings are very rarely made from pure gold metal because they get scratched quickly. But if you alloy gold, by adding a small percentage of other metals such as silver or copper, you not only change the color of the gold—silver making the gold whiter, and copper making the gold redder—you make the gold harder, much harder. This changing of the properties of metals by very small additions of other ingredients is what makes the study of metals so fascinating. In the case of gold alloys, you might wonder where the silver atoms go. The answer is that they sit inside the gold crystal structure, taking the place of a gold atom, and it is this atom substitution inside the crystal lattice of the gold that makes it stronger.",
		"The lotus plant (a white water lily) grows in the dirty, muddy bottom of lakes and ponds, yet despite this, its leaves are always clean. That is because whenever the smallest particle of dust lands on the plant, it immediately waves the leaf, directing the dust particles to one particular spot. Raindrops falling on the leaves are sent to that same place, to thus wash the dirt away. This property of the lotus led researchers to design a new house paint. Researchers began working on how to develop paints that wash clean in the rain, in much the same way as lotus leaves do. As a result of this investigation, a German company produced a house paint. On the market in Europe and Asia, the product even came with a guarantee that it would stay clean for five years without detergents or sandblasting.",
		"Like the physiological discoveries of the late nineteenth century, today’s biological breakthrough has fundamentally altered our understanding of how the human organism works and will change medical practice fundamentally and thoroughly. The word “breakthrough,” however, seems to imply in many people’s minds an amazing, unprecedented revelation that, in an instant, makes everything clear. Science doesn’t actually work that way. Remember the scientific method, which you probably first learned about back in elementary school? It has a long and difficult process of observation, hypothesis, experiment, testing, modifying, retesting, and retesting again and again and again. That’s how science works, and the breakthrough understanding of the relationship between our genes and chronic disease happened in just that way, building on the work of scientists from decades―even centuries―ago. In fact, it is still happening; the story continues to unfold as the research presses on.",
		"The ancient Greeks used to describe two very different ways of thinking—logos and mythos. Logos roughly referred to the world of the logical, the empirical, the scientific. Mythos referred to the world of dreams, storytelling and symbols. Like many rationalists today, some philosophers of Greece prized logos and looked down at mythos. Logic and reason, they concluded, make us modern; storytelling and mythmaking are primitive. But lots of scholars then and now—including many anthropologists, sociologists and philosophers today— see a more complicated picture, where mythos and logos are intertwined and interdependent. Science itself, according to this view, relies on stories. The frames and metaphors we use to understand the world shape the scientific discoveries we make; they even shape what we see. When our frames and metaphors change, the world itself is transformed. The Copernican Revolution involved more than just scientific calculation; it involved a new story about the place of Earth in the universe.",
		"A female lawyer working for a prestigious New York law firm once accompanied the male CEO of a major client to Latin America to negotiate a complex deal. Soon after they arrived, the head of the prospective Latin American partner suggested that he and the CEO go off together to discuss business―while his wife and the lawyer go shopping. The lawyer was outraged, assuming this to be an example of Latin American gender bias. Before voicing her objections, however, she called a colleague back in New York, who told her that he, too, had been excluded from preliminary talks during his last negotiation in that country. The Latin American executive was just looking for a diplomatic way to get her out of the picture as a lawyer, not as a woman. It was the local practice, the colleague suggested, for lawyers to negotiate only with other lawyers, not with the businesspeople. Had the woman lawyer insisted on participating, she would have spoiled the deal and destroyed her credibility.",
		"There is no doubt that the length of some literary works is overwhelming. Reading or translating a work in class, hour after hour, week after week, can be such a boring experience that many students never want to open a foreign language book again. Extracts provide one type of solution. The advantages are obvious: reading a series of passages from different works produces more variety in the classroom, so that the teacher has a greater chance of avoiding monotony, while still giving learners a taste at least of an author’s special flavour. On the other hand, a student who is only exposed to ‘bite­sized chunks’ will never have the satisfaction of knowing the overall pattern of a book, which is after all the satisfaction most of us seek when we read something in our own language. Moreover, there are some literary features that cannot be adequately illustrated by a short excerpt: the development of plot or character, for instance, with the gradual involvement of the reader that this implies; or the unfolding of a complex theme through the juxtaposition of contrasting views.",
		"Habits create the foundation for mastery. In chess, it is only after the basic movements of the pieces have become automatic that a player can focus on the next level of the game. Each chunk of information that is memorized opens up the mental space for more effortful thinking. This is true for anything you attempt. When you know the simple movements so well that you can perform them without thinking, you are free to pay attention to more advanced details. In this way, habits are the backbone of any pursuit of excellence. However, the benefits of habits come at a cost. At first, each repetition develops fluency, speed, and skill. But then, as a habit becomes automatic, you become less sensitive to feedback. You fall into mindless repetition. It becomes easier to let mistakes slide. When you can do it “good enough” automatically, you stop thinking about how to do it better.",
		"Who could deny that the human body is a miracle? Imagine: each of us is safely housed within a bundle of blood, bone, and guts nurturing a little glow of life while suspended in a sea of constant change and danger. The miracle becomes even more amazing when you consider the long, slow, evolutionary process of give and take that produced the human body. Our bodies developed with nature, within it, as part of it, over time. Housing, likewise, originally developed slowly within particular human cultures and in response to specific climates and environments. Each culture around the world crafted a unique style of housing from the fabric of their surroundings. In other words, traditional housing approaches were specific to the culture, climate, and environment. Consider the igloo, a building using the thermal mass of ice to enclose heat and resist snow, or the ancient Egyptians’ ventilation domes that produced interior cooling amid burning desert heat.",
		"Regarding food production, under the British government, there was a different conception of responsibility from that of French government. In France, the responsibility for producing good food lay with the producers. The state would police their activities and, if they should fail, would punish them for neglecting the interests of its citizens. By contrast, the British government—except in extreme cases—placed most of the responsibility with the individual consumers. It would be unfair to interfere with the shopkeeper’s right to make money. In the 1840s, a patent was granted for a machine designed for making fake coffee beans out of chicory, using the same technology that went into manufacturing bullets. This machine was clearly designed for the purposes of swindling, and yet the government allowed it. A machine for forging money would never have been licensed, so why this? As one consumer complained, the British system of government was weighted against the consumer in favour of the swindler.",
		"Regardless of whether the people existing after agriculture were happier, healthier, or neither, it is undeniable that there were more of them. Agriculture both supports and requires more people to grow the crops that sustain them. Estimates vary, of course, but evidence points to an increase in the human population from 1-5 million people worldwide to a few hundred million once agriculture had become established. And a larger population doesn’t just mean increasing the size of everything, like buying a bigger box of cereal for a larger family. It brings qualitative changes in the way people live. For example, more people means more kinds of diseases, particularly when those people are sedentary. Those groups of people can also store food for long periods, which creates a society with haves and have­-nots.",
		"Because we are told that the planet is doomed, we do not register the growing number of scientific studies demonstrating the resilience of other species. For instance, climate-driven disturbances are affecting the world’s coastal marine ecosystems more frequently and with greater intensity.  This is a global problem that demands urgent action. Yet, as detailed in a 2017 paper in BioScience, there are also instances where marine ecosystems show remarkable resilience to acute climatic events.  In a region in Western Australia, for instance, up to 90 percent of live coral was lost when ocean water temperatures rose, causing what scientists call coral bleaching. Yet in some sections of the reef surface, 44 percent of the corals recovered within twelve years.  Similarly, kelp forests hammered by intense El Niño water-temperature increases recovered within five years. By studying these “bright spots,” situations where ecosystems persist even in the face of major climatic impacts, we can learn what management strategies help to minimize destructive forces and nurture resilience.",
		"The invention of the mechanical clock was influenced by monks who lived in monasteries that were the examples of order and routine. They had to keep accurate time so that monastery bells could be rung at regular intervals to announce the seven hours of the day reserved for prayer. Early clocks were nothing more than a weight tied to a rope wrapped around a revolving drum. Time was determined by watching the length of the weighted rope. The discovery of the pendulum in the seventeenth century led to the widespread use of clocks and enormous public clocks. Eventually, keeping time turned into serving time. People started to follow the mechanical time of clocks rather than their natural body time. They ate at meal time, rather than when they were hungry, and went to bed when it was time, rather than when they were sleepy. Even periodicals and fashions became “yearly.” The world had become orderly.",
		"Adolescence is a stage of development in which teens have superb cognitive abilities and high rates of learning and memory because they are still riding on the heightened synaptic plasticity of childhood. These abilities give them a distinct advantage over adults, but because they are so primed to learn, they are also extremely vulnerable to learning the wrong things. How does this happen? It is all because the brain wants rewards and anything that is learned, good or bad, that stimulates the production of dopamine is interpreted by the brain as a reward. This means a little bit of stimulation to a teenage brain whose synapses are firing all over the place leads to wanting more stimulation that can, in certain situations, result in a kind of over-learning. The more commonly known name for this over-learning is addiction.",
		"When trying to sustain an independent ethos, cultures face a problem of critical mass. No single individual, acting on his or her own, can produce an ethos.  Rather, an ethos results from the interdependent acts of many individuals. This cluster of produced meaning may require some degree of insulation from larger and wealthier outside forces. The Canadian Inuit maintain their own ethos, even though they number no more than twenty­four thousand. They manage this feat through a combination of trade, to support their way of life, and geographic isolation. The Inuit occupy remote territory, removed from major population centers of Canada. If cross­cultural contact were to become sufficiently close, the Inuit ethos would disappear. Distinct cultural groups of similar size do not, in the long run, persist in downtown Toronto, Canada, where they come in contact with many outside influences and pursue essentially Western paths for their lives.",
		"Since we know we can’t completely eliminate our biases, we need to try to limit the harmful impacts they can have on the objectivity and rationality of our decisions and judgments. It is important that we are aware when one of our cognitive biases is activated and make a conscious choice to overcome that bias. We need to be aware of the impact the bias has on our decision making process and our life. Then we can choose an appropriate de‒biasing strategy to combat it. After we have implemented a strategy, we should check in again to see if it worked in the way we had hoped. If it did, we can move on and make an objective and informed decision. If it didn’t, we can try the same strategy again or implement a new one until we are ready to make a rational judgment.",
		"Heat is lost at the surface, so the more surface area you have relative to volume, the harder you must work to stay warm. That means that little creatures have to produce heat more rapidly than large creatures.  They must therefore lead completely different lifestyles. An elephant’s heart beats just thirty times a minute, a human’s sixty, a cow’s between fifty and eighty, but a mouse’s beats six hundred times a minute—ten times a second. Every day, just to survive, the mouse must eat about 50 percent of its own body weight.  We humans, by contrast, need to consume only about 2 percent of our body weight to supply our energy requirements. One area where animals are curiously uniform is with the number of heartbeats they have in a lifetime. Despite the vast differences in heart rates, nearly all mammals have about 800 million heartbeats in them if they live an average life. The exception is humans. We pass 800 million heartbeats after twenty­five years, and just keep on going for another fifty years and 1.6 billion heartbeats or so.",
		"The ancient Greeks sought to improve memory through brain training methods such as memory palaces and the method of loci. At the same time, they and the Egyptians became experts at externalizing information, inventing the modern library, a grand storehouse for externalized knowledge. We don’t know why these simultaneous explosions of intellectual activity occurred when they did (perhaps daily human experience had hit a certain level of complexity). But the human need to organize our lives, our environment, even our thoughts, remains strong. This need isn’t simply learned; it is a biological imperative—animals organize their environments instinctively. Most mammals are biologically programmed to put their digestive waste away from where they eat and sleep. Dogs have been known to collect their toys and put them in baskets; ants carry off dead members of the colony to burial grounds; certain birds and rodents create barriers around their nests in order to more easily detect invaders.",
		"When a change in the environment occurs, there is a relative increase or decrease in the rate at which the neurons fire, which is how intensity is coded. Furthermore, relativity operates to calibrate our sensations. For example, if you place one hand in hot water and the other in iced water for some time before immersing them both into lukewarm water, you will experience conflicting sensations of temperature because of the relative change in the receptors registering hot and cold. Although both hands are now in the same water, one feels that it is colder and the other feels warmer because of the relative change from prior experience. This process, called adaptation, is one of the organizing principles operating throughout the central nervous system. It explains why you can’t see well inside a dark room if you have come in from a sunny day. Your eyes have to become accustomed to the new level of luminance. Adaptation explains why apples taste sour after eating sweet chocolate and why traffic seems louder in the city if you normally live in the country.",
		"When an important change takes place in your life, observe your response. If you resist accepting the change it is because you are afraid; afraid of losing something. Perhaps you might lose your position, property, possession, or money. The change might mean that you lose privileges or prestige. Perhaps with the change you lose the closeness of a person or a place. In life, all these things come and go and then others appear, which will also go. It is like a river in constant movement. If we try to stop the flow, we create a dam; the water stagnates and causes a pressure which accumulates inside us. To learn to let go, to not cling and allow the flow of the river, is to live without resistances; being the creators of constructive changes that bring about improvements and widen our horizons.",
		"Consider the story of two men quarreling in a library. One wants the window open and the other wants it closed. They argue back and forth about how much to leave it open: a crack, halfway, or three‑quarters of the way.  No solution satisfies them both. Enter the librarian. She asks one why he wants the window open: “To get some fresh air.” She asks the other why he wants it closed: “To avoid a draft.” After thinking a minute, she opens wide a window in the next room, bringing in fresh air without a draft. This story is typical of many negotiations. Since the parties’ problem appears to be a conflict of positions, they naturally tend to talk about positions—and often reach an impasse. The librarian could not have invented the solution she did if she had focused only on the two men’s stated positions of wanting the window open or closed. Instead, she looked to their underlying interests of fresh air and no draft.",
		"In one survey, 61 percent of Americans said that they supported the government spending more on ‘assistance to the poor’.  But when the same population was asked whether they supported spending more government money on ‘welfare’, only 21 percent were in favour. In other words, if you ask people about individual welfare programmes—such as giving financial help to people who have long‑term illnesses and paying for school meals for families with low income—people are broadly in favour of them.  But if you ask about ‘welfare’—which refers to those exact same programmes that you’ve just listed—they’re against it. The word ‘welfare’ has negative connotations, perhaps because of the way many politicians and newspapers portray it. Therefore, the framing of a question can heavily influence the answer in many ways, which matters if your aim is to obtain a ‘true measure’ of what people think. And next time you hear a politician say ‘surveys prove that the majority of the people agree with me’, be very wary.",
		"Imitation seems to be a key to the transmission of valuable practices among nonhumans. The most famous example is that of the macaque monkeys on the island of Koshima in Japan. In the early 1950s, Imo, a one-year-old female macaque, somehow hit upon the idea of washing her sweet potatoes in a stream before eating them. Soon it was hard to find a Koshima macaque who wasn’t careful to wash off her sweet potato before eating it. A few years later, Imo introduced another innovation. Researchers on the island occasionally gave the monkeys wheat (in addition to sweet potatoes). But the wheat was given to them on the beach, where it quickly became mixed with sand. Imo, though, realized that if you threw a handful of wheat and sand into the ocean, the sand would sink and the wheat would float. Again, within a few years most of her fellow macaques were throwing wheat and sand into the sea and obtaining the benefits.",
		"Mark Granovetter examined the extent to which information about jobs flowed through weak versus strong ties among a group of people. He found that only a sixth of jobs that came via the network were from strong ties, with the rest coming via medium or weak ties; and with more than a quarter coming via weak ties. Strong ties can be more homophilistic. Our closest friends are often those who are most like us. This means that they might have information that is most relevant to us, but it also means that it is information to which we may already be exposed. In contrast, our weaker relationships are often with people who are more distant both geographically and demographically. Their information is more novel. Even though we talk to these people less frequently, we have so many weak ties that they end up being a sizable source of information, especially of information to which we don’t otherwise have access.",
		"Once we recognize the false­-cause issue, we see it everywhere. For example, a recent long­term study of University of Toronto medical students concluded that medical school class presidents lived an average of 2.4 years less than other medical school graduates. At first glance, this seemed to imply that being a medical school class president is bad for you. Does this mean that you should avoid being medical school class president at all costs? Probably not. Just because being class president is correlated with shorter life expectancy does not mean that it causes shorter life expectancy. In fact, it seems likely that the sort of person who becomes medical school class president is, on average, extremely hard­working, serious, and ambitious.  Perhaps this extra stress, and the corresponding lack of social and relaxation time―rather than being class president per se―contributes to lower life expectancy. If so, the real lesson of the study is that we should all relax a little and not let our work take over our lives.",
		"When we think of culture, we first think of human cultures, of culture. We think of computers, airplanes, fashions, our teams, and pop stars. For most of human cultural history, none of those things existed. For hundreds of thousands of years, no human culture had a tool with moving parts. Well into the twentieth century, various human foraging cultures retained tools of stone, wood, and bone. We might pity human hunter-gatherers for their stuck simplicity, but we would be making a mistake. They held extensive knowledge, knew deep secrets of their lands and creatures. And they experienced rich and rewarding lives; we know so because when their ways were threatened, they fought to hold on to them, to the death. Sadly, this remains true as the final tribal peoples get overwhelmed by those who value money above humanity. We are living in their end times and, to varying extents, we’re all contributing to those endings. Ultimately our values may even prove self-defeating.",
		"Broad, open­-ended questions show your interest in the other person’s situation. They often start with “Tell me,” “how,” “who,” “what,” or “why.” They are much more powerful than closed questions that require a simple answer such as “yes” or “no” or a specific piece of information. After the broad question opens the conversation and begins to build rapport, the artful questioner builds on the responses and increases his understanding of the information being transferred. Our computer salesperson might have a client who says, “I need more control over our order system.” He then builds on that response by asking a question using the most important words in the answer―control and order system. For instance, he might ask, “What aspects of your order system would you like to have more control over?” or “Could you tell me more about your order system?” When the client responds, he builds his next question around the response to that question, and so on.",
		"We commonly argue about the fairness of taxation― whether this or that tax will fall more heavily on the rich or the poor. But the expressive dimension of taxation goes beyond debates about fairness, to the moral judgements societies make about which activities are worthy of honor and recognition, and which ones should be discouraged. Sometimes, these judgements are explicit. Taxes on tobacco, alcohol, and casinos are called “sin taxes” because they seek to discourage activities considered harmful or undesirable. Such taxes express society’s disapproval of these activities by raising the cost of engaging in them. Proposals to tax sugary sodas (to combat obesity) or carbon emissions (to address climate change) likewise seek to change norms and shape behavior. Not all taxes have this aim. We do not tax income to express disapproval of paid employment or to discourage people from engaging in it. Nor is a general sales tax intended as a deterrent to buying things. These are simply ways of raising revenue.",
		"Cultures of honor tend to take root in highlands and other marginally fertile areas. If you live on some rocky mountainside, you can’t farm. You probably raise goats or sheep, and the kind of culture that grows up around being a herdsman is very different from the culture that grows up around growing crops. The survival of a farmer relies on the cooperation of others in the community. But a herdsman is off by himself. Farmers also don’t have to worry that their livelihood will be stolen in the night, because crops can’t easily be stolen. But a herdsman does have to worry. He’s under constant threat of ruin through the loss of his animals. So he has to be aggressive: he has to make it clear, through his words and deeds, that he is not weak. He has to be willing to fight in response to even the slightest challenge to his reputation―and that’s what a “culture of honor” means.",
		"Psychologists Dember and Earl suggested that the motivation for exploration had its roots in a curiosity drive. They suggested that curiosity is stimulated by novelty and argued that novelty is in the eye of the beholder. We could have seen something many times before, but as the result of having new skills or competence, we discover new or different aspects of that object. This is very important for understanding why people will often return to explore things that they explored before or do things they have done before. In our daily lives, for example, we might decide to listen to a piece of music that we have listened to many times. By returning to that music with a new or fresh perspective, perhaps as a result of listening to other music, we find something new and interesting. One reason that people can play a card game such as bridge over and over is that no matter how many times you have played the game, it will be different in some way.",
		"The hunters, armed only with primitive weapons, were no real match for an angry mammoth. Many were probably killed or severely injured in the close encounters that were necessary to slay one of these gigantic animals. But the rewards were great when one was brought down. A single mammoth could feed, clothe, and supply a band for a long time. The hunters had followed the mammoths and other large animals eastward from Asia across what is now the Bering Sea. Some of them may have traveled by small boat along the coast, but many walked. Twenty thousand years ago, at the height of the last glacial period, sea level was so low that dry land joined what are now separate continents. Slowly, imperceptibly, and probably unconsciously, hunters had moved across the land bridge and become the first immigrants to the new land. Without the ice age, North America might have remained unpopulated for thousands of years more.",
		"One of the most notable examples of the collaboration of film director and composer was that of Eisenstein and Prokofiev in the making of Alexander Nevsky (1938). In the book Film Sense, Eisenstein describes how closely composer and director worked to achieve a structural harmony between picture and sound. First there were lengthy discussions about the intention and construction of each film section. Following these talks, the composer would sometimes rough out and record musical passages for a scene or sequence. The director would then film these sections and try editing them in accordance with the musical construction. At other times, a reverse procedure would be followed. Music would be written after a sequence had been shot and edited, to conform to a rough of the final picture “cut.” The aim was to relate music and picture through an identical fluidity of aural and visual structure.",
		"There was once a king who was unhappy at being overweight, so he called the wisest man in the kingdom to help him to get into shape. The wise man told him that there was a magic mirror in the king’s woods and, if one looked into it, one would become as thin as one wanted. The only problem was that this mirror could only be found in the woods early in the morning at sunrise and then only for a few minutes did its magic work. The king then proceeded to get up just before dawn every morning and run around the woods searching for this mirror. After a couple of months the wise man placed a mirror in the woods for the king to find one morning and miraculously he had lost all the weight he had wanted. Of course the mirror was not magic. The king’s weight loss was directly attributable to two months of early morning jogging. Would the king have taken the advice if he had been told to do that?",
		"Imagine that you just played “Happy Birthday” on a tuba. Next, you play it on a high-pitched violin. None of the tuba’s sounds are duplicated by the violin. Yet, we notice something interesting: The melody is still recognizable―as long as the relationship between notes remains the same. Now, what would happen if you played the notes of “Happy Birthday” in the correct order, but at a rate of one per hour? What would we have? Nothing! The separate notes would no longer be a melody. Perceptually, the melody is somehow more than the individual notes that define it. It was observations like these that launched the Gestalt school of thought. The German word Gestalt means form, pattern, or whole. Gestalt psychologists studied thinking, learning, and perception in whole units, not by analyzing experiences into parts. Their slogan was, “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.”",
		"The Earth is a somewhat irregular clock. Some years the length of the day is found to vary by as much as one part in 10 million, or three seconds in a year of 31.5 million seconds. In addition, there are also seasonal changes of a few milliseconds per year. In the winter the Earth slows down, and in the summer it speeds up. Think of the Earth as a spinning skater. During the winter in the northern hemisphere, water evaporates from the ocean and accumulates as ice and snow on the high mountains. This movement of water from the oceans to the mountaintops is similar to the skater’s extending her arms. So the Earth slows down in winter; by the summer the snow melts and runs back to the seas, and the Earth speeds up again. This effect is not compensated by the opposite effect in the southern hemisphere because most of the land mass is north of the equator.",
		"Government goods and services are, by and large, distributed to groups of individuals through the use of non-market rationing. This means that government goods and services are not made available to persons according to their willingness to pay and their use is not rationed by prices. In some cases, the services are available to all, with no direct charge and no eligibility requirements. The provision of national defense services is one strong example of a good that is freely available to all and not rationed by prices. In other cases, criteria such as income, age, residence, or the payment of certain taxes or charges are used to determine eligibility to receive benefits. For example, to receive Social Security pensions in the United States, individuals must be of a certain age, have worked for a certain period of time (about 10 years) while covered by Social Security, and must have paid their share of Social Security taxes during that time.",
		"Why do meteorologists measure temperature in the shade, rather than in the Sun? Aren’t people more interested in the temperature in the Sun? Why don’t they report it? It turns out that there is a good reason. Thermometers are supposed to measure air temperature. When you place them in a room, they eventually reach the same temperature as the air. However, if you put a thermometer in direct sunlight, the red­-colored alcohol absorbs more sunlight than does the transparent air. That makes the thermometer hotter than the air. Of course, heat will flow from the thermometer into the air, but if the Sun keeps shining on the thermometer, the thermometer will always be hotter. So a thermometer in the Sun does not measure the air temperature. On the other hand, the temperature of the air in the shade is usually the same as that in the Sun. So if you really want to know the temperature of the sunlit air, measure it in the shade.",
		"It takes time to develop and launch products. Consequently, many companies know 6—12 months ahead of time that they will be launching a new product. In order to create interest in the product, companies will often launch pre-market advertising campaigns. In the nutrition industry, articles are often written discussing a new nutrient under investigation. Over a series of issues, you begin to see more articles discussing this new nutrient and potential to enhance training and/or performance. Then, after 4—6 months, a new product is coincidentally launched that contains the ingredient that has been discussed in previous issues. Books and supplement reviews have also been used as vehicles to promote the sale of fitness and nutrition products. This marketing technique is called demand creation. It involves creating a buzz about a new potentially revolutionary nutrient or training technique through publishing articles and/or books that stimulate the reader’s interest. Once this is done, a new product is launched.",
		"There’s a direct counterpart to pop music in the classical song, more commonly called an “art song,” which does not focus on the development of melodic material. Both the pop song and the art song tend to follow tried-and-true structural patterns. And both will be published in the same way―with a vocal line and a basic piano part written out underneath. But the pop song will rarely be sung and played exactly as written; the singer is apt to embellish that vocal line to give it a “styling,” just as the accompanist will fill out the piano part to make it more interesting and personal. The performers might change the original tempo and mood completely. You won’t find such extremes of approach by the performers of songs by Franz Schubert or Richard Strauss. These will be performed note for note because both the vocal and piano parts have been painstakingly written down by the composer with an ear for how each relates to the other.",
		"It is possible to measure how far away from us each galaxy is. How? How, for that matter, do we know how far away anything in the universe is? For nearby stars the best method uses something called ‘parallax’. Hold your finger up in front of your face and look at it with your left eye closed. Now open your left eye and close your right. Keep switching eyes, and you’ll notice that the apparent position of your finger hops from side to side. That is because of the difference between the viewpoints of your two eyes. Move your finger nearer, and the hops will become greater. Move your finger farther away and the hops become smaller. All you need to know is how far apart your eyes are, and you can calculate the distance from eyes to finger by the size of the hops. That is the parallax method of estimating distances.",
		"A set of problems in social science centers on the limitations and design of social science research. It is not really possible to conduct some forms of controlled experiments on human beings. For example, we cannot deliberately subject people to poverty and deprivation in order to make the necessary observations about causes of violence. In a laboratory, we can control all or most of the factors that go into the experimental situation. But in real­-world observations, we cannot control many factors; this makes it difficult to pinpoint what it is that causes the behavior that we are studying. Moreover, even where some experimentation is permitted, human beings frequently modify their behavior simply because they know they are being observed in a social science experiment. This phenomenon, known as the Hawthorne effect, makes it difficult to determine whether the observed behavior is a product of the stimulus being introduced or merely a product of the experimental situation itself.",
		"It has been said that eye movements are windows into the mind, because where people look reveals what environmental information they are attending to. However, there is more to attention than just moving the eyes to look at objects. We can pay attention to things that are not directly in our line of vision, as evidenced by the basketball player who dribbles down court while paying attention to a teammate off to the side, just before she throws a perfect pass without looking. We can also look directly at something without paying attention to it. You may have had this experience if you have been reading a book and then suddenly become aware that although you were moving your eyes across the page and “reading” the words, you had no idea what you had just read. Even though you were looking at the words, you apparently were not paying attention. There is a mental aspect of attention that involves processing that can occur independently of eye movements.",
		"Today the term artist is used to refer to a broad range of creative individuals across the globe from both past and present. This rather general usage erroneously suggests that the concept or word “artist” existed in original contexts. In contrast to the diversity it is applied to, the meaning of this term continues to be mostly based on Western views and values. Since the fifteenth century, this tradition has been concerned with recognizing individual achievements. Inventions, ideas, and discoveries have been credited to the persons who originated them. This view is also at the core of the definition of an “artist.” Artists are perceived to establish a strong bond with their art to the point of combining into one “entity.” Art history has reinforced this oneness: A painting by Pablo Picasso is called “a Picasso.” This union between artists and their work has determined the essential qualities of an artist: originality, authorship, and authenticity.",
		"The evolution in the West from the late seventeenth century onwards of the idea of the aesthetic in music produced musical forms which were specifically intended to be listened to by a knowledgeable public and performed only by experts and masters. That is, specially trained musicians performed and the audience was expected to contemplate the musical aesthetic as they listened. It is from this tradition that the instrumental and vocal forms of modern western music have evolved. In addition to such events, there was also communal music­-making, especially at festivals such as the Winter Solstice, Harvest time, Spring time, and other secular celebrations where everyone participated. Music in the Christian church is similarly organised with communally sung hymns, anthems, and other liturgical items sung by the specially trained choir. To this extent, it can be claimed that most cultures, if not all of them, have both communal music­-making where everyone participates and where the notion of musical talent is irrelevant, and special ritual and ceremonial music where only the specially talented and trained perform, and where the rest listen and participate as observers.",
		"The force of gravity is always attractive. It is a force pulling together any two things that have mass. Any amount of mass will cause the attraction, but the more mass the stronger the force. That’s why a brick is heavier than a balloon, heavier and harder to hold or move in opposition to the force of gravity. The force also depends on the distance between the objects: the greater the distance the weaker the force. The attraction gets weaker and weaker as the objects get further apart, but it never disappears altogether. The force never goes to zero. And it never pushes things away. That’s because objects always have a positive amount of mass. There is no such thing as negative mass. It’s not like electric charge that comes in both positive and negative values.",
		"Although every forensic case is different, each case goes through many of the same phases. Each phase requires its own procedures and expertise. Throughout each phase, the chain of evidence must remain intact. The first phase is usually the discovery of the case. More likely than not, discovery is made by accident. The second phase is recovery of the remains and evidence. This and future phases require professional help. Next, laboratory analysis and research on the remains and evidence proceed. At some point, all of the data from the different labs and investigators comes together and is synthesized into the case report. Although changes may be made, this synthesis is the formal interpretation of the data and provides the most logical explanation or reconstruction of the events and the identification of the remains.",
		"In each life, there are many important pieces that make up the whole. They can be thought of like pie slices. Each slice represents an important part of the self. There will be universal slices in each person’s pie, and there will also be slices unique to that specific individual’s personality. Some fairly universal slices may include health/well­being, home, family, work, finances, and relationships. Unique slices of the self can include hobbies, spirituality, and education. Each slice of the self impacts the others. For example, if there is difficulty with work, the family, finances, and mental health will likely be impacted in a negative manner. Conversely, if an individual has employment that is fulfilling and rewarding, this will positively impact other pieces of the self.",
		"Carlos Sanchez’s long­time friend, Frank Sandoval, had fallen on hard times and was about to lose his home. Frank’s wife was sick and their two small children were temporarily staying with his mother. Carlos hadn’t talked to Frank for several months and decided one day to call him and see how he was. When Frank confided in Carlos about his situation, Carlos immediately went to Frank’s home. When he walked in, he was shocked to see his friend so thin and frail. He sat down with Frank and asked him how much money he needed. Frank told him it was hopeless, that it was too much to pay back. Carlos pulled out his checkbook and wrote him a check for fifty thousand dollars. He told Frank that things would get better ―and they did. Three years later, Frank paid Carlos back with interest.",
		"“I found my baby sister!” I proudly said, pushing a stroller around so that my mother could see the newest member of our family whom I had just taken. At that time I was not quite three years old, and the toddler was only a few months younger than that, with her hair tied tightly behind her little head. I remember that she was smiling up at me. I must have taken her smile as permission to take the unwatched stroller. “No, you haven’t!” my mother gasped in shock, putting a hand over her own mouth. The child was quickly returned to her worried mother, despite my tearful protests.",
		"Grandfather had worked hard building an ice rink on the lake. He had spread the snow, watered the ice, and made it smooth. “Now,” said Grandfather, setting Tommy down on a wooden chair to explain things to him. “The first thing you will do is to hold onto the wooden chair and try to skate with it.” “Okay,” said Tommy, taking a hold of the back of the chair. It was a little difficult at first and he did end up falling a few times. However, he learned pretty quickly. “I think you are ready to try to skate without the chair,” said Grandfather. He walked backward on the ice, at first holding Tommy’s hands, but then he let go and Tommy moved toward him. Soon, Tommy was skating all by himself. Grandfather was so proud of him.",
		"Leaving a store, I returned to my car only to find that I’d locked my car key and cell phone inside the vehicle. A teenager riding his bike saw me kick a tire in frustration. “What’s wrong?” he asked. I explained my situation. “But even if I could call my husband,” I said, “he can’t bring me his car key, since this is our only car.” He handed me his cell phone. The thoughtful boy said, “Call your husband and tell him I’m coming to get his key.” “Are you sure? That’s four miles round trip.” “Don’t worry about it.” An hour later, he returned with the key. I offered him some money, but he refused. “Let’s just say I needed the exercise,” he said. Then, like a cowboy in the movies, he rode off into the sunset.",
		"Albert Einstein once boarded a train from Philadelphia. The conductor came around to punch the tickets and said, “Ticket, please.” Einstein reached into his vest pocket for the ticket, but did not find it. He checked his jacket pocket. No ticket. He checked his brief case. But still, he could not find his ticket. The conductor, noting his obvious distress, kindly said, “I know who you are, Dr. Einstein. Don’t worry about your ticket.” Several minutes later the conductor turned around from the front of the traincar to see Einstein continuing to search under his seat for the missing ticket. Quickly, he hurried back to assure the gray-haired gentleman. “Dr. Einstein, Dr. Einstein, I know who you are!” he repeated. “Please don’t worry about your ticket.” Dr. Einstein slowly arose from his knees and addressed the young conductor. “Son, you don’t understand. I, too, know who I am. What I don’t know is where I’m going.”",
		"The CEO of a large company stepped out of a big black limousine. As usual, he walked up the stairs to the main entrance. He was just about to step through the large glass doors when he heard a voice say, “I’m very sorry, sir, but I cannot let you in without ID.” The security guard, who had worked for the company for many years, looked his boss straight in the eyes, showing no sign of emotion on his face. The CEO was speechless. He felt his pockets to no avail. He had probably left his ID at home. He took another look at the motionless security guard, and scratched his chin, thinking. Then he turned on his heels and went back to his limousine. The security guard was left standing, not knowing that by this time tomorrow, he was going to be promoted to head of security.",
		"An elderly carpenter was ready to retire. He told his boss of his plans to leave the house­building business to live a more leisurely life with his family. He would miss the paycheck each week, but he wanted to retire. The boss was sorry to see his good worker go and asked if he could build just one more house as a personal favor. The carpenter said yes, but over time it was easy to see that his heart was not in his work. He used poor materials and didn’t put much time or effort into his last work. It was an unfortunate way to end his lifelong career. When he finished his work, his boss came to check out the house. Then he handed the front­door key to the worker and said, “This is your house, my gift to you.”",
		"One time I was at my grandpa Cassil’s farm when he was going to pick up a new beagle puppy. My cousin and I went with him to get the puppy, and on the way back to the house, we started talking about what to name him. Grandpa said that we could call him anything we wanted, so we decided to name that dog Blaze. Blaze turned out to be a pretty good dog, and he and I got to be good friends as we grew up. I looked forward to going to Grandpa’s each week to see Blaze and run around the farm with him. But one Sunday we went to Grandpa’s, and he was gone. Grandpa said a friend of his had liked the dog, and he had given him away. I never saw Blaze again, and I missed him a lot.",
		"Meghan Vogel was tired. She had just won the 2012 state championship in the 1,600­meter race. She was so exhausted afterward that she was in last place toward the end of her next race, the 3,200 meters. As she came around the final turn in the long race, the runner in front of her, Arden McMath, fell to the ground. Vogel made a quick decision. She stopped and helped McMath to her feet. Together, they walked the last 30 meters. Vogel guided her to the finish line. And then she gave McMath a gentle push across it, just ahead of Vogel herself. “If you work hard to get to the state meet, you deserve to finish,” she said. Later, Vogel’s hometown held a parade in her honor. It wasn’t because of the race where she finished first. It was because of the race where she finished last.",
		"When Mom decided to marry Dad, her father didn’t like him. Dad was a painter from a poor family and he had no background to speak of. The important thing, Mom has told me, is that she knew she and he were soul mates. Nothing was going to stop her from spending the rest of her life with him. So they got married and settled in Millerton, and my grandfather decided he could put up with Dad. When Dad couldn’t quite make a living with his paintings, he and Mom bought an old house on Grant Avenue and turned it into a boarding house.",
		"About fifty years ago, a Pygmy named Kenge took his first trip out of the forests of Africa and onto the open plains with an anthropologist. Buffalo appeared in the distance, and the Pygmy watched them curiously. Finally, he turned to the anthropologist and asked what kind of insects they were. “When I told Kenge that the insects were buffalo, he roared with laughter and told me not to tell such stupid lies.” The anthropologist wasn’t stupid, and he hadn’t lied. Rather, because Kenge had lived his entire life in a dense jungle that offered no views of the horizon, he had failed to learn what most of us take for granted, namely, that things look different when they are far away.",
		"When Angela was young, she was always disappointed about her performance despite her efforts. Whenever she felt down, her mom encouraged her by saying that working hard and never giving up is more important. With her mother’s encouragement, she remained positive and tried to do her best. Many years later, Angela was awarded a New Directions Fellowship, given to most promising young researchers. The award was for her research on the importance of passion and persistence. She wanted to share her achievement with her mom and express her gratitude. Angela read her research paper to her mom. Her mom was over 80, and she read a bit slower ensuring her mom understood clearly. Still, she seemed to be listening intently, and when Angela was done, she nodded and then smiled. “It turns out you were right, mom.” Angela said.",
		"Serene tried to do a pirouette in front of her mother but fell to the floor. Serene’s mother helped her off the floor. She told her that she had to keep trying if she wanted to succeed. However, Serene was almost in tears. She had been practicing very hard the past week but she did not seem to improve. Serene’s mother said that she herself had tried many times before succeeding at Serene’s age. She had fallen so often that she sprained her ankle and had to rest for three months before she was allowed to dance again. Serene was surprised. Her mother was a famous ballerina and to Serene, her mother had never fallen or made a mistake in any of her performances. Listening to her mother made her realize that she had to put in more effort than what she had been doing so far.",
		"“Wanna work together?” a cheerful voice spoke on Amy’s first day at a new school. It was Wilhemina. Amy was too surprised to do anything but nod. The big black girl put her notebook down beside Amy’s. After dropping the notebook, she lifted herself up onto the stool beside Amy. “I’m Wilhemina Smiths, Smiths with an s at both ends,” she said with a friendly smile. “My friends call me Mina. You’re Amy Tillerman.” Amy nodded and stared. As the only new kid in the school, she was pleased to have a lab partner. But Amy wondered if Mina chose her because she had felt sorry for the new kid.",
		"A 17-­year-­old patient sat in my counseling office some time ago and said, “I’m so tired of my father telling me that I don’t live up to my potential. He says it about once a month.” This young man is a typical product of a high­achieving father. His father is a physician who has a terrible time with both his employees and his children because he expects the same sort of drive in everyone else. He is trying to inspire his son, but the result is defiance. Here is why. If the father says, “You have great potential,” it is a compliment to his talent, but it is quickly spoiled with the remark, “You don’t live up to your potential.” In the process he has attacked his son’s character.",
		"Two brothers were convicted of stealing sheep. They each were branded on the forehead with the letters ST for “sheep thief.” One brother was so embarrassed by this branding that he ran away; he was never heard from again. The other brother, filled with regret, chose to stay in the village and try to make amends for his offenses. Whenever there was work needing to be done, the sheep thief came to help with a lending hand. Never accepting pay for his good deeds, he lived his life for others. Many years later, a traveler came through the village. Sitting at a sidewalk cafe, the traveler saw an old man with a strange brand on his forehead seated nearby. He noticed that all the villagers who passed the man stopped to share a kind word or to pay their respects. Curious, the stranger asked a resident of the village what the letters stood for. The villager replied, “I don’t know. It happened so long ago...... but I think it stands for ‘saint.’”",
		"Patrick’s neighbor had played the part of Santa Claus for several years, creating a tradition of a visit from Santa to all the children in the neighborhood. But one year, Santa had a cold and asked whether Patrick could take over for him that day. Instead of the neighbor, he wore the suit and passed out candy canes to all the neighborhood children, convincing them he was for real. “When I put on the suit, I actually felt like Santa Claus,” Patrick says. When the old Santa saw how much Patrick enjoyed the job, he told Patrick he would be happy to let him take over. Patrick has been playing Santa for so long now that he is beginning to see the children of the children he saw as Santa when he first started out. But Patrick has no plans to find a new man for the suit. “Santa never retires,” he says.",
		"When my daughter, Isabella, was five years old, we were living in Washington, D.C. One day, we were volunteering at Children of Mine, a center for children in need. The day before, we had celebrated her fifth birthday with a cake, presents, balloons, and a birthday party. By chance, at the center that day there was a little girl also having her fifth birthday. Her entire birthday celebration consisted of a chocolate chip cookie with a candle. I remember watching my daughter from across the room, her eyes welling with tears. Something clicked for her, something that I could not have taught her. When we returned home, Isabella rushed to her room, collected all the presents she had got for her birthday, and told me that she wanted to take them to the little girl. Now it’s not as if Isabella was suddenly transformed into Mother Teresa―she has had many moments of selfishness since then. But it was a profound moment, whose impact will always be with her.",
		"Jesse’s best friend Monica, a mother of three, was diagnosed with a rare disease. Unfortunately, she didn’t have the money necessary to start her treatment and pay for all the other expenses related to her disease. So Jesse jumped in to help her. She reached out to friends and family and asked them if they could spare $100. If so, they were to bring their contribution to a restaurant downtown at a designated time. Her goal was to get 100 people to give $100. Under false pretenses, Jesse took Monica to the restaurant and asked if she minded answering a few questions on video to share with others about her sickness. She agreed. Soon after the video began, a line formed outside the restaurant. The number grew to hundreds of people, each delivering a $100 bill. The kindness and generosity shown by both friends and strangers made a huge difference for Monica and her family.",
		"Jake’s own flying dream began at a village festival. He was four years old. His uncle, a tall silent pilot, had bought him a red party balloon from a charity stall, and tied it to the top button of Jake’s shirt. The balloon seemed to have a mind of its own. It was filled with helium, a gas four times lighter than air, though Jake did not understand this at the time. It pulled mysteriously at his button. “Maybe you will fly,” Jake’s uncle remarked. He led his nephew up a grassy bank so they could look over the whole festival. Below Jake stretched the little tents and the stalls. Above him bobbed the big red balloon, shiny and beautiful. It kept pulling him towards the sky, and he began to feel unsteady on his feet. Then his uncle let go of his hand, and Jake’s dream began.",
		"One day, Jane was walking from class across campus to catch her bus home, with her head down, fighting tears of total despair, when a woman came down the sidewalk toward her. Jane had never seen her before. Embarrassed at being seen in such an emotional mess, she turned her head away and hoped to hurry past. But the woman moved directly in front of Jane, waited until she looked up, and then smiled. Looking into her eyes, the woman spoke in a quiet voice, “Whatever is wrong will pass. You’re going to be OK. Just hang on.” She then smiled again and walked away. Jane can’t explain the impact of that moment, of the woman’s unexpected kindness and unconditional caring! The woman gave her the one thing she’d lost completely: hope. Jane looked for her on campus to thank her but never saw her again.",
		"On a spring day in New York’s Central Park, a balloon salesman was busy trying to sell his balloons. In order to gain the attention of those walking in the park, from time to time he would release a brightly colored balloon and let it rise into the sky. In the sunny afternoon, a little African-American boy approached him. The boy was shy and had a poor self-image. He had been watching the man and had a question for him. “Mister, if you let a black balloon go, will it rise too?” The balloon salesman knew what he was asking. “Sweetheart,” he explained. “It doesn’t matter what color the balloon is. It’s not what’s on the outside that makes it rise; it’s what’s on the inside that makes it go up.”",
		"When I was young, I played a game, power of observation, with my father. At first, I was terrible, but I’d get better. After 20 minutes, I felt like I was taking snapshots with my mind. He taught me that memory, or at least observation, is a muscle. I’ve been flexing it every day since then, or at least trying to. Whenever I miss him, I play the same game with my own son, who’s named after my father, Solomon. He is better at it than I was. He is nearly ten years old, the age I was when my father died. I doubt this Solomon will grow up to be a writer. But it comforts me to know that whatever he does, he’ll go forth in the world with something handed down from my father even though he wasn’t around to give it to Solomon directly. He was a truly good man, and a good father even if he just didn’t have the longevity that I hoped.",
		"The running boy was way ahead of him, but Roy figured he could stay close enough to keep him in sight. He knew the kid couldn’t go at full speed forever. He followed him for several blocks―over fences, through shrubbery, weaving through barking dogs and lawn sprinklers. Eventually Roy felt himself tiring. This kid is amazing, he thought. Maybe he’s practicing for the track team. Once Roy thought he saw the boy glance over his shoulder, as if he knew he was being pursued, but Roy couldn’t be certain. The boy was still far ahead of him, and Roy was gulping like a beached trout. His shirt was soaked and sweat poured off his forehead, stinging his eyes.",
		"Paul is a tall freckled six­year­old with poor eyesight. One day, his father sends him on a children’s tour of the museum where he works. The guide is a gray­haired old man. He taps the tip of his cane against the floor for attention. Paul watches engineers use pulleys to lift a fossilized dinosaur. He also sees a stuffed giraffe in a closet and peers into drawers full of feathers and glass eyeballs. The guide shows him rare objects from Brazil and a meteorite in a glass case that he claims is as ancient as the solar system itself. After leading Paul down two twisting staircases and along several corridors, he stops outside an iron door with a single keyhole. “End of tour. This is the way out,” he says.",
		"A lovely little girl was holding two apples with both hands. Her mom came in and softly asked her little daughter with a smile, “My sweetie, could you give your mom one of your two apples?” The girl looked up at her for some seconds. Then she suddenly took a quick bite of one apple, and then quickly of the other. Although the mom felt the smile on her face freeze, she tried hard not to reveal her disappointment. Then the little girl handed one of her bitten apples to her, and said, “Mommy, here you are. This is the sweeter one.” There, she realized no matter who you are, how experienced you are, and how knowledgeable you think you are, you should always delay judgment.",
		"Three teens slipped into their sleeping bags and zipped them up. A few hours later John woke up and was thirsty. Paul was still furiously snoring as he got up and went to find his water bottle in the dark. He stumbled on Bill’s sleeping bag, but it didn’t feel right to him. “Bill,” he called quietly. No answer. John bent over to feel his friend in the sleeping bag, but he couldn’t find him. He found the lantern and switched it on. Bill was not in his sleeping bag. “Paul,” he called loudly. “Paul,” he shouted again. “What do you want?” Paul said very sleepily. “Bill’s gone. Get up and help me find him. He said he couldn’t sleep with your snoring,” said John. “It’s not morning yet,” Paul mumbled. Then he gradually sat up in his bag. “Where is he?” Paul asked. “I don’t know. That’s why we have to go look for him.” John was visibly worried.",
		"Henri Matisse and Auguste Renoir were dear friends and frequent companions. When Renoir was confined to his home during the last decade of his life, Matisse visited him daily. Renoir, almost paralyzed by arthritis, continued to paint in spite of his illness. One day, as Matisse watched the painter working in his studio, fighting torturous pain with each brush stroke, he said abruptly: “Why do you continue to paint when you are in such agony?” Renoir answered simply: “The beauty remains; the pain passes.” And so, almost to his dying day, Renoir put paint to canvas. One of his most famous paintings, The Bathers, was completed just two years before his passing, 14 years after he was stricken by the disabling disease.",
		"Jack stopped the cycle of perfectionism that his son Mark was developing. Mark could not stand to lose at games by the time he was eight years old. Jack was contributing to Mark’s attitude by always letting him win at chess because he didn’t like to see Mark get upset and cry. One day, Jack realized it was more important to allow Mark some experience with losing, so he started winning at least half the games. Mark was upset at first, but soon began to win and lose with more grace. Jack felt a milestone had been reached one day when he was playing catch with Mark and threw a bad ball. Instead of getting upset about missing the ball, Mark was able to use his sense of humor and commented, “Nice throw, Dad. Lousy catch, Mark.”",
		"The nurse showed Lina an opening in the side of the incubator. Lina slipped her hand in and touched her daughter’s hand. She lightly rubbed the baby’s wrist and fingers. Then she turned to the nurse as tears streamed down her cheeks. “When can I hold her?” asked Lina. “Probably later today. After the doctor checks her,” said the nurse. “It is important that you bond with her. The more you are around her, the better it will be for the baby.” Lina wiped the tears from her cheeks with the back of her free hand. “You don’t have to worry, my little darling,” Lina whispered. “I’m going to be right here with you. I can hardly wait to take you home.” To her surprise, the baby opened her eyes and grasped Lina’s finger. A surge of joy shot through her.",
		"Loneliness can creep into your life as you get older, which is why it’s nice to find some ways to not be lonely. Patrick Arbore knows this, and it’s why he values meaningful conversation. Director and founder of Elderly Suicide Prevention, Arbore, founded the Friendship Line, a 24­hour hotline whose volunteers reach out to potentially suicidal seniors. He says, “What brings me joy is when I can be the listener when someone is hungry for connection.” Arbore remembers one man in particular who was feeling suicidal in his 70’s after his wife’s death. The man spoke with him on the Friendship Line at a stage when he wanted to end his life. After some time he said to him “I am no longer thinking about suicide because people care about me.” Arbore found this exchange profound. “All we did was express caring,” he says. “Our work is really quite simple. It’s connection and care.”",
		"On his march through Asia Minor, Alexander the Great fell dangerously ill. His physicians were afraid to treat him because if they didn’t succeed, the army would blame them. Only one, Philip, was willing to take the risk, as he had confidence in the king’s friendship and his own drugs. While the medicine was being prepared, Alexander received a letter accusing the physician of having been bribed to poison his master. Alexander read the letter without showing it to anyone. When Philip entered the tent with the medicine, Alexander took the cup from him, handing Philip the letter. While the physician was reading it, Alexander calmly drank the contents of the cup. Horrified, Philip threw himself down at the king’s bedside, but Alexander assured him that he had complete confidence in his honor. After three days, the king was well enough to appear again before his army.",
		"A father took his son to the circus. Before the show started, (1)he took his son to see the animals in their respective cages all except for the elephant that was tied with a rope. Holding his fathers hand, the little boy turned to (2)him and said, Dad, this elephant is so big and strong. He can kick the rope and run away. Why doesnt he? No matter how hard he tried to think of an intelligent answer, the father didnt have a good one to give his son. So, he suggested to his son that he go ask the question to the elephant trainer. When the boy saw the trainer passing by, he asked why the beast didnt try to escape. The trainer said, When this elephant was a baby, we tied the same rope to his foot and the tree. The elephant couldnt break free, and over time, he simply accepted the rope as a way of life.",
		"Mr. Aryeh noticed a young boy coming to school in old worn-out shoes. Clearly he needed a new pair, but Mr. Aryeh also knew that the boy’s father, a proud man, would be humiliated and offended if his son were treated as a charity case and given a pair. How does a person with moral imagination provide a boy with shoes, while not paining his father’s soul? During a morning recess break, Mr. Aryeh called the boy to his office because, he said, he needed to test him on his English proficiency. He asked the boy several questions, well within the youth’s grasp. “Wonderful!” Mr. Aryeh said when the boy answered correctly. He gave the youngster two notes: one to be brought to a local shoemaker, with instructions to give the boy a good pair of shoes, for which Mr. Aryeh would pay; the second, a note to the boy’s father telling him about the “prize” his son had won.",
		"The cottage of a poor man named Nicholas happened to stand in a place which was overgrown with wild bushes. He lay down under the shade of a hazel tree upon a hot day, about the time of harvest. A farmer passed close by him with a cart heavily loaded with corn. With envious eyes Nicholas looked at the cart full of corn, and barely said “Good morning” to the farmer. He, however, stopped, and said to Nicholas, “If from this land, which is your property, you would cultivate daily as many feet as you cover with your lazy body, you would reap every year much more corn than you see upon the cart here.” Nicholas paid attention to this advice. He rooted up bushes, and worked upon the soil. It cost Nicholas not a single penny, and placed him and his family in affluent circumstances.",
		"Dave Butcher, director of training for Sea World in Florida, showed me more than I’d imagined possible. His sea lions worked for social rewards as well as fish. Consequently, he did not have to keep his sea lions hungry in order to make them perform. During and after the day’s performances, the sea lions could have all the fish they wanted. One result was that they were not irritable, as any hungry animal might be. The sea lions were friendly to those humans they knew and enjoyed being with them. I was surprised to see trainers on their lunch hour sunbathing in a pile with their sea lions. Another result of stopping food deprivation was that these sea lions grew and grew! In fact, they became bigger than most trained sea lions in the past, which weren’t given enough food.",
		"A friend of mine mentioned last week that he once bought a Frankies chicken and he discovered after getting home that it was all dry and nasty. He took it back to the store and got an immediate refund. Then he decided to write to Walter Robinson, the CEO of Frankies Chickens, and tell him that he had bought one of his quality chickens and it was all dry and nasty. By return mail he got a letter from Walter that not only included lengthy apologies and a certificate for a free chicken, but that also asked for his help to make sure it never happened again by asking a whole list of specific questions: Where did he buy it? When? Exactly what was wrong? What did he think had happened? What exactly did the store say when he returned it? Two days later an executive of Frankies Chickens called to make sure he had received the letter, to make sure that all was well, and to ask some more specific questions. My friend will never buy anything but Frankies chicken.",
		"Born in Budapest to a family of bankers, von Neumann was undeniably bright. At age eight, he had mastered calculus. At age twelve, he was reading works aimed at professional mathematicians. But he also loved to invent mechanical toys and became a child expert on Byzantine history. When it was time to go off to university, he agreed to study chemical engineering as a compromise with his father, who feared that his son couldn’t make a living as a mathematician. Von Neumann kept his bargain by enrolling at the University of Budapest and promptly leaving for Berlin, where he spent his time doing mathematics, and returning to Budapest at the end of every semester to take examinations. He published his second mathematics paper, in which he gave the modern definition of ordinal numbers, at age nineteen. By age twenty-five he had published ten major papers; by age thirty, nearly three dozen.",
		"Benny Tee was one of my very good friends. He ran a retail shoe store near my house. Two weeks before Christmas a poor man walked into Benny’s store. Looking around at all the shoes, he asked, “Are you Mr. Tee?” and Benny said, “Yes.” “I want a special pair of shoes for my son.” Standing next to him was an eleven­year­old boy dressed in shabby clothes. Benny looked down at the boy’s feet and saw that he had club feet. His father explained, “The one thing my son wants for Christmas is a pair of shoes like the other kids. Could you make them for him?” Benny said, “Yes, but it will take time to order a special kind of leather to make shoes for him. I can’t promise they’ll be done by Christmas.” The leather didn’t come until the 24th. It took Benny until 4:00 in the morning of Christmas Day to complete his work. But when he kindly delivered the special pair of shoes to the boy’s home, Benny Tee received the best Christmas gift of his life. He received Joy.",
		"Igor Cerc went to a store to have a clock engraved. It was a gift he was taking to a wedding the day he was picking it up. However, when he arrived at the store, he found that the technician had broken the glass of the clock during the engraving process. They offered to replace the entire clock, after they got money from their insurance company, but Igor needed the clock now. He realized that it would not serve his goals to get upset. He calmly said that he needed to go to a wedding in thirty minutes; the clock was his wedding gift. He noted that there was similar glass in other clocks in the store. Couldn’t the store take apart another clock to fix his? He was calm and polite throughout. “The clerk thanked me for not yelling at him as other customers do,” said Igor. “I realized that he would do everything he could for me as long as I remained polite.” The clerk took apart another clock and quickly replaced the glass, and Igor went on his way.",
		"One day a wise old monk heard an impatient pounding on the door. He opened it and greeted a young man, who said, “I have studied with great and wise masters. However, just in case there is anything more I need to know, I have come to see if you can add to my knowledge.” “Very well,” said the monk. “Come and have tea, and we will discuss your studies.” When the tea was ready, the old man began to pour it into the visitor’s cup. When the cup was full, he continued pouring until the tea spilled over the side of the cup. The startled man jumped back and shouted, “You’re a fool who does not even know when a cup is full!” The wise man calmly replied, “Just like this cup, your mind is so full of ideas that there is no room for any more. Come to me with an empty-cup mind, and then you will learn something.”",
		"Ellie walked to school in her new shoes. “I like those,” Megan whispered. “Cool.” Ellie felt happy. She knew it was hard to get compliments from Megan and couldn’t hide her smile. The two friends had desks side by side at the back. “Stop talking, you two,” said Miss Smith. “Bring your books to me if you’ve finished.” Ellie followed Megan to the front of the class. She always let Megan go first. She felt scared when Miss Smith was upset. Miss Smith noticed her new shoes. “Those aren’t suitable for school,” she said, her voice cold. Ellie took a deep breath. “The shop didn’t have black shoes, Miss Smith,” she said. Her voice came out in a whisper. “The school uniform requires black or dark blue shoes,” said Miss Smith. “Report to me in proper shoes, please. On Monday.” She used her quiet-shout voice and Ellie shivered.",
		"According to Dr. Paul Ekman, a pioneer of lying research at UC San Francisco, here is an example of how difficult it is for children to grasp the qualifying role of intent in telling a lie. On the way home from school on Tuesday, a dad promises his five‒year‒old son that he will take him to the baseball game on Saturday afternoon. When they get home, Dad learns from Mom that earlier in the day she had scheduled a swim lesson for Saturday afternoon and can’t change it. When they tell their son, he gets terribly upset, and the situation melts down. Why is the kid so upset? Dad didn’t know about the swim lesson. By the adult definition, he did not lie. But by the kid definition, he did lie. Any false statement―regardless of intent or belief―is a lie. Therefore, unwittingly, Dad has given his child the message that he approves of breaking promises.",
		"Dad just laughed and walked out of the room still holding Slade in his arms. He had dressed him and now he put him in his chair. As Slade sat in his chair eating a biscuit that Dad had spread with butter and homemade strawberry jam, Mom walked into the kitchen. She took one look at her little boy and started laughing; his little face and hands were covered with biscuit and jam. She thought how really cute he was. “Honey, what have you done? Look at him. I will never get him clean again. I guess when he gets through eating you can take him out and dump him in the bathtub.” Dad laughed. Slade giggled and tried to spit biscuit all over Dad. It didn’t hit him because luckily he avoided the spray. That made Mom laugh even more and soon the little cabin was full of love and laughter.",
		"Grandma put her things down on the sand and walked over to Phoebe on the shore by the water. Schools of minnows were everywhere in the crystal clear water. Phoebe was going crazy watching the minnows. She said, “Grandma, I want to catch a fish.” When she handed Phoebe the very small net, Phoebe immediately tried to scoop up the minnows. It took Phoebe less than ten minutes, and even that was too long, for Phoebe to catch her first minnow. After many frustrating attempts, she finally screeched with joy and ran to Grandma sitting on her beach towel. “Grandma, look, I caught a fish!” Phoebe gave the minnow to Grandma, which she kept for Phoebe in a clear, plastic container as a souvenir of Phoebe catching her first fish.",
		"While working at the cash register in a shop, a young college student saw an elderly couple come in with their granddaughter in a wheelchair. The cashier looked closely at the child; she had no arms or legs. As the couple wheeled her up to the counter, the college student turned her head toward the girl and gave her a wink. As she took the money from the child’s grandparents, she looked back at the girl, who gave her a beaming smile. All of a sudden the child’s disability was gone and all the young student saw was this beautiful girl; her smile was breathtaking and gave the college student a completely new sense of life. She took the young cashier from being an unhappy college student into her world of smiles, love, and warmth. Several years later as a successful business person, the once unhappy college student remembered the remarkable lesson about life that the child taught her that day.",
		"In the summer of 1972, the actor Anthony Hopkins was signed to play a leading role in a film based on George Feifer’s novel The Girl from Petrovka. That is why he traveled to London to buy a copy of the book. Unfortunately, none of the main London bookstores had a copy. Then, on his way home, waiting for an underground train at Leicester Square tube station, he saw a discarded book lying on the seat next to him. It was a copy of The Girl from Petrovka. As if that was not coincidence enough, more was to follow. Later, when he had a chance to meet the author, Hopkins told him about this strange occurrence. Feifer was interested. He said to him that in November 1971 he had lent a friend a copy of the book—a unique copy in which he had made notes on turning the British English into American English for the publication of an American version—but his friend had lost the copy in London. A quick check of the copy Hopkins had found showed that it was the very same copy that his friend had mislaid.",
		"There was a knock on the door. “Come in!” said Jack. The man who entered was young, well­groomed, and trimly dressed, with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella, which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come. He looked around anxiously in the glare of the lamp. Jack could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety. “I owe you an apology. I fear that I have brought some traces of storm and rain into your room,” the man said, raising his golden glasses to his eyes. Jack took the man’s coat and umbrella. “Your coat may rest here on the hook and will be dry shortly,” he said.",
		"Harumi Tanaka, from Osaka, Japan, had accepted an assignment in Boston. His task was to explore the possibility of developing joint ventures with American firms. He had been invited by one company to spend a month there and had been assigned an office and a research assistant. Harumi agreed on a Monday to present a business plan the following Friday. On Tuesday, the computers in the company crashed, and the research assistant called in sick with a severe case of the flu. Still, Harumi pushed forward and presented his plan on Friday. He began his presentation, “I’m sorry that I am not well prepared. This meeting may not be a good use of your time.” He then went into a clear, interesting presentation. After the meeting, one of the American executives said, “I don’t know why you had to apologize. Everyone knows about the computer crash and your assistant’s illness.” Harumi responded that he thought that the apology would be a good introduction to his presentation.",
		"J. K. Rowling, the author of the famous Harry Potter series, has personally corresponded with several dying children who were fans of her books and with the parents of children who have died. For example, in January 2000, she sent an e­mail to Catie Hoch, an eight­year­old girl suffering from cancer, who she had heard about. Catie loved Harry Potter, and Rowling began a correspondence with her, telling her secrets about the fourth book that she was writing. When Rowling heard that cancer had spread to Catie’s brain, one month after her ninth birthday, and that she only had a few weeks left to live, Rowling began calling Catie, and reading her the yet unpublished Book 4 over the phone. Three days after Catie died, Rowling wrote to tell Catie’s parents that she felt privileged to have had contact with Catie. When Catie’s parents established the Catie Hoch Foundation to help young cancer patients, Rowling contributed to it.",
		"Mrs. Smith, an intelligent woman in her sixties, has suffered a massive stroke, affecting the back portions of her right cerebral hemisphere. She has perfectly preserved intelligence―and humor. She sometimes complains to her nurse that she has not put dessert or coffee on her tray. When the nurse says, “But, it is right there, on the left,” Mrs. Smith does not seem to understand what she says, and does not look to the left. If the nurse gently turns Mrs. Smith’s head, so that the dessert comes into sight, in the preserved right half of her visual field, she says, “Oh, there it is―it wasn’t there before.” Actually, she has totally lost the idea of “left.” Sometimes, she complains that her portions are too small, but this is because she only eats from the right half of the plate―it does not occur to her that it has a left half as well.",
		"A mechanic had a shop student who was wanting to acquire the knowledge of what it truly meant to be a mechanic. Taking the student in, the mechanic showed him the ins and outs of being a mechanic in that shop. When he asked the student a question, he always congratulated him when the answer he provided was correct. Even when the answer was not, he encouraged the student to think of the right answer. In the rare events when he could not think of the right answer, the mechanic told him to go look in his book instead. The mechanic also said that the student had someone who believed in him and his ability to become a mechanic.",
		"Medicine became big business with the expansion of new, higher-cost treatments and the increased numbers of health care providers in the United States. As more health care providers entered the market, competition increased among them. Interestingly, the increase in competition led health care providers to recommend more services to the persons they served. This phenomenon reflects a unique feature in the health care industry―provider-induced demand, which allows health care providers to maintain their income even as competition increases. Average consumers of health care do not know how to diagnose their medical conditions and do not have a license to order services or prescribe medications. So consumers rely on the knowledge of health care providers to determine what services are needed, even though they stand to make more money by ordering more services.",
		"Sir Humphry Davy recognized ‘the potential scientist’ in Michael Faraday. At that time Davy was working on chlorine. He was working very hard to prove that chlorine was an element and not a compound of oxygen as held by many scientists of the day. Davy encouraged Faraday to assist him in his experiments, and Faraday agreed with great enthusiasm. In October 1813, Davy went upon a tour of Europe along with his wife. He asked Faraday to accompany him as his assistant. Faraday’s pleasure knew no bounds on this bonus offer. He accepted the offer and went along with Davy and his wife and a few others. Till then, Faraday had not seen much outside London. Davy’s offer was simply exciting. Faraday had to resign his job before going on the tour. However, Davy promised to reappoint him on their returning from the tour. The tour was a wonderful opportunity for self­education.",
		"Most of us probably parent the way we were parented. Louise, a mother who attended my seminars, shared how her mother dealt with sibling fighting. Louise said her mother’s infamous threat was always, “If you kids don’t stop fighting, I’m going to knock your three heads together!” Louise and her siblings were always puzzled about the specifics of how their mother would actually accomplish such a task, which, thankfully, she never attempted. But what drove her mother to make this empty threat? Extreme annoyance with the sibling arguments, probably. No doubt, Louise’s mother had learned this threatening tactic from her own mother, and, in the absence of any other parenting tools she knew of, she said it to her own children, regardless of whether it worked. If Louise had not learned the effective parenting skills taught in the seminars, she would probably be using similarly ineffective threatening techniques with her own children today!",
		"A middle­aged man once asked a young mindfulness teacher for meditation instructions in plain language. He suggested that the man carve out five or ten minutes every day to sit comfortably or lie down and focus on his breathing. When thoughts came to mind, the young teacher told him to ignore them and go back to focusing on his breath. Although the middle­aged man remembered the instructions of his teacher, he couldn’t follow them. When his mind got busy, he was sucked into a mental loop of analyzing his problems. When he wasn’t thinking, he’d get bored and zone out. Either way, this hopeful new meditator didn’t feel that his time was well spent. When he was thinking and meditating, he figured he’d be better off sitting at his desk, and when he zoned out while meditating, he figured he’d be better off daydreaming on a long chair in the backyard.",
		"Jack closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Then Dr. Davis showed up and plugged in his saw. Jack didn’t know if he was curious or just scared, but he had to watch as the blade spun toward his arm. The high­pitched scream filled the small room and bounced off the cement block walls. He flinched to cover his ears, but Dr. Davis said, “Jack, hold still now. This’ll only take a minute.” Plaster dust sprayed up like a rooster tail as the saw sank into his cast. He ignored the dust flying and stared without blinking while Dr. Davis moved the blade up and down his arm, cutting deeper and deeper until the tension of the cast released. Slowly and skillfully, Dr. Davis moved the blade close to Jack’s pale skin as he cut the last bits of fiber that still held. Finally, the cast popped apart. Jack’s flattened arm hairs tried to stand on end as air rushed around them for the first time in weeks.",
		"My mom worked as a nurse in a clinic in Vallejo, California. One day a patient, Catherine, came into the clinic and my mom admired her dress. The woman explained that she had made the dress and that she used to be a seamstress when she lived in her home country of Jamaica. She had recently moved to the U.S. and hadn’t been able to bring her sewing machine with her and wasn’t able to afford to buy one. Soon after their meeting, my mom continued to think about this lovely Jamaican woman. There had to be something she could do to help her. Searching the thrift shops in our area, my mom finally found a used sewing machine. It was the perfect gift for her new acquaintance. It wasn’t long before my mom began bringing her clothing in need of repair or requiring alterations. Soon, Catherine was making clothes for our family. Eventually she was able to start a small seamstress business.",
		"John was once in the office of a manager, Michael, when the phone rang. Immediately, Michael bellowed, “That disgusting phone never stops ringing.” He then proceeded to pick it up and engage in a fifteen-minute conversation while John waited. When he finally hung up, he looked exhausted and frustrated. He apologized as the phone rang once again. He later confessed that he was having a great deal of trouble completing his tasks because of the volume of calls he was responding to. At some point John asked him, “Have you ever considered having a certain period of time when you simply don’t answer the phone?” Michael said, “As a matter of fact, no,” looking at him with a puzzled look. It turned out that this simple suggestion helped Michael not only to relax, but to get more work done as well. Like many people, he didn’t need hours of uninterrupted time, but he did need some!",
		"A notable and celebrated contemporary of Alfred Nobel was Gösta Mittag­Leffler. Mittag­Leffler, a student of the celebrated mathematician Karl Weierstrass, was a prominent mathematician in his own right. He married well, and as a result lived in a grand mansion in Djursholm, Sweden― just outside of Stockholm. Now Mittag­Leffler was a true celebrity; his name was in the newspapers all the time. He dressed like a dandy, and was really a man about town. Nobel was an unattractive, dull, solitary bachelor. He never married, and as far as we know he never had a lady friend in his entire adult life. He was extremely jealous of Mittag­Leffler and the lifestyle that he led. Mittag­Leffler was the most prominent and celebrated scientist in all of Sweden. Some thought it likely that, were there a Nobel Prize in mathematics, he would have received it. This may have influenced Alfred Nobel’s decision not to found a prize in mathematics.",
		"When the tea tray was being carried across the room to their table, Chloe’s eyes rounded and she almost gasped out loud. There were lots of tiny desserts and mini sandwiches and small biscuit­looking things. Where to start? Where to start? Her grandmother smiled and winked at her from across the table. Chloe winked back. She took a sip of the sweet tea and waited for her grandmother to make the first move. She carefully mirrored her grandmother’s actions and started with a small, delicate sandwich. It was good. She ate it up and selected another. After a time, all the sandwiches were eaten up and Chloe boldly chose the biscuit­looking thing before her grandmother. “Aren’t the scones lovely, dear?” asked her grandmother, as she spread cream and jam on hers. Scones, was that what they were called? Chloe had already started to eat hers without the cream and jam; in fact, it was mostly all in her mouth already.",
		"Nancy was struggling to see the positive when her teen daughter was experiencing a negative perspective on her life and abilities. In her desire to parent intentionally, she went into her daughter’s room and noted one positive accomplishment she had observed. “I know you’ve been having a hard time lately, and you aren’t feeling really good or positive about your life. But you did a great job cleaning up your room today, and I know that must have been a big effort for you.” The next day, to Nancy’s surprise, the teen girl seemed somewhat cheerful. In passing, she said, “Mom, thanks for saying the positive thing about me yesterday. I was feeling so down and couldn’t think of anything good about myself. After you said that positive thing, it helped me see one good quality in myself, and I’ve been holding onto those words.”",
		"The dancers stood on a two-step elevated stage, so that there was a natural gap between those who came to dance and those who came to watch. The host randomly pulled the name of a well-known dancer, Linx, out of a hat. People cheered. According to the format, Linx had to “call out” another dancer to battle him on stage. Instead of deliberately choosing someone, however, he decided to select his opponent randomly by making himself into a human spin-wheel. He propelled himself into a backspin, covered his eyes, and extended his arm above his head. When his body finally stopped spinning, his arm pointed away from the dancers on stage and directly at Dan Tres, standing among the spectators. The crowd erupted in “Ohhhhs!” because he was an older family man who had not danced hip-hop in many years, while the much younger Linx was a nimble b-boy. Linx looked embarrassed, but nonetheless he called out the respected elder to battle.",
		"Dr. Paul Odland and his friend Bob travel frequently to South America, where they provide free medical treatment for disabled children of poor families. One day, they went to a local marketplace. Paul wanted to buy some souvenirs, and he spotted a carving that he liked. The non-English speaking seller was asking 500 pesos for the carving. With Bob acting as interpreter, Paul offered 300 and his opponent proposed 450. The bargaining in the noisy market became spirited, even intense, with Paul stepping up his price slightly and the seller going down slowly. The pace increased so fast that Bob could not keep up with the back-and-forth interpretation. Meanwhile, observing the seller carefully, Paul sensed something wrong in Bob’s interpretation. In fact, the seller had gone below Paul’s last offer. When Paul raised his doubt, Bob instantly recognized the error and corrected his interpretation. At length, they settled the deal, and he was delighted to purchase the carving at a reasonable price and thanked Bob.",
		"Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert, one of the most successful comic strips of all time, says that two personal letters dramatically changed his life. One night he was watching a PBS-TV program about cartooning, when he decided to write to the host of the show, Jack Cassady, to ask for his advice about becoming a cartoonist. Much to his surprise, he heard back from Cassady within a few weeks in the form of a handwritten letter. The letter advised Adams not to be discouraged if he received early rejections. Adams got inspired and submitted some cartoons, but he was quickly rejected. Not following Cassady’s advice, he became discouraged, put his materials away, and decided to forget cartooning as a career. About fifteen months later, he was surprised to receive yet another letter from Cassady, especially since he hadn’t thanked him for his original advice. He acted again on Cassady’s encouragement, but this time he stuck with it and obviously hit it big."
